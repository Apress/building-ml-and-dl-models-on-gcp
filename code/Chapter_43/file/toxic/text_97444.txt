This is ridiculous
Aside from the reference not actually calling it a war crime saying that some characterize it as one doesnt make it one
War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war  The key words here are laws and war  Unless one lives in a corrupt town laws are made by legislatures or in this case ratified by them after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their militarys generals  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process  The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral
Im deleting this section  Its not salvageable
