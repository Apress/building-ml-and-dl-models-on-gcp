Admins have free reign 

People keep removing the above questions from a user and I believe they are ligitimate questions I would like to see some more accountability from this admin Seems many people have issues with him yet he is allowed to maintain his status as admin and abuse his position daily

Does Wikipedia support and encourage the public use of foul language Doesnt wikipedia take seriously copyright protection If the US Library of congress is not a source that can be cited what then is

I believe Phil Sandifer needs to answer questions when posed this is his responsiblity as a Wikipedia appointed admin

More important as an admin Phil you have the responsibility to lead by example and using degrading swear words like Fu is disgraceful
