Im sorry that I must say this I have never come across a more idiotic editor on Wikipedia Congratulations on making it to the top of my list I mean that in a congratulatory sense entirely in no way is it meant to offend or sound sarcastic I wouldnt call you an editor though Youre more of a pollutant to this project and one with extreme perversion of perception Please reread the discussion at the talk page Based on what you last posted there it is painfully obvious that you ignored or did not comprehend much of what I tried explaining to you multiple times at that talk page
