Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient peoples may have accepted homosexuality Why do you have to distort history to fit your image 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the buttlets get that straightno pun intended

second im sure there was gay shit back in the day like in every culturebut i dont believe everyone was doing itjust because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay actdoesnt mean everyone back then was gay

thirdthere is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophilei say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see themthat doesnt mean i want their asslook at shaq and wade slapping each others ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay

fourthjust because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gaydoesnt mean they werealot of plays especially comedies were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupidlike calling them gayjust look at comedies now making fun of peoplesomeone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit but we all know he is straight

fifthi hate gay propagandai know they are people blah blah blahbut to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is patheticjust because there are no great gay people in history doesnt mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look goodfrom alexander to hitler to lincolnyou guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive Robin Lane Fox writes Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover This is uncertain 16 And according to Mary Renault who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers 17

key words uncertain no historian
