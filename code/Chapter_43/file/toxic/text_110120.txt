Adultchild sex  child sexual abuse 

Copied from WPANI ohio 

 Ive asked this question before but Ive never had an understandable explanation  How is the article a POV fork  If its been explained previously just point me to the diff  Ive seen plenty of people say its a POV fork but what I see is a valueneutral etic approach to a topic thats as old as humanity itself  Even if the title is POV the content can be used in other articles so why delete it ohio 

 Adultchild sex is a euphemism for child sexual abuse and any article titled Adultchild sex is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse Exactly as if someone took an article Nazi genocide and retitled or made a fork entitled Nazi demographic adjustments We understand that you dont agree with this but if you still dont understand it then you had better look to yourself   

 Exactly as Hero said As a contemporary example Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide One is just a fancy name for the other        0341 UTC  6 Mar 08

I dont see the logic of that  Adultchild sex the term goes no further than plain description  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article but I dont see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse  The term itself can advance no agenda  It is materially different from the genocide  demographic adjustments example which may invoke Godwins law  As for VPs example ethnic cleansing means something different from but related to genocide just as adultchild sex does with child sexual abuse  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV  Where is the POV in it  Since this seems not to be much of an ANI question I invite replies at my talk page ohio
