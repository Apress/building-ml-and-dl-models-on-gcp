Also what about the word chink on your userpage Whereas negro may be considered offensive by some although Ive never heard of it being used in offensive context And negro is used often in nonoffensive contexts like in Martin Luther King Jrs speeches the names of various black organizations    etc I believe chink is pretty much always considered offensive Why do you have it on your userpage

You are obviously a troll
