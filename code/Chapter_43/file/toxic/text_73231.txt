LOL I do notice that I get in more trouble when I am drinking and editing since I spout more spite after a handful of High LifesI I just wished the cancer line would have been an intentional attack on my end since the interpretation of it is exactly how I feel even though I would have used other words I did call his editing toxic in a previous comment so maybe I do deserve some reprimand if we are going retroactively Doesnt matter anyways Editors will continue to be problematic in the topic area but Nableezy gone is a net gain Lchaim I say sk√•l with a headbutt my good sir
