Verse 1
Konnichiwa senpai
Please notice me
I watch Asian cartoons
Im a weeaboo

I live in my moms house
Im like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
Cause Im a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
Youre such a fucking pleb are you even even Japanese bro

I havent showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
Cause all of a sudden
I think Im Japanese

Chorus
Yes Im a weeaboo x4
A filthy weeaboo
Narutos so overrated
A dirty weeaboo
You wanna see my katana collection
A fucking weeaboo
Im learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone
A disgusting weeaboo
So Im like basically Japanese now

Verse 2
I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now im qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

Chorus
Yes Im a weeaboo
Uh duh everybody wears kimonos
Yes Im a weeaboo
Ninjas are still real okay
Yes Im a weeaboo
Uh kkonnichiwa
Yes Im a weeaboo
Domo arigato
A filthy weeaboo

A dirty weeaboo
A fucking weeaboo
