TFG you are an idiot I NEVER believed in Santa Claus and I used to go around to all the stupid kids in my 1st and 2ndgrade class and tell them Santa wasnt real The teacher told me to stop but I didnt because I was smart and logical even at 7 years of age If I could be logical at that age any kid can stupid parents like you are getting in the way of kids developing their logic skills From the time I first heard of Santa Claus when I was 4 years old I ALWAYS knew he was fictional How come I knew it and yet youre saying children shouldnt find out What if its a smart and logical child like me who asks questions about the logical fallacies you know like I DID because Im SMART
