Wow 

Way to assume my man  Im not saying that all of the stories about King Arthur were true but Excalibur was a very real sword and I do have it in my possession  This is an irrefutable fact  I have been interviewed by many historians and the like and youre the first one that seems to think you know more than all of them

Can you prove that Im wrong  Not only that my sword isnt the real thing but that my claiming it is is such a travesty that you cannot allow anyone else to see it at all  I wonder what would happen if the other Wikipedophiles got their poor little minds corrupted by a comment on a talk page eh

Referring to   Next time do some research  I wont bring it up again but its insulting to have someone like you treat me like a liar
