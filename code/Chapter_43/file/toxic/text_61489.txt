First point  it was not only treated as mental illness but as criminal activity
 Second point  you should only refer to homosexual romance in the lead if there is a section that deals with homosexual romance in the body of the text as the lead is a summary of what is in the body and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens who is a notable sociologist but no authority on sexuality sexology  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular use the term  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance which shows the term can be taken for granted fine  otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead 
 Third point my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent because I have only come across the term romance used in this context at conferences ironically or critically  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text for example Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured
