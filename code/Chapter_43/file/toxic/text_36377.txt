Attempts to circumvent AfD 

The AfD for Wikifiddler will determine whether the contents will stay under that title whether they will be merged to a different article or whether they will be deleted without merge  Your repeated copying of the entire article to Andrew Orlowski before the conclusion of that AfD is an attempt to circumvent the process and the fact that you are doing so in bad faith aware that what you do is wrong is shown by your falsely flagging it each time as a minor edit disputed edits are never minor edits refusing to use an edit summary and your failure to note on either talk page that you are copying the entire contents of one article verbatim into the other  Your chutzpah in describing it as vandalism when these badfaith edits of yours are reverted is stupidity  Are you really so very in love with Orlowski that when he rants about Wikipedians who act badly you have to leap to fulfill his prophecy by exhibiting the worst behavior you can calculate   
Id have to say the same to you You have been stupid enough to blank out and revert the article even though I have extensively added to the material Since Orlowski clearly is watching Wikipedia closely see the material you blanked out you moron I hope hes watching this discussion and finding it as amusing as I do Your repeated attempts to censor this material are laughable
