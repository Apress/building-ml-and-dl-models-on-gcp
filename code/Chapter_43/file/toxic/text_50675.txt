City departments

As of 70 minutes ago Sturgeon bay fire dept responded to the holiday motel right at the east end of the downtown bridge

Get this they have 2 pumpers 1 mini pumper 1 tanker 1 ladder truck and 1 rescue truck from the city AS WELL AS 1 pumper 1 mini pumper and 1 rescue from the southern door fire dept And they have only started as of this writing to try and put it out Even then there are only 3 people actively fighting the fire  the rest are just standing around WATCHING

WHAT THE F When did the fire dept turn wimps And WHY are the citizens paying for all these firefighters when theyre not doing anything

Will fasttrack the photos and get them up on the sturgeon bay yahoo group by tuesday should anyone care to see them
