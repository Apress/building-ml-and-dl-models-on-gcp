Yes douche but an article DOES have to be neutral  Happyme22 has consistently been aggressiv in keeping the Nancy Reagan article skewed towards her favor  If you check that articles talk page you will see several admissions by him that he IS clearly in her favor and that his edits to her article are aggressive in such a manner that there should be no question of his bias  That you and other adtiorsadministrators have been so lax in blocking him for making nonNPOV edits to her articleonly goes to prove again that Wikipedia is nothing more than a media manipulated brainwashing machine  Fuck you Wikipedai you just lost a user ever
