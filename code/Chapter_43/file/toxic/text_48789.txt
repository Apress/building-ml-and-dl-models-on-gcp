Sitush you are an ass  I do not know who let you loose on Wikipedia NCRT textbooks are writtin from the sources in the India Office Archive Every historical work including that of Seely depends to some extent on primary sources that work has been published and the authors of the Singahi article have cited from it
These are spurious and non academic grounds of objecting to the article Its just making mischief I invite anybody from a higer academic background to examine all Sitush   edits 

Examining Situshtalk edits all over Wikipedia as I have done establishes he is a menace and taking wikipedia backwards Sitush I suspect you are just a 14 year old kid treating wikipedia as a toy
