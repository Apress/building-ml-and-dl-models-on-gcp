Correction to Karljoos 
Karljoos you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country How in the hell is that possible Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries Are you ok

Also according to europeans not ignorant americans hispanic is an admixture of races in south america Therefore spaniards are not classified as hispanic 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america This is not wholly true Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture This is compounded further by south americas distinct racial differences which if you were smart you would indeed know

Just for the record I am of spaniard descent I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do All europeans dont view spaniards as hispanic as a matter of fact 

Also since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic it should be therefore fair to classify afroamericans and native americans in america as anglosaxons also This is due to the fact that afroamericans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglosaxon admixture As a result I will add this fact to wikipedias anglosaxon article AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES So I better not get idiot americans disputing this
