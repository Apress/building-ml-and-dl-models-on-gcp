Removing my edits 

You are a fucking bastard There was no reason to remove what I added to the great intelligence and list of Doctor Who villians pages You stuck up arsehole Can you understand what this means I think Ive simplified it enough for a dullard like you I you still struggle to understand I suggest you return to the yank equivalent of playgroup and restart your education My additions were relevant There is no reason not to include things not from the TV Doctor Who is also a radio series many novels play etc stop editing Doctor Who articles you dont know anything about the show Thick stuckup prick
