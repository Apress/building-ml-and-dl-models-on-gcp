DeCausa you are such an idiot I was talking about the origin of the Kurds Since Kurds are heterogeneous people I used that statement You need to read what I wrote thoroughly Wikipedia is such full of crap I gave many links to my statement on  Joshs page I know what I am writing is facts I did what you asked by writing in this talk page Wikipedia even refers to the Kurdish language as languageswhich does not even make any sense I am a Kurd myself I know what I am talking about Please give me at least 2 reliable sources that refers to the Kurdish language as languages The facts I wrote about the Kurdish language can even by seen on Wikipedia I have information I have studied You act as if I am just using information I got out of nowhere When in fact it is those people that you allow to change information which create these problems You did not even allow anybody to look at my proposal before you jumped in I posted this proposal only a few hours ago
