Hey Whats Up 

Hey Pink Floyd guy
I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied Im going through deep shit when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa I started contributing out of altruism 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches for self righteous incompetent dickheads  can I say that or am I violating WPDickhead to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention his 15 minutes of fame went to his head All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long To up his look at me count he merely transferred sections that other people created to make it look like an article he started I read extensively about him he is a publicity hound and I find his behavior pretty frigging disturbing Soooo Im not going anywhere I just have to cool out with my childish hissy fits and use the WPBlah Blah and according to WPYadda Yadda BS 

My life is a bit of a horror show right now so I might not be able to edit anything after tonight but dont let a dickhead screwup what could be meaningful information for other people Proper knowledge can help people like your information on Rumination syndrome Whether or not some dick WPDickhead has a college degree or is a physician means squat Im going to undue some damage tonight I think there was useful information on some of those pages if I cant get back for a while dont let dickheads fuck it up Can I say fuck it up
