THIS ARTICLE IS AN INSULT TO OBJECTIVITY
This article does a very poor job of maintaining an objective stance it is undeniable It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and cosponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003

It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an F rating last Congressional session
