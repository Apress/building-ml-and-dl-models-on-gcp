Well dear Ahasuerus It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you Where they cant kill you they censor you Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest but when the interest of Islam comes in they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail But that is another story This article started with some explanation like this

In recent years especially after the 911 some observers including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all nonIslamic countries They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it the todays useful idiots 

Ali Sina states They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the nonMuslim countries and destroy them from within  The same author writes More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die Trying to appease Muslims is foolish It is informed by ignorance of Islam Most cancers are treatable if detected in time But if ignored they will grow to a stage that will kill you Today we have the choice We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses 

Muslims obviously dont like Ali Sina For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality has yet to show that in actions I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her I have still to be convinced of that claim I found out that she is Iranian like Ali Sina but of course most Iranians are still Muslims She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all but generally critical views about Islam do not survive Why If Wikipedia is impartial shouldnt we give equal space to both sides Would we accept if eg scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult What is happening is very disturbing There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution hate speech What about the Quran Isnt that book a hate speech  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules 

If you try to write anything that Muslims dont like they will delete it with invalid justifications This is a very disturbing trend For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because as they said he is not notable There are 200000 pages talking about faith freedom international There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him Doesnt all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed 

Sorry this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss Is there a place to do that  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion it loses its credibility fast  0513 2
