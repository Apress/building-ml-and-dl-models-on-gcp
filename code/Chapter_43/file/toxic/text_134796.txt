Thanks for blocking me I called Tao an idiot and a dumb bastard because I truly belive heshe is one You have these rules to prevent harassment Fine I was just doing it for fun got it out of my system Ill quit now However you should seriously consider a NDBLP rule or No Dumb Bastards and Lazy People Wikipedia is currently a laughing stock a punchline to a joke The reason is that it facilitates lazy people like Tao If you read the entire entry my intention is to improve the page I provide sources I provide a sound argument I provide whats necessary to provide in circumstances like this in order to improve the page What does Tao provide Nothing He clearly has not read the page he clearly does not know the subject and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to be done in circumstances like this making valid claims supported with evidence True I dont take Wikipedia seriously but I believe in its potential I wouldnt do anything that I believe harms it in a substantial way Tao on the other hand is an insidious virus who does little but undermine the value of Wikipedia In a just world he would be the one being blocked This is not a genuine appeal against being blocked because Im the one who asked for it This is an appeal for you to actually read the conversation read my swearfilled diatribe as me antagonizing someone who is genuinely very very very lazy in what he is doing how long did it take to get me blocked after I even begged and taunted  please tell me of the two of us who really should be blocked Of the two of us who is doing the most harm Thank you
