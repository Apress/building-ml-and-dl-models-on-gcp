There are no personal attacks Just me pointing out that you are a really lousy judger of reliable sources If you think that a source which claims Evanescence is gothic rock is reliable enough to put Evanescence in the List of gothic rock bands then you really should not edit the page List of gothic rock bands You obviously dont have any knowledge of the scene if you can not hear the DISTINCT stylistic differences between gothic rock and heavy metal Also you act like a pompous asshat Stop that
