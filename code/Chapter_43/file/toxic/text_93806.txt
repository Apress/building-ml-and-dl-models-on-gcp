WTF do you want from me There are Christian folks who think they hold the monopoly on issues such as god morals and Christendom as such And there are Jewish folks who will do everything to control issues such as Judaism Israel Palestine and parts of ancient history The latter are called the jew crew on fora that I have been on and I dont know or care whether that targets all Jews or all Israelis or who may feel offended by that I did not invent the term nor do or will I give it a second thought I for one am offended by religious fanaticism and nationalism which both are reasons to present Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel and by folks who present biblical tales as accurate history and derive political claims from that And does anybody care
