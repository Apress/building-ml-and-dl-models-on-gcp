Laughing My Ass Off 

At attempts to distinguish between the Queen or King of England and Canada
Half of Parliament the Senate is permanently appointed by the Queens representative Mind you not by the Queen herself because she resides in her capital city of London Yeah not London Ontario either
Whos that on the face of Canadian money again
