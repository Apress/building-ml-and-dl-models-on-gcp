Honestly I dont even remember making those edits in the Orlando Jordan article However I was correct for editing out a statement that was not properly sourced As far as my statement about Kanyon goes it may have been incorrect but its really not a big deal Its just a discussion page not the article Also you didnt have to write to me in such a disrespectful tone Finally learn how to spell You should have written youre at the right place to argue with me then not your Put that in your pipe and smoke it asshole
