OK here we go again To reiterate 60s garage rock did not influence punk music And I dont care what that long haired antipunk hippie Cobain was quoted as saying Youre going to depend your grunge history and contradict punks with only ONE quote And from a hippie who was part of a movement that helped bring punk down That makes NO sense Im going to provide plenty a quote when the time comes that will vastly overshadow the quotes you have And you godamn better not reedit or Ill have you banned Ive done it before and Ill do it again

By the way Im damn happy that idiot Cobain died He did nothing for punk but bury it using stupid american grunge music You lame americans dont know anything about and have no taste for style fashion or music
