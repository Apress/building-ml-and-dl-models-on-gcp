Ankit Fadia  

Ankit Fadia is not a white hat hacker he is a serial liar I am being very kind here
I am a security professional by trade Ankit Fadia was rated by attendees of the DEF CON
20 hacker conference the largest hacker conference in the world as Charlatan of the year

Calling Ankit Fadia an author of several books on the subject of ethical hacking is as 
factual as like calling Barack Obama the President of Russia Ankit Fadia has plagiarized
32 of his first book and over 90 of the first chapter of another 

I am not the only party that knows this article does not merit a page on Wikipedia please
