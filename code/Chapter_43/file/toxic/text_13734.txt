Oh well done Im such a bad boy for attacking the 1st Lord Baron Wikipedia Jesus Christ All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page and now I know  the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out youre prepared to shut me up forcibly and more despicably others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all Well done Now the 1st Lord Baron Wikipedia can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesnt have to exlain why he thinks a 20000 word article and a 15000 word article on something thats being reported around the world has negligible encyclopedic value And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising most right and proper good humor in acting that way And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a Rambling Man Very apt This isnt an encyclopedia its a playground It only remains to be seen what the name Bishonen means but I doubt its anything remotely intellectual probaby just a cartoon reference or something You can block me for 48 hours but on this evidence Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life On further investigation the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins which seems apt seeing as hes probably just a child himself Presumably the use of the phrase Bishonen with her finger on the trigger over there waa meant to be funny but given the context of my complaint its just rather tragic Still back to the real world where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value Ive found the articles myself without the help of the front page but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell in a bucket All you Lords Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia at least you dont seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial so thank fuck for that
