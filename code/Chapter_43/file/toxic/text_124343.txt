OK now youre pissing me off Stop accusing me of things that arent real What in the his noddlinesses name are you talking about I repeat in vulgar and block worthy language because your irrationality is making you impossible I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Ive said it three times repeated it in the post you are refering to and still you went on to make accusations about   a desire to focus on his point of view and not the consensus when I have jsut said I reverted you VANDALISM becuase you vandalised the defintion and not because of the reference to affirmative action If you continue to lie about me I will stop acting friendly towards your edits you irrational individual who I am struggling not to label negatively There is no point about the affirmative action reference as I said in the previous post The fact I would contradict your lies that affirmative action isnt always discrimination when it is is unrelated to that statement and your vandalism If you feel a bit concerned about imaginary things perhaps you should see a fucking psychiatrist because feeling concerned about things that dont exist is extreme paranoia Accuse me of bad faith again without a shred of evidence and i will strive to irritate you for every second until they block me I cannot stand lieing and complete apathy towards actual responding to what I write as opposed to what you imagine I write I advice you do not respond to this with anything but an apology I cant see it being pretty And now some quotes from the post you responded to so that those smarter than you can laugh at your irrational response I have no interest in your line on Affirmative action the arrogance which drives you to completely brush off the rest of the edit and come here and accuse me of POV when I was reverting to a consesnsus over an unsourced redefinition I dont give a toss about the link between affirmatvie action and disscrimination and stop accusing me of things that pop into your head Definetly some irony in how quickly I picked up on that second quote considering its exactly what youre doing
