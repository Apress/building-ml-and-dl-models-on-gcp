An excellent scholarly contribution to the study of the province    Seriously differs from the biased interpretations published by Serbian and Albanian historians or trendy but shallow Western Kosovology experts

A thrilling detective story

Excellent
New York Review of Books

A book every policy expert journalist and lay person must read
Wall Street Journal

Malcolms narrative is gripping even brilliant at times  He takes to his task with the vigor of a detective driven by true passion At times his claims are in terms of Balkan history quite revolutionary
Economist

Covers the whole history of Kosovo with an authority that is often breathtaking and never oppressive
Sunday Times

Brilliantly researched and argued  a magisterial work of history  Kosovo will inevitably be received immediately as an immensely valuable contribution to our understanding and knowledge of a contemporary crisis But to see the book as merely a contribution to the presentday debate is to do it a disservice This is a profound and pioneering work which will endure for generations
Times Literary Supplement

In this aweinspiring work Malcolm has created a vital successor to his Bosnia A Short History and an essential aid to anyone who wishes to understand this tragic region todayHis book is exceptional not only for his unimpeachable rearch but also for his equitable examination of the conflicting ethnic views of what really happened  One cant help speculating on how a clear understanding of the information contained here might have affected the Dayton Accord and history

There you have it Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian But just because he isnt on of your Serbobloggers you come up with all this shit about his works When he says conquered that is exactly what the term means Your map is shit Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25 of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is its name Its Serbonationalists like you Dab and Balkanfever who keep it in its Milosevic devized name And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913 Well What happened Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and Ill say again  if it did Malcolm would have said it If he gets things wrong why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness Answer that one Dab dont confuse the issue It doesnt matter if Kosova was once it Italy I tell you that it has never been in Serbia it only had the bad luck to be in the same genocide state as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia The end
