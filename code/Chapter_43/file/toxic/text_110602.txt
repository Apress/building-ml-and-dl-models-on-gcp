John Cenas wrestling abilities
John Cena is the worst in ring performer that I have ever seen and quite possibly the most ridiculous champion the WWE has ever had Firstly he has no variation to his moveset and aas the ECW crowd rightly said at One Night StandSAME OLD SHIT Its not like the moves he has are even good for hi to continue using them Although Cena is a good entertainer quite frankly he is the worst wrestler I have seen in my life and as for him having a World Title reignI think it is absolutely preposterous He shouldnt even be in the WWEOVW should suit his mediocre half baked sloppy wrestling style better
