To Lcnj You are an idiot I did not threaten you I removed these people from the list because the list contained errors and no article has been written about them No one cares about Joyce Gemayel or any of the other people you are adding As for Wadih el Safi and Elias Rahbani I ask you to write articles about them before adding them to this list Also I dont think anyone who spends his time writing about Bassem Feghali is qualified enough to say Syria assasinated these politicians
