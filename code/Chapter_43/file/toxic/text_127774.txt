You are a halfturk halfarab with no roots who cant even speak or write Persian like a native even in short expressions it is obvious in your case who has no real roots in Iran and all your edits have been about image and fooling yourself about your fantasy of the bogus identity that you have created for yoruself in your mind  Nearly all your contributions to Wikipedia have been about promoting your fake image especially your uncultured fucking Qajar turks and your lizzardmunching arab ancestors and basically your contributions can be summed up as fake image with pretty pictures may i say that the pictures are not nearly as pretty as you think by the way  Also your behaviour in Wikipedia clearly shows the halfArabhalfTurkish blood  You act exactly 100 like a halfarabhalfturk boor with ZERO tolerance and respect for others and ZERO sense of compromise and ZERO sign of culture or civility  Last but not least if you think the Khums financial aid and social programmes for the  Sayyeds is not true and if you have even one single cell of brain in your vacuous cramium why dont you ask yoruself then what exactly Sahme Sadaat part of the Khums means  Does it mean portion for the movie stars  You really ARE dumb arent you  And if you still have doubts since you are from a mullah sayyed family I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want  Simply ask them what Sahme Sadaat portion of the Khums exactly means

Last but not least the Persian Art picture that you have uploaded you have characterized it as the artist mixes blah blah with Qajar art   that is 100 bullshit  Can you provide a link that says the artist has indeed made such claim  That is YOUR claim because you are from a fucking Qajar turk family  I will change it unless you can provide a reliable link that supports that claim ie it must clearly show that the artist has made such a claim
