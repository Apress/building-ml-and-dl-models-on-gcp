Your stupidity 

As you are aware anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you you use the WP3RR the WPSOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying 

As i saw at the top of your page and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting  this occuring regularly in the following

Louise Henriette de BourbonConti  probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it 
Henrietta Anne Stuart  i rearranged the page and added the TemplateHouse of Stuart  clearly a tragedy
Louise Marie Adélaïde de BourbonPenthièvre  added titles and styles  where are they i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way
Victoire of France  changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess LouiseMarie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article  you simply revert back because I did it  all I did was move the TemplateHouse of Bourbon France to a different part of the page Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please dont violate WP3RR or WPSOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT         Shut up

Where is this claim about the WPSOCK even from   another one of your ridiculous  thoughts I will not back down 

I have a small bit of advice for you maybe you should read the WPOWN article for your own clarification on the matter You really are a bore and a selfish one at that

Sure our paths will meet again  Happy editing
