Unfortunately you are an undeniable feeble person who misrepresents reality of the Urantia Fellowship as someone who does not legitimately publish the Urantia Book and is a failure with only as you say hundreds of members The Urantia ReadersIntl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark Saudi Arabia Europe Korea etc Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life 

The Urantia ReadersIntl hosts world wide Internet meetings and has a monthly mailing list that encompasses 6 continents  who still happens to host an annual get together in Florida for the prior members of the Urantia Association of Florida The Urantia Book Fellowship is nothing more then a ban of radical beguiled readers who desire nothing more then to create a golden calf of a an idolatrous Urantia church to appease their pagan animal nature Anyone not self repressed enough to understand simple religious psychology can already see this in you

Deep down inside you know this is true but your subliminal self hatred keeps you in denial of such facts And as such we are going to ask that you Please discontinue removing the Urantia ReadersIntl group and replacing it with the Fellowship link See how that works in contrast So you want to play sound games or do you want to fight fire with fire jerks As such let us repeat the same again  if you delete us we delete you Fellowship if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in and keep ours in the we keep yours in if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us we will place our link above you you want a war you got it
