Really 

YOURE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the evidence you send me are considered

Really Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes Dont show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate which in your case makes sense 1By magnifying this image up to 400 you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green not anywhere close to brown 2What the f is this It look horrendous Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying theyre the same shade when clearly theyre not Lets take a look at a better quality image No brown eyes here

3These eyes can still be called hazel 4Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights and look at Belles hair it looks red 5I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color The difference looks brown and hazel instead of brown and light brown 6Thats not a screenshot and by magnifying the image her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair 7400 zoom in hazel eyes 8What a desperate image you can barely see anything 1000 zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again 9400 zoom in hazel eyes again

Oh yes the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify 10 By magnifying the image up to 400 you can clearly see her eyes look greenlike 11400 zoom in hazel eyes AGAIN

JESUS FING CHRIST You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown ARE YOU COLORBLIND Dont you know how to differentiate colors An you call this SOLID If Belles eyes are hazel than those are indeed solid verified evidence And the screenshots arent even from the Diamond Edition theyre from the Special Edition

Take a look at these pics please Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown I dont think so These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown on what bases are people suppose to believe Belles eyes are brown
