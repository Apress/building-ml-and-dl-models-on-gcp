I was about to suggest that the maths desk is a rarified enviroment and that it lacks a sufficiently large ecosystem to prevent cabin fever breaking out A corollary of that was that I went to look to see if MeniRosenfeld was still on the desks  but what horror youve fallen out with him too How the fuck did you manage that MeniRosenfeld is the nicest person Ive never met Anyway dont take that as an insult but as confirmation of my cabin fever theory
I think the maths desk might benefit from a few semicompetent idiots amongst all the brains  Ive been shot at by MichaelHardy for perceived errors on that desk the last time I was there  it could end becoming a sort of gentlemens club  invitation only  which doesnt really match its purpose Ive had issues with my perception of people demonstrating their superiority rather than actual trying to help the questioner in the past  though that is my purely subjective viewend of essay83100251196
