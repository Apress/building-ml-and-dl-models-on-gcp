Youre from the Netherlands right Maybe an understanding of English would help you out here REPEATEDLY ADDING LINKS means what to you  Adding more than ONE external link to a website I sure hope not I cant imagine how many people youve pissed off because theyve added TWO links to the billions of Wikipedia pages

REPEATEDLY ADDING LINKS means a neverending addition of links It doesnt mean adding 17 applicable relevant valid links in one day and then never contributing again  A good example of REPEATEDLY ADDING LINKS would be user John Doe adding winafreeipodcom to every single Wiki page they come across If you would look at the timestamps  SpecialContributionsVacantlips the user spent a total of a half hour CONTRIBUTING reviews to the relevant album pages Learn the fucking difference between SPAM and CONTRIBUTIONS you pompous Dutch asshole  Im so sick of the people that think they run this website You should stick to your chemistry day job Hugs and kisses   Dirk Beetstras biggest fan and English tutor
PS And please quit acting so chipper with your Thanks and Have a nice day when you have nothing better to do than revert peoples valid contributions because youre a hateful sorry bastard 3 XOXO
