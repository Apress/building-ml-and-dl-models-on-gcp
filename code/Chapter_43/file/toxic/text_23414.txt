An official complaint to where WikiMedia You highly overestimate the officialness of anything here and everything I did was within policy  just because someone violates 3RR doesnt preclude the page from being protected I suppose you could have requested it at WPRFUP which wasnt mentioned above instead Gun Powder Ma chose to come be sarcastically bitchy on my talk page Awesome sorry I wasnt working for you as hard as I should My salary here is a little low At any rate I agree with the gist of the above and I am going to unprotect the article If the obvious SPI starts again  which is fairly certain  notify me or the edit war noticeboard And try not to be a bitch     39
