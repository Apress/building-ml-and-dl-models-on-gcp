Awesome  Even though you were actually idiotic enough to block me for the wrong thing I havent commited vandalism EVER you liar I was verbally abusive towards another editor which despite his irrationality vandalism lieing and accusations of bad faith was indeed inexcusable but at least get it right fool I know being an administrator doesnt really require any actual insight or honesty but when you link to the correct action you could at least portray enough mental capacity to not link to a page that doesnt describe my action abuse as something I have never done vandalism Id also like to say ha I cant believe it took me saying Id be blocked for my comment to be blocked youre really pathetic
