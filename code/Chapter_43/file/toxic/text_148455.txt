Taken quite seriously on Wikipedia 

Yeah I do realize that I think being an active contributor to this site makes you a douchebag which I was kind of hinting at before I think its good to deter users or rather stir up the place because in its proportion to the totality of this shitproject your little society is shallow and incompetent proof of the failure of its principles and on the individual level that its users are lameasses Im having cheap fun because as far as I know you from interacting with you youre ridiculously pathetic
