Nigger was not exactly my choice of words 

If you bother to read the article on Mark Fuhrman and you have an IQ at my level or higher you might recognize that my reference to niggerlover was satirical and that it is welldocumentated that Mr Fuhrman is the one who quite notably used that racial epitaph so freely and later lied about it later under oath and quite appropriately was stripped of his law enforcement duties forever He deserves to have it rubbed in his nose and for the rest of you to reminded of that on a regular basis lest he be whitewashed  Pun inteneded
