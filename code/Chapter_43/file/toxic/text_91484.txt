On shooting yourself in the foot 

I see on your user page you whine about confronting supposed homophobia and transphobia Consider the possibility that what youre actually confronting is the consequences of your own jerkish behavior Its nice that you decided to initiate a discussion thread about an important substantive matter but when you needlessly title it with an accusation about another user you bring discredit only to yourself If you had cared to look at the articles Talk archives as Id suggested you would have found that I am one of the editors who has made sureagainst some dedicated oppositionthat the article has contained more than a single brief sentence on samesex marriage In other words you might have figured out that that I was your potential ally in the current debate But you decided to pursue things in a fashion which I gather is customary for you Very well then Piss off jerk Whine about that
