No academics go about denying homosexuality of distinguished and respectable people like this articles namesake  The charge of homosexuality claims lays with those such as you and those you mention who plaster their revisionism over and rub such greater people than yourselves in the mud all for the notoreity of doing so  Im pretty sure you would be the type to go up to such people like Fred Phelps or George W Bush or John Ashcroft or Pope Benedict XVI and call them homosexuals to their faces just because of the thrill of calling them hypocrites for opposing homosexuality which Stuart doubtlessly did himself  Churchmen are so vulnerable to this crap you spread around  Keep your diseases to yourself thank you very much
