Warning about your behavior 

Cush you had a conniption when I used an offcolor term to describe you on my own talk page  I was blocked for it for 24 hours  But as the following diffs show you are regularly abusive foulmouthed and bigoted and your refusal to WPAGF and denigration of other editors has been going on for too long  Im asking you to stop  Accept the fact that your opinion about religion is your opinion and doesnt have any special standing on Wikipedia

These diffs are a partial list  I got tired of going back through your history  But its easy enough to extend the list  Change your behavior and your attitude please
