I can read Japanese as well as about 78 other languages if you are interested But no I did not post that reference and please dont write in a language I assume you cannot write in In fact please dont live in a world I assume you should not live in

No article is prohibited as a use for reference Use of reference has nothing to do with copyrights Study your books

If sales information are unencyclopedic I guess we should delete the List of bestselling music artists instead of discussing about it right We wont see them on the Japanese Wikipedia because the Japanese Wikipedia frankly sucks

Take care herunar
