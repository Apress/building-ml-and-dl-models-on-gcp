By78 is not doing because something need to be clarified but its deliberate All links with detailed explanation exists but still act like a dumb person This is deliberate And why did you admin revert this edit This is what I asked The word dumb there never means he is dumb you read it wrongly by saying I had called him dumb Read it again I said he is acting like a dumb person The meaning of it is he is really smart and wants his version to stay and he is deliberately doing it Also I request you to look at his edits It also has a racist angle Now dont come to me and say you called him a racist Better you check his edits He is showing signs of dislike for a particular race otherwise one will not try deliberately attempt to tarnish the image of one race Its not part of ordinary edits because we dont find it with anyother countries Like when I edit Wikipedia my subject is military matters and I do contribute to all articles and dont pinpoint something and inject negative views only about a particular race or country in the articles
