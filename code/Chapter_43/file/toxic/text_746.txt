You know I was thinking

Nobody really attacked me before I revealed my age here  After I announced that I was 14 I was subject to a constant storm of harassment and abuse

The same thing goes for when I was on The Sandbox when I was 11  Before people knew my age they didnt care  After I told them my age they hated me

Its just so amusing how the idiot Soapboxers think of teenagers as being responsible for the decline of The Soapbox like it was ever any good to begin with  This is funny because the adults are the dumbest people here  Mauricio Chuppah Redneckgirl Pinky Scooby GG ForeverLostTinkerbell greenrabbit StarRocketsInFlight BreeRobinson enigma72 CocaineNightmares TokyoDome Chad_OchoCinco Steve Lake

all adults

The teenage posters here are typically the smartest ones  Lets see GDawg Head_Banging_Brunette ClassicAge Metropolis even though hes a bipolar weirdo ChrisScript just to name a few

All I ever see adults posting is rate my poo1 my ballz smell funny whoz hawter me or ur mom i like to rape little girls and HEY GUYZ LOOK AT ME IM AN ATTENTION WHORE111  The adult posters here are immature moronic savage bullies with the mental capacity of a retarded 4yearold

Whereas most of the teenagers here are thoughtful intelligent mature and often profound  But theyre subject to constant schoolyard bullying by the idiot adult posters who think theyre somehow superior because they were born and dropped on their head earlier

Soapbox logic never fails to amuse me
