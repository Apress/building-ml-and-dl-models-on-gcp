The same group of tandem editors from several years ago still try and control this article They want to eliminate an article about one of the major social movements  the group that started it 
Wikipedia is known for special interest control and buddy editing Its a pity and the reason a serious article on an important American group is being tried to be done away with by tandem editors that obviously object for some reason to the content The past clearly shows the same team of tandem editors here
Beagle and Johnphos are tandem editors as is Lawrencekhoo and Epipelagic One of the most significant groups in American history and they want to get rid of the article Its pathetic and shows the weakness of en Wikipedia Lawrencekhoo is a mainstream economist who ax grinds economic articles Google his name for his economic beliefs Gino And fifle fool it does not have a fucking thing to do with communism you dumb ass Thanks
