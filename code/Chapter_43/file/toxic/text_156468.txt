Ive been a Wikipedian since 22 July 2006 and an administrator since 19 November 2007

I am an architect and a native West Virginian Im old enough to remember when Wordstar on an amber screen was really cool when a control key really controlled something and I started working with AutoCAD at version 725 My current project is is the translation of architecturerelated articles from the French Wikipedia to the English wiki

   Wow real fucking great You design buildings Who gives a fuck honestly I swear what is it with you people You fuck around with your ecocks by running around reversing edits and whatnot Its really starting to piss me off Also West Virginia is a shithole sorry to tell you Ive driven through many times and was NOT impressed Luckily faggots such as yourself live within its confines which means I only have to encounter you on the Internet but I digress

  You also go out of your way to mention that youre in essence old Thatsgreat Really Im impressed youve lived long enough to resort to reversing edits on the an Internet reference Congradafuckinglations on that one 

   I know I know youre going to ban me The ease of proxies makes your threats utterly worthless although I know that wont stop you from trying you miserable scum 

   Good day to you sir
