Ahhhh     it always feels good to have the last word to get in the last word  Although I dont sign my edits you can see that from the SinBot that I am the person that started this Discussion of formatting the table LOL  Yes good to see that everybody has more or less agreed upon a nondescript colour format  fair enough better than no colour formatting for headings  Jack Merridew  I see that you went and posted somewhere else that Miley Cyruss fans cant have their own colour scheme  Idiot I had never even heard of this Miley Cyrus creature until I happened upon her page and  to be quite frank  I dont think I would like her music if I were to hear it  Im 55 years old  Nitwit  But youre a knowitall arent you Jack  You know how I know that  Because I went and looked at your edits and you apparently spend half of every day editing Wikipedia entries and most of your edits are to do with table formatting and font formatting that you dont like  Please  Get a life
