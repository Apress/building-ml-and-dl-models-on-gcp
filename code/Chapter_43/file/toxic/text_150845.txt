Image tagging 
Look mate what IS your problem with where images come from They make wikipedia a better place regardless of source and for the record I think that ALL of my images qualify as fair use Youre actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia systematically going after people and questioning everything they do Who told you to do this Why take the law into your own hands Ask yourself this who are you protecting You wanna play cops and robbers go and joing the freaking police Do something useful rather than wasting your life on here What is your job Cos this aint real life buddy and if its your only hobby I feel bad for you I mean really bad I thinks its quite sad that your only reason for using wikipedia is to actively reverse what other people do rather than to actively create content I will review all the images you helpfully tagged for me but Im getting real tired of you ducking me man Peace out
