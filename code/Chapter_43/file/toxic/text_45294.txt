SCIENTIFIC SKEPTIC  

He never went to college so why this article calls him a scientific skeptic  May be some people of his skeptic team are real scientifics they sure got graded from some college but this debunker never went to any college  so how can wikipedia call him a scientific Do you know at least if he uses a scientific method for whatever he tries to debunk 
People he didnt finished high school

You cant even write proper English What college did you go to  Whats up Doc 
Thanks for the link though Thats a great article on the amazing one   

 I think scientific skepticism is related to following the scientific method not formal education h2g2bob talk 
For sure The user 822242305 would likely know that Its just trolling behavior  Whats up Doc 

Im not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 1213 years old wikipedia nonlife geek you know what Im talkng about
Oh we know what youre talking about all right Trust me   
His IP is French so yeah I wont hold his English skills against him His personality and his intellectual abilities however are things that I will hold against him 
Back on topic though it is a common mistake that people make People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert and knowing what the expert is actually able to do instead of assuming that expert  god  that is a skill that many people lack I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise   

So according to you its enough to only suspect his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background   I mean is this the way wikipedia works  you suspect how sure is that why didnt you even wonder that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career dont you think 
I cant believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info simply pitiousPreceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs 
I guess we should leave the no highschool line in there  It has nothing to do with scietific vs nonscientific   His methods are unquestionably scientific which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge    
I added it back in with a bit of useful context and minus the inferred line about never having been to college which is not supported by the given source   

 Works for me  Im guessing if he can teach college without a highschool degree he could have attended college as well      

The IP again demonstrates that hes either a troll or an idiot or both  Whats up Doc
