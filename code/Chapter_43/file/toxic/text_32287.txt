The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy by being arrogant lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop His worrying obsession with NFCC9 is his excuse for being a twat he is deliberately making the workshop nonfunctional For the IW to work properly we have to be able to either see or be able to link to the image being requested Now Mr Dick esq comes along deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link But will Hammersoft do this No he has refused point blank This I firmly definitely and firmly puts him in the dick category His arrogance his laziness his Borglike obsession with NFCC9 and his truculence are disrupting a valuable resource with WP for no purpose I would be grateful if you could copy and paste this as a response to his accusations at the incident board Especially now youve effectively stopped me posting there This is not an unblock request as I dont care one way or another its WPs loss if I cant sort out image requests for 24hrs its not my loss This is a request though that Hammersoft either stays away from the IW or that he implements the methods weve informed him of
