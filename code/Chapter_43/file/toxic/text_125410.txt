Your passiveaggressive dickwaving is exactly the sort of pennyante tinpot authoritarianism which makes Wikipedia such an unpleasant place to participate  Ive already told you repeatedly that I dont wish to have any further discussion with you  repeatedly  yet you insist on having the last word on my own user page no less  If anyone else but an administrator did that theyd call it trolling and theyd be right  I made a WPBOLD edit in good faith which apparently gave you some kind of atomic wedgie  You reverted it did some triumphant teabagging on my user page and at this point your duty was over  Instead here you are still making vague threats and scary noises despite or because of my request that you shove off and stop trolling up my user page  You reverted my edit and did aa crazed monkey dance over the body of your slain enemy  Since its clearly a matter of supreme importance to you and experience has told me that Wikipedia articles belong to the person with the most intense OCD I have not bothered and will not bother to reinstate the edit  Therefore you have no reason to be here on my user page trying to intimidate me with your awesome and terrifying authoritay  Kindly go away
