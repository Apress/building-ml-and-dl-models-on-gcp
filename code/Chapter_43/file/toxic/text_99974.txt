youre wrong IAR applies to admins and regular editors alike 
 
You have provided no evidence of that    As I said   I have the facts and you guys just have bullshit
 
What is a regular editor    I am not a regular editor  I am an occasional editor
 
The Ignore All Rules rule does not mean there can be one set of rule exceptions for you and another set of rule exceptions for me     We can agree on an exception to the rules  but the exception must apply equally to both of us   For example   we could agree that it is OK here to break the Wikipedia rule against using personal blogs as sources    But that would mean that links to my blog must be allowed here and could not be excluded by arbitrary  discriminatory distinctions between crappy personal blogs and reputable personal blogs 
 
As Fatheaded Ed Brayton would say  you are full of batshit wingnuttery
