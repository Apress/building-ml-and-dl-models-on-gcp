Your creepy fucking head 

Hello jimmy boy

Ive just started editing this Wikipedia When I go to other users pages I often find your creepy fucking head appearing from the left side of the screen

Its disgusting Im an adult and I dont need a note from you

Could you ask one of your programmers to stop having your creepy fucking head appear on the left side of peoples screens Ive asked my brother to kill you if I have to see it again and he said he would

Best regards
