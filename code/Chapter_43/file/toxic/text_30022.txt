Oh please stop talking nonsense and deceiving the world During my long VERY LONG research I foung NO pictures no reliable sources not anything 
Special gloves LOL First those special space gloves never existed and second this is the first time I hear anything about such thing IF YOU WANT TO TALK SH ADD SOME SOURCES FIRST I am sick of anti Croatian propaganda 
Add the links of the pictures if they exist into the discussion If they are not uploaded upload them outside wikipedia and post a link in here Admins and moderators will decide if those pictures are too terrible to publish or notbut of course those pictures are from you GreaterSerbian imagination arent they
Explain to me why all teh sources published here were judged unreliable Because there arent any reliable sources The sources I see now are laughable and they are not proving anything In fact I am suprised that this article is still standing
Yes maybe I have complexes Serbs like that word 
Fact is I do not hate normal Serbs I hate only xenophobic Serbs spreading lies And Wikipedia is full of them 
Oh yeah I forgot YOU arent Serbsyou are from UK or USA You have Serbian IPs only to deceive racist people  sarcasm
