Prediction Timetable is getting bloated 

Why do you people have to add EVERY FREAKING DETAIL to the list It needs to be kept simple and not as wordy this is a wikipedia article not a damn novel If you wanna know all the details WATCH THE DAMN SHOW  ITS FREE ON GOOGLE VIDEOS The list should only contain the most notable and important details A lot of what is there isnt all that notable  Do we need to know the name of every stupid bridge and building shown collapsing or can we just say  a bunch of bridges and buildings collapsed here and mention ONE OR TWO by name as examples I dont want to get involved in edit wars but I will delete things I believe are overly worded redundant and unnecessary and not to mention just stupid Use common sense before you edit
