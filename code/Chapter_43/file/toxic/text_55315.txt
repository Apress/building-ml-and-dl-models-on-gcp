Hullaballoo Wolfowitz  Does it concern you at all that the reasons you gave for removing the clarifications were completely nonsensical  You even removed it at one point claiming it was in a section it was not even in  Lets just cut to the chase you are a Jewish man with an agenda to keep Jewish interests in illegally obtained land by INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS away from wikipedia pages and the masses as a whole  Right  Regardless at least be accurate if you are going to start attacking someone for selfish reasons so you do not look like an idiot next time with anyone that takes two seconds to look into this  AND PLEASE COMMUNICATE WITH ME DIRECTLY NEXT TIME BEFORE BEING OUTWARDLY HOSTILE AS MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN  Thanks   And have a good day
