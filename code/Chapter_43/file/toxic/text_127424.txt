Im just gonna put this out here 

Im not going to keep arguing with youYoure unreasonable sensitive and narrow minded like the average Wikipedia user The damage has been done you asshat Also we might as well say that every movie has mixed reviews since all movies has positive and negative reviews You dont realize that nothing is equal Everything has a slant no matter how slight and that slant alone has impacted the article via the talk page Tell me when you see whats really important Youre not worth any of my time now

And also if you delete this it will only prove my point Really no use to deleting this message anyway its on another website where the whole world can see it and frankly a few people have agreed with me on said site Just do a quick google search of your username and youll find it Im merely relaying this message to you just to let you know about its existence Have a nice day you asshat6717166108
