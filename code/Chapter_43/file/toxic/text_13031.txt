Ooooh heres our Swiss neutralist And what does this administrator bring to the table this time Lets see accusations of parroting arbitrary classification of users based upon penname preferences strawmen ignoratio elenchi and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously We call that petitio principii dont we Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my penname to something like John Doe How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture Oh thats right he doesnt He probably didnt check my IPaddress to see that Im based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede Whoops Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience

Like I stated before it doesnt matter if Im a Nazi Communist Liberal or even a hippie It doesnt matter if I do drugs or if I look even remotely like a reptile It doesnt matter if Im even an obese Tongan kid It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation This is aptly called speculation

Now I will only say two things First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion Liviusorg is visited by thousands of people daily Along with a number of other scholarrelated websites I cant live without checking it by a daily basis It deserves a Wikiarticle where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as 96 Yes sounds like a plan of revenge The paragon of PanIranic resurgence The removal of a Wikiarticle of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom Howl Howl Our world is forfeit

Second point and I mean this from the bottom of my heart Get laid Your superiorinferior complex isnt convincing anyone here whether they be Iranian or not There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay Thats the bottom line irrespective of any perceived reasoning Either change the article so that it pertains to Liviusorg or stop your incessant whining Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iranfriendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians Maybe thats how you make more drama in your life by arbitrary holierthanthou attitude

Idiot
