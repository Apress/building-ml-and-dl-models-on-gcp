It is very funny to learnthat a stupid fuckin   is trying to clean up the Kamboja articles This person himself is totally disoriented and utterly confused mentallyintellectually and it is also very clear from his comment somewhere else about Kambojrelated articles that he does not even know the very basics of the Kamboj history It is really funny to know how this idiot and his ilk are confusing the Indian journal Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency with  the Handbook of the Bombay Presidency How come these idiots who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical referencescitations be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas It is  also amusing to learn that suchlike dorks are trying to define the historical outlines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia It is highly desirable that these fuckin selfstyled Wikipedia administratorscommentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject It is shameful that these FEW F SELFSTYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS LIKE DABUDABITSMJUDITH and the like are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English Fench or German by their European writers Well if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history It is first necessary that these adminitratorseditors like Fuckn Dabbu and his ilk first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj historyonly then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the KambojkasAnd Ill see how long these ignorant prejudicedminded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia
