Fuck You Bertie

Thank you for taking the time to make your comments The recognition of your Having professionals who contribute their talents at Wikipedia is a great thing and helps advance the project comment is most appreciated and highly agreed upon

Unfortunately the involvement of contributors such as BertieBasset  who should be deprived computer access and is hopefully sterile for the sake of future generations  detracts from the efforts of wellmeaning professionals and truly hinders the betterment of the project through their moronic lack of vision or intelligence and professional or quality editing ability

That being said regrettably it would be best for ALL images to be deleted at this time as per your extended courtesy No further contributions will be made and it will be remembered as a failed attempt to improve a deserving site due to the ignorance of those amateurs like BertieBasset Dannyg3332
