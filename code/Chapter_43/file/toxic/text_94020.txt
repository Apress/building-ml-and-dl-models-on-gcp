Bullshit
This entire article reads like a piece from a travel magazine Wikipedia is not a travel magazine Just because you get a big burrito wrapped in Aluminum foil does not mean you have a San Francisco burrito What kind of horseshitforbrains dumbass would write this article Its a shame too this would be great on the food channel But its nothing but fluff and doesnt belong here The concept of a burrito is the concept of putting things into a tortilla and wrapping it up this is not a San Francisco tradition anymore than the concept of a sandwich is a New York tradition its just something people do Honestly theres a whole fucking paragraph about how important and complex it is to wrap the sucker in aluminum foil This is crap talk
