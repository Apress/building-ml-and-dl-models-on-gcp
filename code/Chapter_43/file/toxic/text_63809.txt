Please do research before making edits

I have reread the history of Trenton Onario page  WHy do you keep changing it back to YOUR edits  Can you say conflict of interest I think you should look at what other users have said about your actions  It appears that you cannot take it when your wrong and someone corrects your mistakes  Stop acting like a child and respect wikipeda  If you want only your view to be heard write a book  Preceding unsigned comment added by 6915765118   

Add to wikipedia

Hi Blotto adrift why dont you start correcting the errors on wikipedia instead of defending your edits  Do you think you know everything  It appears that you do  How about you get a degree and start teaching because then a class will be forced to hear what you say  You will fit in with all those profs who think they know everything but know nothing  Stop acting like a child and grow up
