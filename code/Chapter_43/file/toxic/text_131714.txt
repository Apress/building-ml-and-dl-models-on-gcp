Wikipedia Nazi Germany Phase 2 

Hello I am writing to inform you that Wikipedia is the second phase of the Nazi Germany movement They do not allow any form of freedom of speech and immediately suppress anything they do not like or anything they cannot be bothered to research One could also draw lines that Brookie is very akin to Adolph Hitler in the way that he is evervigilant and despises anyone that is below him in the Wikipedia hierarchy If Brookie or anybody else chooses to delete this then it is proof that Wikipedia does not allow anyone to voice their opinion and will only stregthen the argument that Wikipedia is the second phase of the Nazis plot for world domination
