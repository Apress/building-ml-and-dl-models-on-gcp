blackouts 

Im sorry but this policy of the NFL seems really idiotic like they are punishing the city for not selling their stadium out  Wouldnt that be the prerogative of the team owner Also why havent there been riots over this sort of thing  If my team was playing and the NFL was saying sorry but we a douchebags I wouldnt be surprised to see some kind of mass protest flare up
