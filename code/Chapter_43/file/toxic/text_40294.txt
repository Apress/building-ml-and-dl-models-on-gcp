Neither shows suck Even so comaring TS to KP is like Robt Jones to Teenage Robot  hard desicion

THEY BOTH REALLY SUCK Watch something worthwhile like Family Guy or King of the Hill
That was really mean Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows but so is KP Dont get hostile D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids that doesnt revolve around a cliched loser main character In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends Even Ron doesnt really fit the stereotype Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someones ignorance and stupidity  
Hey wait a second Totally Spies sucks Kim Possible was good but later jumped the shark it then became the worst show ever well not as bad as totally spies or futurama but got close Also as for another comment above Teenage Robot  was AWFUL Robot Jones was way better And as for the final one King of the Hill was great but Family Guy is unfunny It is better than Futurama though FUTURAMA WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING EVER MADE

Dont watch the new KP watch something good like King of the Hill or Shinigan Down
