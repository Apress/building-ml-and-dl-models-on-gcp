As i said before i misread 2000 for 2008 which is why this morning i could not find any refernce at all as i only searched back as far as 2008 You are correct there is a one line entry in our artists directory however You will not find anywhere on our site reference to the best bluesband  etc  moreover the link to the Scott Duncan reference is to be found on the bands own website  jesus talk about self promoting crap  do you not think its odd that interview cannot be found anywhere on our site 8616822664
