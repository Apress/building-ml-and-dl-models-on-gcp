THANK YOU for PAYING ATTENTION

Luckily these morons only know about two celebs I work for and NONE of my clients could care less about wiki  What we all care about is the link to the official site so the option for true and relevant information is available to them  We dont have time to play the wikitroll game   So YES you can see the history of this omnitroll and that username was created JUST for editing those two pages  I expect the user terminated and the connecting profiles to be found and terminated  You can see the moronic trail they left in the history regardless of username  Its all the same trolls

Again we could care less about anything this site offers but if information of my clients is going to be posted the link to the official pages MUST be included

See to it that the links are NEVER removed and you will NEVER see me again  Simple as that

I have several systems to choose from so edits are never an issue  Block my ass and I will still shit on the trolls

Thanks again
