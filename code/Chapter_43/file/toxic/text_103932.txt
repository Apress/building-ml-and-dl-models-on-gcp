TalkLane Splitting

Dennis why dont you just go back and put that article THE WAY I HAD IT  

1 There was an explanation posted along with the change
2 In the United States if something is not specifically prohibited then it is LEGAL

Therefore Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hahn is full of shit Lane splitting is NOT a grey area It is LEGAL as described by the California Department of Motor Vehicles HERE

Motorcycles may travel faster than traffic during congested road conditions and can legally travel in the unused space between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles this is commonly called lane splitting 

So how about you just go back and change your sanctimonious little edit back to the truth  Which is Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hoy is about as ignorant on the subject as Joan Claybrooke  and his stupid uninformed retarded remarks have no place in an encyclopedia   

Thank you
