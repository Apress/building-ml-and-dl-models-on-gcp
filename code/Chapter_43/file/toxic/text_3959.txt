Imagine if I treated Hapfsjen like you treated this anon editor here We both know his English is poor and his comprehension is poor But when I see his messy edits I leave them alone to avoid conflict But you Drmies you treat people like shit Like you I want to delete this article period by period comment in the talk page of an academic and holocaust survivor You dont get to act to like an antisemite and bully people you disagree with and then cry foul when editors point out that you are abusive Your actions speak for themselves You first actions as an admin were to impost your POV on a contentious article And you statement that you dont want to block me is a blatant lie you have said just the opposite in the past and participated in accusations of socking to try and get me blocked indefinitely This is on top of our long running conflict So you lie as much as you want and you can block me if I point out the facts that demonstrate youre a liar but bigotry bullying bias prejudice discrimination and other abuses are wrong Im limited to how much I can speak out about your actions because perversely speaking out against the worst abuses on Wikipedia is punishable But the facts speak for themselves
