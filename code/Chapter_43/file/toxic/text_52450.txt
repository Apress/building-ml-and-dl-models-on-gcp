Wow youre an idiot Heres my imitation of Tao include immature mocking tone I think I know things I think I can get people blocked I think I know rules Provide evidence you guys Oh know theres some evidence my bwain hurts my bwain hurts I forgot how to read waaaaaaaah It is a proposal you fucking idiot It shows youre wrong You refusing to read it does not make you right It just makes you stupid You call it undergraduate as if it lacks validity when you refuse to read it which makes you not only and idiot but a stubborn baseless idiot Block me bitch I fucking beg you Whats taking you so long  

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read
Proposals
1 change phrasing in intro
2 do not change focus of the majority of the page on the close circle
3 perhaps make writers section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart or something quick and simple to read
4 change naming of writers section to something reflected broader scope
5 I would like something like 3  4 to be closer to the top but I do recognize Dooms concern that it weighs down the intro so we can see for now if it works

Im suggesting no change beyond that but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change
