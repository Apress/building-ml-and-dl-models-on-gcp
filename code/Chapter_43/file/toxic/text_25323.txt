not know to this day what
               Devil brought them into our country We did not fetch them
               from Jerusalem Yes we have and hold them captive as I
               would like to keep my rheumatism and all other diseases and
               misfortunes who must wait as a poor servant with money and
               property and everything I have I wish they were in hell
               with the other Jews and whomsoever they would like to have
               with them
