Id love for you to come to the talk page for List of gothic rock bands and describe just why the bands I removed have a place on the page If your answer is Well because some journalist said so then you need to back down Ive been involved in the goth scene but am not at the moment and the MOST irritating thing to goths is when the metal crowd try to budge in and try to normalise the misconception that any form of metal would have anything to do with the gothic rock genre There was a concensus made previously but Blackmetalbaz chose to ignore it and decided to go dictator on the article WHY is someone who SO OBIOUSLY has an agenda of normalising the misconceptions get control over an article when MANY MANY people INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL FUCKING SCENE dont get to edit SHIT Its BULL SHIT Kthx
