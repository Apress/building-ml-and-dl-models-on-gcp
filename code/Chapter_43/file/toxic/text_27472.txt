Sock 

Single purpose actcount created 10 miutes ago knows how to use wikimark up already and how to look legit by writing some random crap on the user page Almost certainly an abusive sock trying to get around 3rr or cause others to do so Checkuser will be enlightening I am quite sure of that   

Crated a user page and wrote someting on the talk page to avaoid red links within one minute then made the edit they wanted to  Almost certainly the scokputter of an established user   

This was just deleted this user knows exactly what he is doing after only 5 minutes His edit was designed to tempt me into violating 3rr and to make it imposible to keep the appropriate tags on the article I think I know who this is Either a sock or meatpuppet of established user who is very involved in editing this article
