Oh my is that any way to address a person on their talk page Did you really just call me an obnoxious little shit You can just imagine what I think of you Well I guess that means the gloves can come off since you started it 

I wonder what exactly you do here on WP It is obvious that you want to be an administrator but you have failed to show the deportment and maturity of mind to make the grade Instead you choose to act like a selfappointed wikipedia police running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others You are a mean spirited very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general highhanded behavior I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid redundant writing that exists here on WP Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up

At a time when WP needs more editors particularly female you with your coarse rude behavior is the last thing WP needs You are to summarize it a net negative  I am amazed that you have not been banned but I suppose your facility at quoting the rules all while completely violating the spirit of WP preserves you This place is a paradise for rulequoters such as yourself  

Sincerly
