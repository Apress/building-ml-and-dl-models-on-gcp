To the psycho calling himself Majeston who has no respect for the real name and meaning of this title and hence is a genetic loser We have viewed your postings and have found you to be unfamiliar and a failure at your understanding of the true ongoings of the Urantia movement The facts are that the Urantia ReadersIntl is a large fast moving and growing organization that stayed with the original Midwayer mandates and the 1950 Doctorine of Trust  that is one reason why we grabbed the torch of the Urantia Brotherhood and still hold it in true light 

The slow failure of the Urantia Book Fellowship has caused many of their misguided believers to join the Urantia Association International and the Urantia ReadersIntl and these are the inside facts which you are not a privy to So little man here are the facts once again reinstated for your reality  if you delete us we delete you Fellowship if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in and keep ours in the we keep yours in if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us we will place our link above you you want a war you got it
