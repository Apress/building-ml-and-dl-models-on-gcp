You are really a stupid fuck if you dont even know your teams history
Yilmaz Gokdel was a real Galatasarayli and he coached galatasaray in the seventies
your list says Gokdel was never coach

thats not corret

Gokdel was succeeded by Don Hawe 
that means that Gokdel started off as coach of the 7475 he even won a Cup with Galatasaray Ataturk Cup
