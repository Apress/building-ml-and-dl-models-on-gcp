What is this drivel

That Hüttenbrenner neither had the work performed nor even let the society know he had the manuscript is curious and has spawned various theories Was he given an incomplete score by Schubert and was waiting for the rest before saying anything If so he waited in vain throughout the six remaining years of Schuberts life After Schuberts premature death in 1828 of typhus as a complication of syphilis why didnt Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose or even inadvertently destroy the last two movements5 Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the works existence for 37 years after Schubert died Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here
