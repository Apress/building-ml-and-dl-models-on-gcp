At the end of the day though you deserve each other If you dont see how the link I provided isnt a BLP violation in the slightest and nearly 24 hours after I posted it you still wanted to call such evidence of basic incompetence as mere allegations then I hope you both take each other down into the depths of merry hell in future because SP must be very emboldened now at seeing what they can acheive with very little knowledge at all by simply crying infront of people like you And as far as that sort of pathetic wikipolitics goes thats at least one thing they do seem to have a learning capacity for Just look at how many new words and phrases theyve learned in that regard just from that one ANI which will no doubt come in handy the next time they fuck up and delete something for being a BLP violation when it isnt or asking for signs of notability for inarticle content or any of the other stupid things he does and repeats because he just wont be told because hes an incompetent Im sure the project will flourish if it selfselects editors who only have that skill while kicking out the ones who do know their arses from their elbows and can actually write content without making a fucking balls up of it at step 1
