I know what sans means smart arse and no you dont explain why that word was there What the fuck does it mean Does it mean all the band but those bracketed were apprehended or the band were left sans which is pretty fucking archaic by the way  pretentious some might say those bracketed If its the former then thats a crap choice of word and doesnt relate to the opening of the paragraph at all  which is about Garcia getting busted If its the latter then it really makes no sense whatsoever
