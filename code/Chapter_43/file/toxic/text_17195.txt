Hi Its from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles Not to mention that both images are good resolutions contrary to what the user says which is why I dont see the need to change images delete galleries and remove content Its unnecessary   
It is nevertheless a content dispute Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism per WikipediaVandalismTypes of vandalism and WikipediaVandalismWhat is not vandalism  Donald Albury 

It was vandalism but not mine  Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least  One of them replaced a photo of a street in the article for that street Brickell Avenue and doesnt even show the street  THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE STREET  Also youre supposed to answer a talk on the same page Yours that it initiated on not put the answer on the initiators page so there are 2 half conversations on two separate pages  I suggest you read a bit more about Wikipedia rules and stop vandalizing articles with your crappy poor lighting amateur photography from car windows  66176139222
