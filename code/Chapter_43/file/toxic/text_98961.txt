Who the hell are you to decide who is notable you ABSOLUTELY UNHEARD OF  BLITHERING NOBODY

You invited me to edit a page and I did so it is NOT DISRUPTION  If you dont want it edited DONT MAKE IT EDITABLE

My notability is verifiable on the Web and off  I cited STARRRING in a  AmericanCanadian film in the very famous  Amityville series and am noted in many places on the Web as its star

I also cited several a major North American newspaper the Montreal Gazette founded by Benjamin Franklin and the largest English language daily west of Toronto  You were also told that I have been a critic for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation but YOU wouldnt know what that is you ignorant AMERICAN WOULD YOU

I ALSO HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER MAJOR CREDITS BUT HAVE NOT LISTED THEM

Obviously you are discriminating against prominent Canadians because you cant be bothered doiong researching outside of the Internet or your own selfimportant ng country  

MY article was DISRUPTED by an editor who admits she herself was cautioned by Wikipedia

Heres some news for you BInky  Wikipedia is so notable it is NOT EVEN LISTED in the Britannica 2007

Heres some more news School children EVERYWHERE are warned of the general unreliability of Wikipedia and so they should be because it is run by wannabe editors like you who cant find editing work outside of the virtual world

Now go collect your unemployment cheque or check for ignorant rabble like yourself and buzz the hell off
