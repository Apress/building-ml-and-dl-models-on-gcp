fuck u communist bastards if u lik the sunflkower on this page go blow urself  It has all the sections clearly labeled and it is easy to read  One small thing would maybe be to have less sections although I do think that for showing so many different aspects of the sunflower you do a good job of keeping it focused  Overall well done probably one of the best I have read  I would say try to simplify it a little bit and are all the pictures relevant to the article

thumb Sunflower 
Id like to propose this image for the sunflower article

Wow thats nice Go ahead and add it to the gallery if thats where youd like it Bold text

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article It doesnt seem to add much to the article Whys every article I look at have some reference to anime

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other liveaction medium Its a part of popular culture thats why The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers

If it is at the end labeled and sufficiently known information why not have it  

 why do sunflowers want to follow the sun 

what do they get out of it is this known guessed by relevant public work I myself would even take a clue here thats I really wanna get info on this Bye and thanks  

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas The absorbed light makes the flowers warmer which attracts more pollinating insects httpwwwblackwellsynergycomdoifull101046j13653040199800336xcookieSet1   May be the sunflowers heliotropism is a rudimentary feature from an alpine past  

 Pizarro 

It says that he cultivated them around 1000 BC but this is impossible because Pizarro didnt even go to the Americas until the 16th century AD

Although the text did not say Pizarro cultivated sunflowers the sentence has been rephrased
