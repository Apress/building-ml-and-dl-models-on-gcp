Reply to vandal Wakkeenah
To all the vandals and so called just administrators the air dates are minor problems the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough as everybody else is reporting the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day is also being reverted this is pure vandalism As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever well if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time some spelling errors might occur but its not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this proof All over internet we have Reeves death explained in detail and possible people involved but over here he is taking everything down the idiotic administratotors are reversing it thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts
