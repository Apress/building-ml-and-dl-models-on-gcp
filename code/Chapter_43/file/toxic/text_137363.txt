1 Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations They are often a good idea and are a requirement for feature article status but it is not a requirement for all articles Furthermore the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources This tag therefore enshrines a particular editors view about style that the article in question should have inline citations in an inappropriate way That point belongs on the talk page not in the article itself Robert AWest Talk
