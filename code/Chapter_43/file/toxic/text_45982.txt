Drama 

I thought we were here to work on an encyclopedia but you just seem to be here to stir up as much drama as possible Less than 100 edits to articles in 25 years yet you have no problem chiming in and rudely making bad situations worse Can you possibly give any justification as to why you are a contributor here Its not to build an encyclopedia is it Why dont you stop wasting real contributors time and just fuck off
