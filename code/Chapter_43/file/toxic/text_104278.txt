ROFLMAO Im trying to edit this page to let you guys know that were sharing this proxy so what you do affects everyone in the building yet apparently its an unconstructive addition and Im not allowed to make it yay for censorship on our own talk page Further were already had some asshat delete the third box to our talk page I really have underestimated how down hill this place has gone so be alert theres some seriously lame basement dwellers with lots of spare time and an ego to polish at your peril Kev

There should be a TemplateAsshat to flag anally retentive nutjobs I went from mod to admin to quitting in the first three years of wikis existence well my claim to fame for this reason so youre preaching to the choir man Also if youre setting this proxy up for abuse you should probably make sure it passes socks tests and doesnt appear to be a proxy a lot of gaming networks b proxies that appear open especially things like B3 et al
