Very interesting but stupid 

Strange and interesting how William Tell and Robin Hood are dismissed as fictional when guys like Yue Fei Jumong and Zhou Tong are accepted as historical despite little real evidence  So someone centuries ago wrote a biographyso what  Thats proof  Few have even heard of these unknown chink archers  7049242137
