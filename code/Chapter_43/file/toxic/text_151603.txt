Guys its just simply me that put there Moldovans Romanians 782 and I was not logged in and dont give quickly the fault on Bonaparte hes gone from longtime now from this bullshit of Wikipedia cause theres no purpose with hypocritic people like you I modified that everybody knows that thats Moldovans and Romanians are the same shit anyhow the census will say it They speak Romanian and not Moldovan how they sustain A Romanian understands perfectly when a Moldovan is speaking its fuckin language called Moldovan and vice versa Moldovans are doing this because they are a gang of betrayers and retarded that dont have idea whats their ancestry Lets be reasonable now even if I think that you people here are too stupid to understand this They were Romanians until 1940 and suddenly they changed of ethnicity because they are an different country than Romania    10 June 2006
