You almost get it and yet somehow you are too stupid to really get it  Fair use has limits as you correctly state and there is no automatic entitlement to use nonfree content in an article or elsewhere on Wikipedia  The first item in the policy on nonfree content which you obviously havent read is this
Nonfree content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose
Please do explain what encyclopaedic purpose you are trying to defend  20121525250
