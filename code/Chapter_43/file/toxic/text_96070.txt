You may do that if you want to and I suggest that you add some more blocking hours because he actually is a cyber clown like yourself There do not exist many MGRs but only one single MGR which with the exception of a few people at the University of Munich and at some other places So how can you grandfather Zens and cyper clown Philosophus  say that it had all the time beem ignored Are you both not quite right in your heads By the way is in the Encyclopaedia Britannica for instance written that these four journals are looked at with suspicion I must say to you Zens that you are an entirely immature boy who even seems not to be aware of the legal relevance of writing about other journals in this degrading style Who do you think you are For any of these journals an editorial staff of some dozens of scientists and physics teachers works and great Zens and Jcobinus Magnus look al all these pursons with suspicion 

I think the first thing you should do here is that you both first formally apologize to the editorsinchief if these four journals

If you dont do it then  fuck off and do not bother me any more with our silly and idiotic questions Everything clear you fools KraMuc 22 June 2006
