For the last time Turkish people ARE NOT WHITE Racially religiously ethnically traditionally and historically they are not european Therefore they are not white Even their DNA does not classify them as a white people They are on asia minor NOT europe Reading back your posts you seem to be stubborn in thinking that middle eastern people are white Why is that Are you turkish or middle eastern I really do not understand why you are so persistant in this matter when it is heavily documented that turks are not white If they were they wouldnt be muslim darkskinned and they would not have gone to war with white christians for over 1200 years
