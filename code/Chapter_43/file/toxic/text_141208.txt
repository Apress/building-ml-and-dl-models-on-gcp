A certain admin will block you if you tell the truth about a certain users dirty tricks But she wont do anything to the user who pulled the dirty tricks She only punishes the victim of the dirty tricks The perpetrator goes scot free Thats Wikipedia justice as practiced by admin pschemp  

Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhois talk page falsely describing my request for help as vandalism in his edit summary Oops Was it uncivil again for me to tell the truth If so then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes because it would be an uncivil personal attack to use words such as lie dishonest vandal thief murderer rapist etc The judge would get too upset by such uncivil comments Come to think of it every time an admin describes a users action as vandalism or a user as a vandal thats an improper personal attack according to pschemps logic If pschemp treats people equally not likely then she better block all the admins who make those personal attacks of describing a particular users behavior as vandalism And she better block Ryulong for using that personal attack against me in his false edit summaries
