I said above dont call people holes in edit summaries it violates our policy against personal attacks If you cant read it thats your fault not ours And I also showed you in that same paragraph how to upload images if you want help you only have to ask Veinor talk to me  

You must be logged in to upload files

So In other words I have to sign up just to add 3 things to 1 entry
