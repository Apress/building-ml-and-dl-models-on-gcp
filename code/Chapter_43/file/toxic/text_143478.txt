I would cite the references that Ive made in bold freakin text but I can neither find nor be hassled to go through all the sites features to venture the references button so I put the chapter number and quotes accordingly in the edit giving you no excuse by any means to go about defiling through them all as though it were your lifes passion IF you find them so troubling move the references Ch 260 for one I made to the references section for crying out loud Dont be undoing edits like some douche seeking to start edit wars with no authority take it from me it makes you look like a cretin honestly
