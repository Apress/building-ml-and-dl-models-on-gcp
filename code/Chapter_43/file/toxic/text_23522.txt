MickMacNee an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour 10 seems to have gone out of line in the last days I dont mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it including myself However I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor His history is rather long so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11 12 13 14 In the discussion on this page about a third user he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him evasion obfuscation interuption and intentional deafness That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong Ive tried to point it out to him 15 but with hindsight given our infected history it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond16 However Im far from alone in having that opinion In the last days several other editors have also commented on his behaviour 17 18 19 20Jeppiz talk 

That block log looks like something out of a Wikihorror storywhy has he not been given long blocks in the past I would go for a longerterm block Ks0stm TCG  
A users block log is not generally an excuse to throw the book at him this looks a bit silly if you ask me a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle and nothing will come of it I cant find a really uncivil comment perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days Off2riorob talk  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions but I do think that one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts like you characterisation of my POV or you are simply trolling either way you are all out of credit here tbh Ive got no idea what crappy papers you read Its up to you if you want to parrot everybodys delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about but it really doesnt are not particularly civil Neither is I have had it with your crap In any case I wont interact with the user again I rather leave Wikipedia As I pointed out Im far from alone in having made these observationsJeppiz talk  
Off2riorob I tried your suggestion in fact I didnt think Id need to try I didnt think Id cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse But sure enough I did and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me I guess if someone keeps an eye on him he cant get too far out of hand Alastairward talk  
It is a bit of a rant he is clearly very upset about the footie and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz he has gone now probably off to bed Im sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me what can I say Off2riorob talk  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided I cannot agree even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuseJeppiz talk  
Nothing routine about it Your behaviour and Alistairs are pretty similar which is why they provoked similar responses eventually If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours I am only too willing to oblige MickMacNee talk  
First of all Alistair and I are not the only editors youve attacked and insulted there are at least Grsz 21 and Kevin McE 22 just in the last few days 
While I have definitely argued with you I have not called you one of the most repugnant editors 23 called your contributions crap24 called you a lying hypocritical cunt 25 or told you to fuck off 26 27 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones youve argued with have behaved in the same way It is not a defense then both should be blocked and its not true either just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it Im getting tired of having that same accusation thrown at me all the time and I take it as
