By the way Montanabw you are effectively retarded I can source everything Im saying Look for the book Pleistocene Mammals of North America By Björn Kurtén and Elaine Anderson just for starters Now that will require that you read something other than a webpage actually you can read part of it online even There are many sources on Equine evolution and taxonomy Im not however going to hand them over to you on a silver platter while you feel unristricted in espousing your own ENTIRELY unverifiable claims Heres a suggestion read something that isnt written by people lobbying for feral horse protection Youll get a lot more truthful information out of it I also dont think it was you that reverted my edit of the Mustang article not that it needed to be there are millions of you thoroughly ignorant goons I was actually looking up sources when I came back and saw it had already been changed and thought Jesus whats the point And once again youve clearly demonstrated that while youre not at all concerned with accuracy you still feel you have a right to comment on issues you know next to nothing about People like YOU who dont care at all about the accuracy should be banned from editing anything God Bless the Internet Oh bringer of Ignorantism
