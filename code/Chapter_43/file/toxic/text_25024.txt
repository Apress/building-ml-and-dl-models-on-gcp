No fuck it I should have known it still wasnt worth trying to work with this site I spend like an hour going through the game to make sure my information is straight and I make an actually passable attempt at writing and all for nothing Just because some random asshole isnt familiar with the subject Yeah like Im really gonna make shit up about how a 1995 wrestling video game is played Wikipedia isnt about truth and adding useful information Its about what a few random jerkoffs may or may not know and if they didnt write it its a lie The saddest part is that people are starting to take this site as a top source instead of REAL encyclopedias
