Reversion of vandalism
You on the sixth of October reverted the edit we made to the articleColumbus Alternative High School as the user  admitadly almost every edit we have ever made has been untter and blatant vandalism however this single edit wasnt we changed Advanced Placement to Advanced Placement Program a minor edit yes but a valid one

This is a meaningless complaint we admit and it would not be unwarranted to ban this account immediately however we find it annoying that you reverted our edit to an edit that had the principles name reading Fucking Retard this has since been reverted

We dont know why were even bothering complaining and feel free to ban us well deserve it eventually but for the sake of the little credibility this shit hole has dont do blind reversions you never know what might be reverted

We have fixed your mistake that will be all
