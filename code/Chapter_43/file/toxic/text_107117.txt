Masturbation

I was wondering if your edits are like a form of literary masturbation for you Im curious have you had any success in your lifetime I can on imagine a jealous perpetually failing loser could possibly be so particularly concerned with what rational people would agree is legitimate content simply because you are affraid of any association whatsoever with commercialism Are you jealous envious or affraid of people who succeed Maybe youd be best to give up your life as a failure and join a commune where you can spend your days feeling as equaly imcompeted as your fellow unsuccessful losers At your commune no one is superior and no one enjoys more success than others therefore you dont have to feel ashamed of your lack of accomplishment Do your edits make you feel important Does your mommy or boyfriend control your life so much that youre only able to feel satisfaction in your life through the edits you demand Enjoy yourself Graemel Im sure youll keep up your crusade like the predictible loser I know you must be Im going to stop further wasting my time with Wikipedia and go continue what I do best  which is to make money Bye bye loser
