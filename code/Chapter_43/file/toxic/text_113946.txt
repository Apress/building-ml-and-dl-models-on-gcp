Napoleon Factor 

This movie is like Napoleon Dynamite The audience loves it even though theres actually nothing to it but clich√©s which literally get the shit beat out of them as do most things in this movie 

To be fair Napoleon Dynamites bullettime scenes were only in how slow the characters thought All of them multiplied together gets an IQ of less than 50

Is this the new style To have something suck so badly saving special effects that people cant help but love it I am going to kill someone this is the new blockbuster style

And before anyone starts trying to find out where I live so they can hunt me down I will reinforce that crochety old man persona with these parting words

Pfeh Bah humbug Hrmph
