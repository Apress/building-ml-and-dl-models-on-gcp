Years after Hansons death will her biographer sit down and include this incident and her reaction Ive written articles on Australian historical figuresfrom the left and the rightand I dont include petty bullshit like this Further point is that it is irrelevant to her entire life and career So many Wikipedia articles arent a proper biography theyre slap from this media article and slap from that media article based on the idea that it was said or done so it must be there irrelevant of how petty or nonnotable it is Its why articles on modernday extremists whatever their creed are so bad because theyre just conduits for media crap ie Something negative was said about the person at hand so it therefore must be slapped in the article this is done under the guise of it being notable but it is in reality just an editor taking an oppourtunity to attack the person at hand

Do not think Im blind I see through the bullshit whether it comes from you or the media I havent moved away from my earlier points because Im sticking to my guns Im merely elaborating on them further in the hope to getting the point across to you and your comrades

Nice try at baiting me though  talk
