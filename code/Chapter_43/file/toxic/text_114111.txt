So you believe ALL facts belong in the article Including what bush had for breakfast last thursday or what the wing speed of a hummingbird is What a moron  

Are you serious  The wing speed of a hummingbird has NOTHING to do with George Bush  The fact taht you said that is pure idiocy  Also what Bush has for breakfastremember we start names with UPPER CASE has nothing to do with anything  However a quote that he made in a public speech with the American people is VERY relevant   

You clearly have no brain  Are you GWs friend or something
