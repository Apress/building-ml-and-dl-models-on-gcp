Blocked 

I was blocked by you after a sock puppet person using 3 accounts kept making obvious vandilism changes to an article
They called it blanking a page after I edited out all the crap they had put onto the page

For some reason none you never even looked at anything on the affected page or talked to anyone about the problem nor did you ever even try to talk to me you just ban away It has been KNOWN for a very LONG time that the user Gwernol is a sock puppet

Jimbo himself edited the article and told people to only populate the article with FACTUAL items

The article had been being picked on by several editors sockpuppets all matching Gwernols ip address

I removed everything Gwernol had written and he comes to you to attempt to block me and without even TALKING to me you blocked me

Congradulations on failing the Wikipedia Administration test I believe you will be removed within the next few days as a Wikipedia Administrator by Jimbo himself we have been discussing your actions over the last 24 hours

BTW Id like you to know your block had no effect on me whatsoever
We have a long and true way to deal with rogue Admins and Moderators
