Erik for crying out loud You legally can have sex with children but not with underage children Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent different states have 14 15 16 17 or 18 as the underage limit Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18 In Ireland for example a child aged 17 is over the age of consent In Britain it is 16 Do you know the first thing about the topic 

The name is standard english asage Scandal is a POV term Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church 

Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children so stop adding in an irrelevant topic 

Your mucking around lost a lot of changes spelling corrections and other problems solved I was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job I then tried to go in to your version to transfer over accurate changes but then you started this insane fucking around with the articles location using a POV title I will keep moving back to a carefully worded neutral title  2218 9 Aug 2003 UTC
