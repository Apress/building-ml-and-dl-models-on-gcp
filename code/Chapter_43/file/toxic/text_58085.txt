The article stinks I have said so It has been written from an extreme and disputable point of view from two sources which share it on a subject on which there are innumerable sources of other points of view it contains statements which can only be explained as partisanship or ignorance   That is not uncivil it is a defense  and the only defense  against Wikipedia being  publicly embarassed 

It would be regrettable if your involvement in the same Wikiproject or the same nationality were to create a cabal to defend bad work  PMAnderson
