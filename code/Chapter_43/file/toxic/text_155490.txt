Perhaps if you would quit removing comments from the Talk Page of WWE Undisputed Championship because you disagree with them  You give false claims of vandalism yet there is none per Wikipedia definition I only place the remarks back in that you delete  In point of fact YOUR removal of the comments is vandalism as Wikipedia defines the definition  I do have a beef with you yes I admit it  I dislike you Youre a douchebag  But I am not attacking you as Curps has defined it when I place the comments back in  I am merely taking care of business in regards to that talk page  Wikipedia user  has told you about this  has even told you about this but yet you continue to not listen to anyone  This is not even an isolated incident  you have done this to recsportprowrestling on at least five occassions If you do not like me posting or have a problem with what I place in then either put it on the talk page of whatever account or IP I am using or stop whining and shut up Your pathetic kindergartenlike tactics of running to Curps everytime I do something you dont like is just fucking sad  2028
