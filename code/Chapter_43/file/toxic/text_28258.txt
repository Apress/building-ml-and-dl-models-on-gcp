Good Faith Bad Faith 

I assume good faith It seems simply an act of confusion 

Why would you assume good faith with this person but not with me   
You dismiss my perspective as nonsense and bullshit and a cursory browsing of your Talk page reveals this is a somewhat common response on your part to DisagreementViolations of WP Tenants certainly as bad as those you cast at this newbie

My initial comment that this is frivolous was not meant to imply a bad faith MfD on your part although I did consider it at first The policy on userpages nor much of anything on this site is written in stoneI do not endorse your citation nor do I agree with its application I consider this a frivolous and suprisingly devisive issue 

I wonder regardless of where this vote goes whether the world will be a better place afterwards Obviously you think so but from an airplanes perspective I see a tiny little person defending like hell everyone from a Username that hasnt offended anybody
