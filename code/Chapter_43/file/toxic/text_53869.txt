ARE YOU ILLITERATE That is an honest and topical question

You reversed my edit to the CANARIE page with some inane comment about havent we done something before we havent and the page is missing valuable information I could post their routing table but that is public information available on LookingGlass

If you look up my IP address you should be able to guess that someone with a DNS name of ccacornwdsmunca might know something authoritative about wwwacornnlca I should not have to log in to wikipedia every time I find something missing that I have a correction for at my fingertips I happen to know the web page addresses of most or all of the ORAN affiliates of CANARIE 

Go away and police some spam or porn or neoconservative tripe
