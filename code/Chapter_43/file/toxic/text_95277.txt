You dont really have any friends do you Daniel  I suspect you missed out on being a prefect at school because noone liked you or paid attention to you so you are compensating for that now  Pity Because its people such as you who devalue sites like these For your information parents who look at school entries on Wikipedia want a wartsandall insight into where they send their kids not a glossedover promotion  We WANT to know what pranks their kids got up to in the past and make OUR OWN conclusions NOT to have smallminded  maggots like you determine that for us   

Freedom of information is NOT freedom FROM information

You might quote WPRS WPSOCK  but you fail to note other guidelines such as WPNOTPROMOTION  WPCENSOR WPBURO WPNOTBATTLEETC  You obviously have nothing better to do with your time than to play hall monitor so Ill leave you to your little controlfreak existence I can only thank god that my kids have left school and are out of reach of your nasty little mind
