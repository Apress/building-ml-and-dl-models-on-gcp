listen casp clearly you do not have the ability to distinguish between a threat and a comment I said IF this was the USA I would have sued you by now That is a hypothetical situation If I wanted to threaten you  I would have saidIm gonna sue your ass

Do you see the difference its subtle i know but even the likes of you should have enough knowledge of the english language to make that distinction
