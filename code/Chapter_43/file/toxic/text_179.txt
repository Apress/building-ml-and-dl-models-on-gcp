That was me loser The UN defines Vietnam to be part of Southeast Asia And far as I know Vietnam is part of ASEAN and used to be part of French Indochina with Laos and all those shit countries Anyway your culture has always been more influenced by SEA than Han Chinese as in proper Yangtze Han Chinese not the fringe indigenous tribes in GuangzhouGuangxi 

Just admit that you vietnamese are all a bunch of wannabe crap people ALL the east asian people Ive spoken to thinks of Vietnam as a very integral part of SEA and we all think youre backward dirty and speak in a horrible swearing language Doesnt matter what crap you spout on Wikipedia wont change the way people in the real world think
