Still Here Fatass 

What is it like waking up every morning looking at the mirror observing girls cross the street at your approach who laugh as you attempt to waddle down the street What is it like to see sexy women recoil in horrer at your approach What is it like to eat 15 chocolate bars in one sitting What is it like to be dangerously obese What is it like to be an obtuse dick along with all of that who does counter productive things even though a bit of common sense 16 months ago would have saved him all this hastle What is it like being THAT obtuse

EDIT Perhaps you should consider a dialogue All this reverting is so obtuse its silly Ive said it before all you need to do is offer a recognition in an edit summary THAT I FUCKING EXIST YOU FUCKING MORON and I WILL GO AWAY FOR EVER MORON
