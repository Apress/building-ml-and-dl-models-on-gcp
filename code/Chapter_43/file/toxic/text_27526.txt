No someone buggered it all up with those STUPID redirections

The players name is WALTER GORDON NEILSON not Gordon Neilson 

and Willie NEILSON what a crock of sh  I thought nicknames were extra their proper names should never be overuledredirected

and his brother is ROBERT THOMSON NEILSON not Robert Neilson

I am gonna get all those redirections reversed and get those biographies rewritten correctly
