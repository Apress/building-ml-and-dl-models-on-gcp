No sir this comment is disgusting  You offer not one scintilla of evidence for the claims you make nor do you site one example of factual error in the article  All you have to offer are your recycled opinions about the Irish Republican movement  You have nothing new or even interesting to say  I always love it when armchair opponents of the IRA jump up on their high horse and begin pontificating because almost without exception they say something like this Whatever the crimes of the British government as though it is reasonable and proper to dismiss 800 years of oppression murder starvation and constant meddling on the part of the Brits so that one may then attack the excesses of the Republicans who have been fighting to kick the Brits out  Lets see 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits vs the just over 80 years that the IRA has existed and you in all of your wisdom decide that the RA is worse  Go pound your chest elsewhere
