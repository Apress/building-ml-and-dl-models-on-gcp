Hahaha wow that is the stupidest thing Ive ever read What the heck was the simulation based on  Do you believe everything you read  Haha it looks like you do You are an idiot if you believe that and it ignores evidence that proves humans evolved over 100000 years ago How could a European and Australian Aborigine have a recent common ancestor in that time frame if its already known that those people have been isolated in Australia for at least 30000 years  I hope you are joking about this you loser haha
