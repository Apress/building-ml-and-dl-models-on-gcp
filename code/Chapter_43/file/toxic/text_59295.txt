I protected the pages against your very poor editing which is understandable as youre new here

My editing was not poor as anyone can see it for himherself But let us take you for your word You protected the page against my poor editing which is understandable because I am new here Oh really Can you show me where in the rules of Wikipedia says protect a page against a newcomer if his editing is poor Who decided my editing is poor You Based on what Based on your religious fervor There was nothing wrong with my style that would contravene the standards of Wikipedia It was the content of what I wrote that you could not stand You keep justifying your biased action against me hiding behind the rules and fail each and every time to say exactly which rules I broke There is no rule that I broke You know that That is why you constantly act like a mommy talking to a child if you behave good we will let you play Be specific Ms SlimVirgin I can show the rules that you broke Can you show me the rules that I broke Can you be specific for once Why not apologize and demonstrate that you can also be a great person 

Secondly the suggestions I left on the talk pages actually favored your view to a large extent 

Are you trying to insult my intelligence 

So you are Indonesian the same country MENJ comes from and all those death threats were issued against Ali Sina that you could not tolerate Well it is difficult to see the nationality of a person through the Internet However it is not that difficult to see the bias In fact most Iranians are now anti Islamists I guess they had enough of Islam 

You did enough of lecturing Ms SlimVirgin about how I should apply the rules of Wikipedia I read those rules before making my first contribution You should read it again to refresh your memory I have accused you of being biased against me and have proven it There is also a complaint against you by someone else So I am not the only one receiving you sting Instead of lecturing me why dont you answer my charges These lecturings are smoke screens behind which you try to hide your own sins
