Hi nerd 

Would you please explain why what I wrote is disruptive but Akbar is also the AI Personality of India in the renowned game Age of Empires III The Asian Dynasties

Are you gonna tell me that Age of Empires III is more culturally relevant than Matt Groening 

Or this

In Kunal Basus The Miniaturist the story revolves around a young painter during Akbars time who paints his own version of the Akbarnama

None of that is cited it is much less relevant than Akbar and Jeff is How do I insert the Akbar and Jeff reference without getting a million angry nerds on my ass
