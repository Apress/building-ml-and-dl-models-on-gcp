Fck off the fact is i dont wanna be on a site where the so called admin have no knowledge of topics which they edit You said i blanked page those pages have CITATION TAGS for 24 years Those articles are not verfiable from any other source or book or on net Instead of deleting such pages you made it an ego clash That i am an admin and i can do whatever i like Otherwise you still have not posted a valid reason that why should those Articles not be deleted You got angry as i exposed your poor knowledge but this is a fact that Britains time is over and so is yours Be happy with your wikipedia and your privileges as an admin and keep forcing your thoughts on other by using your power as admin and in the similar fashion such articles will bring more and more CREDIBILITY to wikipedia and to admin Keep your site and your pages  the thing which exposed once again that how Britain is a coward country britain dont ruled Hindu by force but by dividing Hindu into caste and making their regiments otherwise we Hindu would have taught you the same lesson which we taught to Muslims and Mughal Empire and to Durrani Empire and to 500 Million muslims of indiapakistanbangladesh and afghanistan

hope to never see a sore loser like you and neither this site who have entrusted responsibility on people like you what you want to portray by defending those two articles The reality is that no TRUE WIKIPEDIA ADMIN will allow those articles without any citation for years to be on wikipedia but you want those two articles not because those ARTICLES ARE GREAT but because of your EGO which i exposed that people like you never accept mistake Who dont have courage to accept their mistake instead rant about english grammar and all that I dont need english  i am a hindu my language is hindi even if i can speak 10 of english i am more brilliant than you as you filthy scum cant speak even 1 of hindi
