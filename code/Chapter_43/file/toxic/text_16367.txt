Vandalism Sorry mister but I havent conducted vandalism a single time and ALL of my edits so far notify me if any of them are not contributive or factually correct are legit edits Fuck off was because of the overwhelming amount of obvious facts being asked for citation and was NOT meant for ANY specific user Is Wikipedia this full of bull and Im using a euphenism because Im sure youll refer to assume good faith as soon as you see me using my own rhetoric Im bothered by bull so Im just here nicely removing and being bold about editors screwing up badly Ironically I could write some edit summary to this edit like fuck things sure are fucked up pretty fuckily around fucky here regarding the dumb in the fact that I had not attacked ANYONE SPECIFICALLY Give me one evidence where I had mentioned a person or a revision Oops theres none This is the bull Im talking about Please there are better things to worry than to ban some people because of some behind the scene metadata with a little cuss and a preposite Hint the fuck off was towards the MANNERS and the piece of  template not ANY person or any group of editors Tell me why all my effort in writing good articles using proper punctuation and spelling and using a Wikipedialike style is overseen by admins who only look at some edit summaries who nobody really cares about  talk
