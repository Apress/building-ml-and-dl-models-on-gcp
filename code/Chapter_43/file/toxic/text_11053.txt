Too funny

corey suggests a famous people section from moline or historical signicance section but that is just too funny  These guys will probably tell you about some confederate hero or plantation owner or other backwood gomer  What do you call a person from Moline who has all their teeth  An obvious nogood noaccount yankee LIAR who just rode in  Hmmm not a very funny joke but then again racism isnt funny either and this page is completely racist  Backward ignorant hillbilly heehaw and racist
