WTF Banned 

Some person in a fourm said it is banned in Syria do to the closeness of the names AlAsad and AlAssad The correct form is Al Asad in the game I said he was wrong and he went crazy saying some dumb stuff that I was stupid Who is right cause I could find No Source that confirmed his statement that this game is banned in Syria Asad and Assad are very common middle eastern names anyway 7213821689
