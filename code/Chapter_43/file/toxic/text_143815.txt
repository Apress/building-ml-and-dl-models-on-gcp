Excuse me for coming on hard but the thought of going through this crap again displeases me Quoting Rushton is equivalent to using Ann Coulter as a prominent reference in the Kwanzaa article or if you still do not get the point allowing a well educated klan member on the basis that the concerned klan member is wellknown to claim that niggers are monkeys What is the difference Should every stupid opinion be included merely for the sake of balance Perhaps yes but there are or should be limits What annoys me most is that Kobrakid and company probably do not intend it but succeed so well in disrupting this article
