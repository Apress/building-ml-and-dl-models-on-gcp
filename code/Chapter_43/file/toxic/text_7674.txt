My Statement 

Oh wow I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone I guess I can take on each point

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd also if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying what do you really expect
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion I was told multiple times to fuck off btw when told to fuck off I am considerably less likely to comply
  They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network That being said rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki he hasnt gotten over it I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry
 UserGeorgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings A vandal can be warned four times but a user once Hmmmm
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped He had every right to block for a violation of WPNPA tens of times
