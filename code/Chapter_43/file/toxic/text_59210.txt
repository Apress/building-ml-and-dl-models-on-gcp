User Jkelly is incapable of behaving responsibly and has removed the correct edit of another user THe LIES AND FALSEHOODS being pished through on the Greek pages are a disgrace and show that Greeks are not fit to be members of the European Union THe correct data from the 2001 Census and official reports have been put on these pages by me and others time and again and Greek nationalists have decided to remove them So once again THERE ARE NOT 98 GREEKS IN GREECE SO STOP THE CRAP I have tired of putting links to official reports when idiots here remove them Just grow up and learn how to make correct arguments instead of the childish GREEKS ARE WONDERFUL AND CLEVER mentality
