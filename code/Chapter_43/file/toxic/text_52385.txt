You guys are of the opinion that if things do not go YOUR way your response is Well fuck those guys I dont care what they think  You guys take yourselves way to seriously in my opinion  If someone disagrees with your decision to on an edit then you block them or ban them  Some jerk whom I cant remember not you two guys even has some kind of graph on his talk page showing how many times his talk page has been vandalized like that is something to be proud of  Such a meter is really a measure of just how much the community hates you and what an asshole you must be  That makes about as much sense as saying Ive had my front windows busted out 50 times this week  That must mean Im doing something  No  It does not  That just means that at least 50 were super angry enough at you to take time out of their day to go mess you up  How many more equally hate you but just dont want to take the time to toss a brick through your window  talk page

Millions of people come here each day and you guys think that a consensus one or two or three other editors agreeing with you on something  And how do you know that those three other consensus makers arent just as stupid as you are 3 or 4 out of 100s of thousands of editors

Your standards and ideas as to how things are done are not the same as mine  And it certainly does not mean that yours are any better than mine  Bot yalls minds are too closed to realize that  Whatever  Ive said my piece
