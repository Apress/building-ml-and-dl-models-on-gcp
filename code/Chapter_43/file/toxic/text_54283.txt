I am not aware of wikipedia guidelines regarding poopie pants though Im pretty sure there is at least implicit consensus that having them is not good  I am also pretty sure that somehow your pants physically spiritually or metaphorically are full of poop The only reason that you consider comments like this to be personal attacks is because your pants are so woefully full of poop in one of the aforementioned modalities  Your contributions to  Benzodiazepines and poop which may lead you to pages with information useful for removing it from your pants Youre not the boss of me
