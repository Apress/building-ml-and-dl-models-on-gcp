Gotcha 

An artist who likes using the names of his creations as his pseudonymns

Every night at the stroke of midnight the master turns into a screaming maniacal demonic raging bloodlusting animal

And then I get mean Vincent Price

You think its funny Actually its sadbut thats a concept not part of your brainthats EVEN MORE SAD

Your drawings look like those of an underdeveloped mind like from a child It perfectly fits And I also love your friends for having great realism implanted in their small brains httpwwworionsarmcom ZERO ideas just describing the real world thats creative undershit hahahahaha

You my dear friend are genetic crap and you know it Beside that I know 7 billions that would love to kill asses like you Go home and never come backwe wont miss you Noooo there is no real love for you you took the wrong junction at the last galaxy voidhead

So now go fuck your inborn BLINDERS in front of your head thanks 17819722926
