The users final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary fuck it  The page blanking was reverted because of an active block  The block is no longer active the user has not returned to Wikipedia and I think it is pretty clear that fuck it is the equivalent of I am retiring from Wikipedia  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they dont want to come back to Wikipedia and that they dont want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity that is within their rights
Also I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page hmmm  While WPDRC is merely a guideline there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page eg warnings 24 hours old and active block notices but as it currently stands there is no such policy at least not that I can find  If I am wrong please enlighten me
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb then so does everybody else  In fact that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant  I disagree with the rules but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place  And by my interpretation of the current rules Karakus blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted  
Furthermore while I recognize that I was using the word VANISH imprecisely it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing they have the right to do that  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying Retired at the top of your Talk page vs blanking the thing with the edit summary fuck it
Anyway Im obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired users talk page  Im just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesnt want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes
