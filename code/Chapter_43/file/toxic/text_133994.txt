What they say about Wikipedia is right Its a mob mentality I dont give a shit about your rules I do what is right What is right is making the edits that correct infactual information You dont think Im justified in getting pissed off because some jerk kept reverting 100 VALID EDITS Seriously wikipedia you are full of yourself Etiquette Secondary Primary goal is to get articles right and I did that You are idiots for blocking me but not blocking the editor who kept reverting to infactual information
