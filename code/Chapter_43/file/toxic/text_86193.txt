DeCausa your pissing me off First of all I have provided many different sources I didnt just use Kurdistanica Anytime I used a source you basically said that It was unacceptable which is false You just wanted to deny it because you felt like it How do I know Because you did the same with the sources on the Kurdish language Almost all sources regard Kurdish language as one but you decided to use 4 source 3 that are actually relevant that say otherwise What does that tell you Do you think I was born yesterday Oh and by the way I wasnt talking about my proposal I was taking about the propsal above mine Right now there are more people that are supporting the lift of the term Iranian on Kurds but I see no changes With my propsal however you did not let anybody to look at it As soon as I posted it up you decided to be a douchebag and just write all nonsense below it before anyone could even say yes I agree or disagree

I suggest you dont talk to me again I dont like when people are biased and rude
