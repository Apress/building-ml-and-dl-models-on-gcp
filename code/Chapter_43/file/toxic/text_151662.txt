That doesnt seem plausible to me  You certainly seemed to get past the edit conflicts when you deleted my comments on your Talk page without responding to them  I wanted to have a civil discussion but you were making it impossible to do so by not replying to my questions  If you didnt ignore and then delete valid questions you might get called a jerk less often
