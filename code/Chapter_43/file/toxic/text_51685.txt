Dont worry I see that civility is more important to patrollers than actual logical discussion and debate of controversial issues which I attempted to engage in for months finally becoming exasperated when I received no help from other editors against a wall of Nazi sympathisers Patrollers apparently outnumber those prepared to engage in difficult debates Having been convinced that Wikipedia isnt worth editing and the freedom of the encyclopedia depends only on how many hours a day someone can devote to fighting with Nazis you can consider my flameout final and my disillusionment complete You and the Nazis have patrolled a good faith editor out of the system and I am fully aware that the main tactic is to grind down good faith newcomers until they flameout Well fuck this
