What the  is this  

Wikipedia has reached an all new low Why in the  is Platinum reserved as a sub section now with only two paragraphs about it Are you people that damn formal that you have to follow every f ucking rule to the teeth This is an outrage  

Do you have any suggestions for improvement or are you just ranting 2008  

 Oh I see Wikipedia gets to shit in our Wheaties with these policies yet you guyds get free reign to bastardize articles to your liking Oh I know why not combine ALL pokemon games onto one page Oh yeah that reaaallly helps out doesnt it
