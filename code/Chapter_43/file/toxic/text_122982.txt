What is it youre saying
That if you get attacked by another poster you just should accept it Because if you object youre just making trouble Is that it if youre being stalked just accept it

Or how about admins That posters here just have to accept whatever arbitrary action an admin makes That is an admin is wrong you just have to suck it up Is that what this system stands for Is that what youre saying In wikipedia you have to accept the arbitrary actions of unaccountable admins Thats all you have to say thatll end it Id have no recourse

Look you dont want problems when you log into wikipedia I dont want problems when I post here But when an admin makes a wild mistake and then hides instead of addressing it I dont see how I cannot try to seek appropriate redress 

His content was wrong His arbitrary action was wrong I dont care about his character
