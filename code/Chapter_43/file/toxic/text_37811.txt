Okay with regards to that last little comment How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant nay to an immature little boy despite your years oh and so many of them there are Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you cant verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be And what of those whose revisions youve mindlessly reverted you dispatch to them on mass pseudoendearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above I will admit to you that I have committed much wikivandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am If you can recall Of this there is little hope you once likened my writing to that found in chatrooms and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical angry way not only have I graduated I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine and had convinced the Fuehrer my editor to publish an article I wrote on Rush It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet So Thank YOU Anger22 It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be Thank for your tireless efforts Thank for your senseless heartless worthless and above all tireless efforts I really do hate you
