Administrators are Elitist Bastards I dont care what anyone says the vast majority of administrators are pompous overbearing control freaks They run around with this attitude that having sysop is some sort of right priviledge or a permission to bully harras and generally act like a dick thinking they can get away with it There IS a cabal and it makes sneaky backdoor decisions such as deletions vote stacking blocks trying to force editors into 3RR page protections et cetera almost daily
 It would seem Im not the only person that thinks most admins are total Fuckwits with an attitude problem I have been blocked for no reason whatsoever because some dickhead feels he can abuse his power
