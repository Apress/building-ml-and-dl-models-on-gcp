I Should be Surprised

But Im not Its exactly the kind of spineless response I anticipated from you Look Schumin I dont care about you remotely Im not here to bring you some sort of pain I dont care anything at all about you What I do care about and care about deeply is that the number onestop shop for knowledge on the internet is even fractionally run by someone like you This is a serious project and attitudes like yours arent needed You are one of these people who wouldnt last a day on a serious academic venture but sleazed your way onto Wikipedia and whored yourself as an admin For you being an admin is not the gruelling work it should be its a status symbol And thats sad Thats really sad

Now confront this head on for once in your life Maybe your mother told you to ignore problems and they go away I think you should confront your problem and apologise for your actions 8645202183
