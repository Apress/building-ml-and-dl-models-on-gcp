Never going to happen so you might as well give up on that tidbit and again I stand by what I say  At the time you left the comment he had gone to bed  That doesnt give you the right to be an absolute jerk to him and insult him just because he didnt respond instantly  As to why he hasnt responded further that is quite obvious he already explained to you his reasoning  He does not have to defend himself to you and you are the only person who thinks he is abusive  I dont expect you to apologize but know this if you continue on the path you are on now you will get blocked dÎ±lus Contribs 
You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection  My objection was NOT that he didnt respond in 8 hours or anything like that  You portrayed that as my objection though  Instead I objected that Dodo wasnt addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS  Other than his driveby deletions and a template or two he DIDNT respond to my complaints  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day as you implied my original complaint was he didnt even EVENTUALLY address my objections  Irresponsibly and probably maliciously you tried to make me look like the bad guy for objecting to Dodos repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus etc
Dodo was trying to act on the theory if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits without waiting for any sort of consensus etc  Evidently that is your position as well  I say No  Dodo never in detail responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior  Is the reason that he is busy  Well if hes SO BUSY 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts  Doesnt make sense does it  The answer is quite simple  Dodo and I suspect many other selfappointed InfoNazis ALWAYS have time to slap down other users thats EASY and takes little time but they DONT have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged  Dodo and many others amount to semiprofessional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others use of WP  Stop it
