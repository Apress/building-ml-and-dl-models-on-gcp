you are the one who has to stop making racial  comments and  treat other people like equal and stop implying that that European race is any better than the others I am not European myself and I dont care which country is in or out by the way that does not depend on you wikipedia is the only place were yoursamll brain can express itself just like many other unknowlagable people in here there is no need for someone to try to make someone LOOK like anything  else than what they are  they probably would not even claim to be european if they knew that they would be somehow associated with a fascist like you maybe all those people have to die their hair platinum blonde for you to like them
