Dcokeman while you preach to us from up high on what neutrality means you need to take a lesson in civility  
Stop throwing out lame definitions from websters dictionary to prove your point maybe assume we know a little bit about the english language
Stop preaching to us what neutrality means like a father talks to a child just make your point about why something is neutral or not without defining neutrality for us everytime  Assume were maybe quite possibly smarter than monkeys
Dont shout theres no reason why you need to shove your opinion down our throats 1640 July 13 2005 UTC
