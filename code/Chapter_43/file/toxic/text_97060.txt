Crappy organization
People should be listed by era in which they acted not when they were born  If not then at least find a better way to organize them as by birth date is confusing and somewhat irrelevent  If youre going to stick with this particular categorial method then at least headline it like born in the 1980s rather then 1980s which confused me right off
