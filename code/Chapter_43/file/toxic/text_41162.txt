Hey  Kuru 

There is  something really wrong with the administration of Wikipedia and I am not the only one to know about and complains

For quite a while I had been hesitant but after a comment by a Polish Wikipedian I was finally encouraged to leave Polish Wikipedia for some time only perhaps I decided to move to the English Wikipedia for a change

Regards
Kpjas talk 

Although I am aware that  he Kpjas  have his  own problems for some it might be a positive development

I want to remind you that in US  at one time they needed to block the IP of US gov  because  the politicians were polishing their resumes and were using the Wikipedia as they election platform

You Have responded to  my  comments in a way positively

The problem is still that bunch of  administrators have  NO idea what the hell they  are talking about

Please read my comments  and make  appropriate  corrections as  a shoddy  communist agents tabloid operating the disinformation campaign shall NEVER  be called  a prominent newspaper
You do not call a clochard a prince and prince a clochard
There is to much crap like this specially  related to abuse by the polish administrators  who are  either  connected with the propaganda machine or are brain washed 

As  an expert on many issues I believe that all  IPs  of some bloody idiots from  Poland should be banned for all other languages so we will have the real and unbiased by the people who do not understand what is Freedom Liberty and Democracy and  vandalize the web pages with their totalitarian communist bias after being brain washed   since 1945 by several decades from generation to generation and educated by the communist teachers

By  reading the crap on the PL  Wikipedia  some sections of it specially connected to the history politics and resumes of politicians  should be completely taken off air  once and for ever
Thanks
