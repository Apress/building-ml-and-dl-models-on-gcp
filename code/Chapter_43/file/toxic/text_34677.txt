Rock critics are morons Everyone knows that However there is no reason to be ashamed here especially when the statement is followed by evidence for record sales of 300 million albums and proof that Queen is outselling The Beatles in the UK Everyone reading it going to see right away that the critics who like idiotic garage bands that only know three chords must be wrong At the same time it is important that this page does not read too much like a fan page That is why that portion of the sentence is there Feel free to make it sound less harsh though
