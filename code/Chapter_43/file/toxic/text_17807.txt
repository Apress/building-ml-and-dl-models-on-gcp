Disgusting
This guy is a disgusting sex columnist He revels in it He does it on purpose and its what gives him and his column their edge It seperates him from every other sex advice giver Ive ever read  and its his signature attitude tone and approach to the issues But there seems to be no way to adduce this highly pertinent and relevant information without violating the lame loose sloppy illthoughtout NPOV rule Hilariously and disgustingly people tell me providing this information violates article neutrality Any help here by any person of quality integrity and intelligence would be appreciated
