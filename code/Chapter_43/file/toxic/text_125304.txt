Swedish joke 1 

Since selfrighteous Mrchoppers knows nothing about the USDM D15B8 which he relentlessly involves himself with there will be a new Swedish joke each time the foreign national sabotages an entry made on an engine which he is clueless

A Swede was walking down the sidewalk carrying a dog in his arms
A passerby stopped and asked Where did you get that monkey
The Swede replied Its not a monkey
Shut up Swede I was talking to the dog
