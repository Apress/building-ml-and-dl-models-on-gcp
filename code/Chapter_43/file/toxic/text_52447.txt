You are not worth the effort You are arguing like Viriditas and Pename now 24 hours really means 24 and a half hours Four reverts in more than 24 hours is violating the spirit of the three revert in 24 hour rule  as interpreted by you So tough Who needs rules Just make it up as you go along and do what you want  call it discretion You violate the rules by blocking me then claim I violated the spirit of the rule  Your violation is debatable like the Occupied Territories are disputed You are just abusing your authority to push your petty authoritarian agenda that obviously reflects your personal insecurities You think you can threaten and bully me  And I guess you wont be reverting so quickly in future will you now What a weasel Please go ahead and contribute your petty complaints to ban me so I dont bother wasting my time on a project populated by immature arrogant twerps fascist Zionist bigots Islamophobe hatemongers bunch of lameass bigots and losers Why waste my time   0748 12 Dec 2004 UTC
