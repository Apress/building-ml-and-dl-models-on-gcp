The day I got served 

Well since you didnt seem to agree with my statement about MCMAP Im going to expose you for what you are a POG  The day I get corrected by a POG is a sad day in the world of the Marine Corps  Dont be offended because I speak the truth about the Marine Corps and the lies that recruiters feed you  Come spend a day with me in a grunt battalion and well see how your outlook on your beloved Marine Corps will change  And way to go a corporal still after 6 years in and youre a POG  Way to go  I guess you didnt do your MCIs so you could pick up or suck enough of your first sergeants cock  Youre a dildo  Congratulations on signing up during a time of war just to edit articles about the Marine Corps on wikipedia  Pretty bitch move if you ask me
