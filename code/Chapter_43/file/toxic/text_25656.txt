Why do Jews get their own special term for discrimination against them Black people dont have antiebonism native Americans dont have antinativism and Arabs dont have antiarabism Actually since Arabs are Semites antisemitism is directed at them as well The only thing this proves is that Jews think theyre special and exclusive and should get special treatment even though many ethnoreligious groups have suffered to the same or greater extent only the JEWS should get a special name for their type off suffering Pretentious bastards
