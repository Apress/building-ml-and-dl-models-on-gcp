I dont find your unedits a genderbased attack  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit  Surely it cant mean that much to you

I dont want to make derogatory comments about men  I have nothing against men and I dont enjoy tearing people down  You mention the term wellreferenced  I prefer for statements to be wellreferenced too  I dont think that this particular statment is wellreferenced and furthermore I dont think that it can be wellreferenced because I dont think that it is true  And so I wonder about the authors neutrality  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and welledited and that statement is neither

I dont want the article to be deleted either  I think that it serves a useful purpose and I enjoyed reading it  I just want to do away with that particular sentence

Of course if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts then we have no problem at all  But Im pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth

Cheers
