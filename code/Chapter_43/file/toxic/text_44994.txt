SANDAHL YOU HAVE LABELLED ME AS A VANDAL WITHOUT ANY WARNING  THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO STATED WIKIPEDIA POLICY AND I AM CONSIDERING TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST WIKIPEDIA AND YOU PERSONALLY AS WELL AS CIVIL LIBEL CLAIMS

IT IS APPALLING THAT WIKIPEDIAS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF EDITING IS BECOMING ANTIINTELLECTUAL AND FASCIST AND IN THAT WAY
IT IS PERHAPS EVOLVING INTO THE MODERN UNFORTUNATE STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY ESTABLISHMENT 

THERE IS NOTHING VANDALLIC ABOUT MY POSTS AND YOU ARE OUT OF LINE FOR LABELLING ME A VANDAL

CONSIDER THIS A FRIENDLY WARNING

Sincerely
The Legendary Danny ODoul
