Really What the fuck  The Paradise Edition 

First I added BTD The Paradise Edition and its bonuses because there wasnt a article or section about it Status came and deleted it saying seperate articles exist for a reason I was like Okay kinda right lets create a page to show Because for example Rihannas GGGB Reloaded had its page ONLY having 3 new tracks So I created because that section is being deleted although releases which are on EXACTLY THE SAME FORMAT album  ep  2CD rerelease GaGas and Kehas The Fame Monster and Animal  Cannibal having them on original albums The Fame Okay I knew it wasnt enough but I expected others to contribute However although a page reviewer Zeus reviewed the page and didnt touch someone came and deleted the page Now please someone tell me what to do because I really start to beg of this damn Wikipedia games
