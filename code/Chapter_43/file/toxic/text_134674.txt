In what way is saying its useful an NPOV issue If someone uses this for something then its useful  In my case I am reading an article on Markov logic networks wherein linguistic reification is one of the early steps followed by conversion to a lambda calculus form and then many other steps In this calculation reification is a crucial step  The natural stupidity article cited probably just says that using reified forms aka QLFs or quasilogical forms in certain ways is stupid it cannot claim that QLFs in and of themsels are useless
