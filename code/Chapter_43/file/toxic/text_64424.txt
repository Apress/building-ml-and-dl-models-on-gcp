Pathetic 

You know I know this doesnt make much of a contribution to the article butWHY ARE PEOPLE SO DOGGONE IRRATIONAL My mom hated absolutely hated video games and she refused to let me get even a realtime strategy She said video games are such a waste of time that its evil and that people who play any kind of digital game are turned into zombies It makes me so mad how people take their antivideo game sentiment to this extreme What the heck is wrong with video games Why are they considered a waste of time They are NOT a waste of time at least not games that arent related to Grand Theft Auto or some game like that My parents wouldnt even let me play fifteen minutes worth a day ITS SO DOGGONE IRRITATING I cant even see much of a difference between them and board games Good grief Tell me what purpose does this controversy serve except to try to get rid of the violence and sexual stuff of which I dissaprove but my mom didnt care whether or not they had that she wouldnt let us play
