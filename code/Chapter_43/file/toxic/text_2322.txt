MFNickster I am not sure if you have ever had any exposure to
argumentative fallacies but just because she did not write about
exterminating the Negro Population in her biographical accounts
does not mean it was an idea she was wholly against There seems to
be enough evidence out there to warrant a section in the article re
this topic  I am not sure why you have such a hard on for her Was she your grandmother or something
