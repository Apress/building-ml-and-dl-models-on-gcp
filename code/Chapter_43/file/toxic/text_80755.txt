You are as emptyheaded a Wikipedian as I have ever met  You obviously do not know nor do you want to know nor do you want anyone else to know why San Francisco is a great city to live in  You are acting like a child because you refuse to view the images as they are offered for free  Historcal exciting images of a great city  There is no other site on the web such such a good collection of images of that great city available like that for free and you want to sit there and whine because copies are also availble for ordering
