Rude 

Ummmm excuse you I just posted a THANK YOU to you on here And you just deleted it Wow like literally how RUDE can you be Thats a personal attack RIGHT THERE Second of all this isnt even about that Im trying to make that ugly page of the List of most expensive films slightly less horrible The years are centered the references are centered but the budgets arent That makes ZERO sense and its triggering to me someone who has OCD And you have the guts to tell me its  not needed I need to use that Wikipedia list a lot and I cant stand that it isnt centered How does that in ANY way affect YOU How dare you How about leaving me the hell alone before I report you for stalking GOODBYE
