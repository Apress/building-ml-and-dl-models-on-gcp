I have contested the speedy deletion but as a man who respects the rules set in place I have not removed your request for speedy deletion
 

Re AND Atleast7isbiggerthanRowan27s           
I just thought I would bring this to your attention too

 

Thank you for respecting the rules Please understand no one is picking on you for being new Simply put neither the label nor the band meet Wikipedias notability requirements for music at this time If that changes in the future you are more than welcome to resubmit them both  

Thanks for having the decency to explain  being new plays little role in my concern this is in fact not a new concept to me it is simply a lack of practical understanding of the scripting used in Wiki stuff  and in the meantime I appreciate your forwardness Im sure it will not be too long until we can do all this again
 

 User Name 

Not sure exactly why but your User Name is genius and is cracking me up   

Thanks very much I try

WELL  We did put do not delete the page  we are working on it  could yooh at least give the page an hour after being created or so  we just made it  my sistaer and  i

I got it covered

loli got it covered i found the template and I am goin to add it nowbut thans anywayoh and i can see u were about to delete the page me and ma sister the girl in tha comment above dis one aka Nicki Bookiemade u reallly should be a little more considerate when wikipedians put things like we are working on it dont delete no offensee  

None taken Likewise there is an under construction template you can use for new articles rather than DO NOT DELETE DIS PAGE CAUSE WE STILL EDITIN IT which really doesnt belong on an article page under any circumstances Thanks  

lol thanks  

J J M Roberts
I saw you had notability concerns about J J M Roberts I expressed the same but another user  suggested that holders endowed chairs at major universities are almost always notable If thats correct I guess the question is Is Roberts an exception to the rule  talkcontribs 
Thanks for bringing this to my attention It looks like he wrote some books too Im removing the tag and hopefully someone can expand the article  

Arson Committee
What more information needs to be added

References for one Two college newspaper citations and two MySpaces doesnt cut it I tried to look for some myself but google yielded very few related hits More than ten minutes of recorded output for another A label Right now the whole thing smacks of blatant selfpromotion and that isnt what Wikipedia is for  

is there a way i can get that pages back so i can save it and reenter it when they have more references

Any admin should be able do that for you I think 


What right does a burned out stoner have to tell ANYONE they are not credible

You know I get that all the time 

What the fuck bongwarrior  Really dude please dont infringe upon our liberty to cover our hometown  The meaningless stats do little to reflect the true character of elkhorn however the dating scene section certainly does  

Happy Bong Hitting

I wasnt infringing anything I was reverting obvious vandalism
