hey warrens fuck you too Uncivil manner means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert thats what uncivil means So yeah your a big winner champ and wont get banned Asshole 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gates balls is mislabelled anti trust controversy Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision ita court ruling like it or not theres no controversy too that Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial to the tend bundy controversy since any court ruling merits this label 

Since theres a section on anti trust laws and vista its worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the courts injuction And this does have bearing on vista You cant quote the ms pr saying we dont know what they want us to do its all questions or whatever else he mentioned without an adjunct sentence of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista

So like i said if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion things would be different

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way and being completely uncivil and rude about it merits from my part a roayl fuck ys all take your mouths off of gates balls and then we can talk
