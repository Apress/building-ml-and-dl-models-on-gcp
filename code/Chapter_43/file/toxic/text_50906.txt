I may assure you that I am sober by now Somehow I still dont give a shit So please block me for as long as you like but mainly leave me be Why should I do research giving it for free and even have to fight for it with idiots like 4meter4 who instead of put the citation to quotation marks he delete it and than another idiot blocks me for no reason I sing profesionaly I sing falsetto whole my life never heard it is breathy and never heard any breathy falsetto at all even from countertenor  who DO NOT sing falsetto which I do simply because it would be technically impossible for them But 4meter4 has in his article he has there that it is breathy so it must be truth Good bye
