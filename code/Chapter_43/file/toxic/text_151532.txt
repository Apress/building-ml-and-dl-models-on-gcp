unneccisary crap 

saying that thing about naruto is completely not needed as well as the fact that the terms itself is fan made naming an action that happens in anime

i seriously doubt that acne faced wapanese made up hammerspace after the act started some 70 years before in american cartoons

you also have no proof that the term is accosiated with anime all the time either and the fact that many more people know about mickey mouse and bugs bunny than ranmafag or whatever completely proves that wrong there
