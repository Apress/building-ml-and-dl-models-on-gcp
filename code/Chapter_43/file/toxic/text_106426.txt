Drmies you are full of shit As has been pointed out to you you should not be blocking where you are involved But rest assured I consider it an honor to be blocked by you I am sure that you believe you are an honest decent fellow Some of the worst liars begin with lies to themselves I stand by all of my comments They are true and accurate The abuse I described is 100 accurate and far from me needing to be blocked the editors attacking me should be but it will never happen I dont sweat it but Im not going to stay silen about the abuse Dishonest bullying and harasment are not okay The abusive history and the NUMEROUS accusations of bad faith against me speak for themselves I have been absolutely transparent about my reasoning and motives and I am very happy with the work Ive done here I am most proud that I have stood up against some of the worst admin abuse dishonest and harassment by POV pushers like Drmies and other dishonest characters that abuse Wikipedia to advance their personal point of view and gang up on people they disagree with me Your ridiculous associate professor is no more notable than a professor commentary is a perfect example You want to be held in high esteem and to be highly respected But respect is earned Drmies and there is very little about your behavior or how you treat others that merits respect You should stop drinking so much and reflect on who you are as a person Seriously
