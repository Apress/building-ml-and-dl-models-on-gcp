Plot 
I changed  this is a highly fictionalised account of Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acostas actual trip to Las Vegas around the same time period
This is contracticed many times through out the article In one instance under the Pre production sub heading it says
Depp remembers He saved it all Not only is the book true but theres more And it was worse

Later on under the sub heading Reaction it says
Apparently it all came flooding back to him he was reliving the whole trip He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster ducking and diving shouting SHIT LOOK OUT GODDAM BATS That was fantastic  if he thought wed captured it then we must have done it
Although it is a far fetched story it is not highly fictionalised and regardless it cant say it is if there are statements throughout the rest of the article from direct sources that are saying it is real
