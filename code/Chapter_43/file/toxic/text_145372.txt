Wow this is disruptive you are 100 mistaken and hellawrong and Im certain it is not the first time If Im not mistaken It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but dont be a Bully or a dick Specifically which socalled unreliable source were you accusing me of using  I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be Which source specifically are you referring to Make sure you are accurate because if you are wrong WPSPADE I will accurately call you a liar  This is hardly constructive conversation about the entry or the subject matter it should discuss which is the actual purpose of this talk page  

To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack Now both of you doing it  Glad I dont have to type this twice so I applies to both of you plus anyone else who wants to jump on 
It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but youd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada UK and Australia hasnt ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale across continents from airplanes I hope thats not the case here  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy I dare you in fact I doubledogdare you It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website Ill assume good faith perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts It ok Im ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap Based on you comments about me this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with Any competent person would understand they are not the same Is there was one available to you to explain it I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page You are pretty dense of you dont have it yet  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything youll ever find on about this fringe topic  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus TBD  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility Ive never seen anything like it except with the Japanese  They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs Department of National Defence Canada Biological Warfare Talk to me once you Understand its significance It is 245 whole pages of you and your poor attitude being epically wrong Tell me or tell all of us about how its not true  Next as a recently uncovered case Associated Press Planes covertly dropping chemicals on kids  Want the whole report  See the Lawsuits over it That should get you and people like you somewhere near the truth someday but my guess is for people like you it never will  Bad sources that dont back my viewpoint Hardly Check your own lack of sources Where the source you just referred to both of need to answer this Youve made an accusation me about my sources back it up
