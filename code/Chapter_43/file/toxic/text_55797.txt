You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war  according to the reverts you have made on Srebrenica massacre Users who edit disruptively or refuse to collaborate with others may be blocked if they continue In particular the threerevert rule states that making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24hour period is almost always grounds for an immediate block If you find yourself in an editing dispute use the talk page to discuss controversial changes Work towards wording and content that gains consensus among editors If unsuccessful then do not edit war even if you believe you are right Post a request for help at an appropriate noticeboard or seek dispute resolution In some cases it may be appropriate to request temporary page protection If edit warring continues you may be blocked from editing without further notice 

 Please do not attack other editors as you did at Srebrenica massacre Comment on content not on contributors Personal attacks damage the community and deter users Please stay cool and keep this in mind while editing Thank you   TALK 

You first piss off a user and then pretend to advise that user on how detrimental being pissed off is Wow Im so pissed Im so Im soooo fuck off pig Now that was quite polite of me you got to admit it Or was it not good enough for sophisticated ears of an average warmongering AngloSerb Freemason who thinks everyone is buying his bullshit LOL
