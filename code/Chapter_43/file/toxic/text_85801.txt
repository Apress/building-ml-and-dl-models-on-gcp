I still cannot believe that there can be a controversy over our national anthem This is absurd What the hell happened Freedom of speech I am all for it But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting immigrants Theyre IMMIGRANTS they CHOSE to come to Canada and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions though keeping their customs and traditions I have nothing against multiculturalism We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country Its like subjecting to bullying its not bloody right And the usage of God and son means nothing Its a traditional piece I am an atheist and an agnostic yet I have no objection to prayer in my schools chapel to singing Christian lyrics because it pertains no meaning to me Are not God Jesus Allah Mohammed Buddha and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause Should not they all be friends SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem Allah Jesus Mohammed Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON THING CAUSE REASON The Canadian anthem is traditional and it seems to me almost a sacrilege if you may excuse the poor choice of word as it seems to contradict my whole speech to complain about it being sexist or bigotry This ties in with the controversy over the Queen She is a testament to the tradition of Canada to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States We are not Yanks we are members of the commonwealth To get back on track I state clearly there is absolutely no logical moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song A song is a song You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song like The Beatles You just dont do it So HOW should it be the same for the anthem The anthem represents what Canada is It was established as Christian and though we gladly accept other cultures we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there Its IMPOSSIBLE Freedom of speech has become the opposite Comedians cant make jokes about religion sexuality gender without being complained at reprimanded at by minorities Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run They say to immigrants You make the choice to live here That means you have to live with the way Australians live Australian code Australian traditions Dont come here expecting us to change just for you This is how a country should be It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed Oh is that politically incorrect to the homeless Ill change that to area of rest and not grumble and whine prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner Please I beg I PRAY God forbid heheheh that we all come to our senses and realize Dont sweat the small stuff Get on toughen up put your helmet on keep on trucking Its an imperfect world you cant have your way all the time If someone at high school insults you you ignore it You stay away from them SO Does that not apply to here Please chew on this rather large and I do apologize for its length paragraph
