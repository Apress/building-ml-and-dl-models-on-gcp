A serious question
You obviously enjoy being as nasty as you possibly can be in acceptable ways that dont threaten to get you blocked  My question is dont you ever get tired of being dead wrong about so many things so often in such a needlessly nasty manner and so publicly in front of your fellow editors Vandals suck  Eight year olds with access to the internet suck too  But its people like you who maintain a facade of respectability while being absolutely horrible to other people who are really the worst members of the Wikipedia community
