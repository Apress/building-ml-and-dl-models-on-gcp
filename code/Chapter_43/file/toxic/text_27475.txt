Your donation will fund Wikia Inc which is not a charity Your nonprofit donation will ultimately line the forprofit pockets of Jimmy Wales Amazon Google the Bessemer Partners and other corporate beneficiaries How Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine As of December 2008 there are over 14700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales Wikiacom sites which are funded by Google AdSense revenues Did you know that Amazon invested 10000000 in the forprofit Wikia venture Its therefore rather interesting that there are over 43000 links to Amazons retail site from the supposedly nonprofit Wikipedia site Isnt it Meanwhile did you know that the popular movie site IMDBcom is owned by Amazon and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages Well surprise surprise  there are nearly 174000 links to Amazons IMDB site from Wikipedia No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia Inc Its cofounder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine 

Now here is the really fascinating thing If you go to Jimmy Wales talk page on Wikipedia and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his forprofit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or selfdealing Jimbo wont even have time to respond One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message and if you try one more time to ask this question youre likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether Go ahead try it
