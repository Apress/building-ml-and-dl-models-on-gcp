I think you went overboard here and blew your load a little too quickly by blocking me for a week for posting on my own talk page  It really is quite ridiculous I have understood that users on wikipedia have far greater leeway on their own user talk pages and user pages and asking other users to stay off is an accepted practice  My comments on the Sarah Palin edit summary probably went over the line and deserved either a warning or 1 day block because of the article probation and I should not have reacted the way I did to the other users instigation  But again I note that I did not notice you posting a similar warning to the user who said in his edit summary towards me then stop posting biased crap  
Your entitled to do whatever the fuck you want on wikipedia Coffee because you have the powers which are very hard to take away but really learn how to read what you link to  Lookup what the definition of harassment I didnt threaten or try to intimidate you  I might have insulted you and your fragile sensibilities but I certainly did not harass you  I stick by what I said though please fuck off my talk page after this situation is done  Keep fucking that chicken  Bits andPieces
