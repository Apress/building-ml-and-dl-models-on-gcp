I dont understand youre motivation for blocking me You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk pageI presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it Im not sure if you were confused or simply refrained from viewing his last two edits His last two edits were what motivated me to my accusation He replaced the page with utter nonsense After you blocked me you didnt even rv his vandalism I assume your decision to block me was an accidentbut it does seem suspectespecially considering your recent and persistent need to engage me in convos which really dont concern you Woohookity and that vfd consensus I read your comment at southerncomforts talkpage and I think you should know that I have not mislead her as i have never talked to this user You said you blocked universaliss for a weekdo you mean you blocked himher yesterday and this will last for a week No matter I simply want that user to stop 1 reverting to oldoutdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies 2 stop the personal attacks and religious attacks towards Protestants Jews and Ahmadis 3and stop deleting information that heshe disagrees with I really dont think this is asking that much In terms of diffusing the situationI tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to His response was too massively delete info in various sections and add in comments like you fucking troll  0326 August 1 2005 UTC
