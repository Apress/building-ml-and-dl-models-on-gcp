In defence of China 

Hey Koreans who the fuck do you think youre dealing with Guess what Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks After the fall of the Tang Dynasty close to 700000 were incorporated into Tang history a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains 100000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100000 into Xinluo Silla Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield despite being a significantly smaller force If anything Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal nothing more The greatest threat came from the TuBo TuJue and HuiHe from the west Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores
