Oh noes  The person who is engaged in trying to have his way feels that Im being incivil  Whatever will I do  Is there no defense against the fretful porpentine of an acronym on my talk page  I have been labeled now  I have been assessed and I am incivil
John youre making yourself look an ass  You jump up and down trying to puff up that you in your majesty have assessed 40000 articles  Im sorry that Im not impressed  You say that the article is incomplete because it isnt the same as a copyrighted source  Im sorry but youre wrong about that and your efforts at trying to say otherwise are making you look worse by the minute  You are sacrificing your reputation for what  When I dont play nice and I do not play nice with some aspects of the meddling Projects you start trying to again go with intimidation and majesty
The problem is that youve undercut yourself with errors of fact mistakes in outlook enunciation of incompatible goals and now trying to reach for official power to remedy the situation  Thats hideous and it marks you are temperamentally incompatible  You should not behave in that way  A good administrator knows better than to threaten silly things like you are insulting me when theyve been in multiple reverts  In fact the utter triviality of the stakes involved make you look even worse  They make you look like a troll
This is simply disgraceful  Go away please and assess other assessings but the assigninity is simply overwhelming here and now
