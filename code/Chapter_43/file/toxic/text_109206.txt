Ok now I really dont understand you Youve gone and tagged ImageDamnation Crusade1jpg for deletion Why Its from the very damn website that sells the comic If they didnt want the picture to be used as a representation of the series then they wouldnt of used it as a representation of the series themselves Its bloody well low resolution too What more do you want EditorFag
Obviously I cant argue with compulsive editorfags like you Fine delete it and the ImageForge of War1jpg one Im just trying to add images to help the community on wikipedia to improve the articles that call for pictures I see it that it does comply to all of the image policies except perhaps that one resolution rule but then again if youve got a problem with it then you can easily solve it yourself Im not going to be forced to do the work of an editorfag like yourself
