I fail to see the relevance of the reference to the word fuck in the pronunciation discussion  If pronounced with the original German pronunciation fooksya doesnt sound any more like fuck than the word fork does and I dont believe the possiblity of mispronunciation as fucksya is what leads most people to say fyewsha instead Pronouncing Latinized botanical names based on words and names from nonLatin languages is always going to be a problem and there is simply no rule in botanical nomenclature that such names must be pronounced according to the rules of pronunciation of their original language
