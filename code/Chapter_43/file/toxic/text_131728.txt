Are you fing kidding me There are 30 reliable sources listed in the prevandalism history of the page This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone If you want to see the sources

 Go look at the history of the page prevandalism
 Go look at the history of the talk page prevandalism
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30 sources are extensively discussed and analyzed and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of reliable which you have not familiarized yourself with 

This debate has already been done and its very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page Without an admin in my pocket my claims fall on deaf ears I understand this all too well If you or your allies were interested in due process you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail When youve read this entire page httpsenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaArticles_for_deletionThe_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care Shame on all of you for your intellectual laziness dishonesty and irresponsible deleter reflexes
