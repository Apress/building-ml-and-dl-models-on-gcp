Wow your a dick 

Hey there apparantly you deleted my page on Wikipedia First of all let me say that you are A FUCKING DICK reading your comments it would seem you do this a lot And I have to ask you what the fuck is your problem I should be allowed to post stuff on wikipedia along with the many other users whose articles youve deleted I dont care if you dont think they have meaningful content and although mine wasnt all that meaningful your contributions to this site arent either In fact you arent in my opinion contributing anything So stop deleting peoples work get off the computer and get a life because if you can find my article in a few second after I created it you obviously have none I hate to be so harsh but its wrong to do that
