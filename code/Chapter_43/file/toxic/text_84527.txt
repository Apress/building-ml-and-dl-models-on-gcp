Did you read the user attack
Did you actually read the attack on the user Yamla or did you just spot a few words see a few opinions you didnt like and make a snap judgement The only reason I put it there is because noone listens elsewhere I wont get a response to this because you know you wrong sure I did ruin his page but I didnt attack him I just had to make sure he understands hey I can admit where I went wrong can you But of course if you dont agree with the admin on wikidelusion you should fuckoff right Can I have a structured debate about the actions against myself and the user Eddieebo debating against the collective admin of wikipedia primarily the people who imposes actions on myself and Eddieebo Or are you afriad to be proven wrong yet again
