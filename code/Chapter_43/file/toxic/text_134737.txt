Hateful mod 

abusing his power to reedit i guess as long as you make the blanket statement i dont think your edits were right i didnt check but im lazy so ill just delete it you can delete what you want

its a shame that the mods dont stop a single person who actively tries to destroy an entire section of wikipedia by putting legit articles up for deletion i guess you guys are trolling friends who troll like this all the time instantly fucking up legit edits like mine just because you dont have a real life sad very pathetically sad
