Once again you are taking this way too personally My apologies if I have offended you I do not care about edit warring nor do I think I ever will This is the internet learn how to chill out Not everything here is serious business If I was blocked from Wikipedia it would not end the world for me As it is I have posted a ton of sources validating my claim that there is a relatively popular blog which criticizes Marmaduke on the internet which is read by people in the talk section as you requested If people do not believe me after this I will think people have gone defunct You have still not answered my question about how you have designated authority over me and I am getting tired of asking you Why was my posting deleted after several months of being up on the page Why was a user who is on trail for being a bot allowed to delete my posting You know I came here to do one simple thing not argue on the internet like an idiot But this whole thing has done terrible damage to my self esteem I am sorry you do not wish to work with me again as I think I have eloquently and passionately stated my points which you have attempted to refute by pointing me to some rules page I hope that the links I have posted are proof enough and that I will finally be allowed by the grace of the Wikipedia editors to post one chunk of information which is true and not inane regarding critcism of Marmaduke Good fucking lord I did not think things would be this hard

Again I apologize for what I did to your page and that other guys page I was mad and a little drunk

Thanks
