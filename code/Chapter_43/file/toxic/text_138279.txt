To these authors an Islamophobic position typically encompasses the belief that Islam intrinsically promotes religious fanaticism violent tendencies towards nonMuslims terrorism and that Islam is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality tolerance democracy and human rights

Islam does intrinsically promote religious fanaticism does promote violence and illfeeling towards nonMuslims does seem to spawn many terrorists and is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality tolerance democracy and human rights

I thought a phobia was an irrational fear of something 

I admit that I do fear Islam the belief system but I dont consider this a phobia It seems quite rational to me I just dont want to see many more countries becoming anything like Iran with sinners being put to death for commiting crimes that are merely breaches of Islam 

Islam does seem to promote a desire to do away with secular democracies and impose Islam as a form of government Muslims somehow manage to evoke more uneasiness in me even than George Bush and his loony Fundamentalist Christian friends

Religion is such a scourge on our species Killing each other over invisible dieties who dont even exist Dumb
