Vinny Burgoo  suspected sock puppet

Are you ever going to withdraw this accusation Its currently the second hit with a Google search with Vinny Burgoo my one and only online identity for nearly ten years and its wholly bogus Someone posted something in support of something very stupid I had done at Wiktionary I called a serial Wiki tyrant a ct after he had unambiguously broken Wikis rules then I compounded this by threatening him in what I thought at the time to be a transparently jocular manner but wasnt and this supporter was assumed to be me using another identity and another IP trying to get around a temporary block I still use Wikipedia a lot but have no interest whatsoever in editing it ever again so by all means say that I was blocked for disruptive editing guilty I got fed up with the lot of you or whatever else I was accused of before this puppeteer nonsense was settled on the crime kept changing but Im not happy with what you currently show  Take it down or else

A genuine threat this time Well see
