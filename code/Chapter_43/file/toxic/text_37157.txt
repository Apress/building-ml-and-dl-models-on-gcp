Thats laughable I tried editing and I was completely civil at the time I was incorrectly accused of being a sockpuppet and banned without any evidence being presented In fact when I tried to appeal it the admins mocked my appeals and didnt address my arguments So when Im told I need to play nice and wikipedia wants new editors I know it is completely bullshit If wikipedia really wanted new editors they wouldnt falsely accuse and ban people for shit they arent guilty of We all know the truth you will get banned for wrongthink Nothing on wikipedia really has to do with policy 

Hell Ill even show you my account if you want Why would I bother making another one when it would just get banned without justification 6742180219
