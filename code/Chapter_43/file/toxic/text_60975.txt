Killer Im sorry that you have misread my unblock request If you reread it you will see that my use of popeyed chihuahua there refers specifically accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WPPA as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random The explanation was not as you seem to think offered in mitigation Indeed my original unblock request which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold stated 

The following will help the reviewing admins to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors Killer has a picture of a popeyed chihuahua dog on her user page  captioned I look like this and she is in the habit of referring to herself in her sysopping summaries as a dog   eg Puppy has spoken Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killers expense 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfolds request

My unblock request in no way implies that it is somehow OK to insult you because you refer to yourself as puppy It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you

I have apologised and still do for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WPPA and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere which it is
