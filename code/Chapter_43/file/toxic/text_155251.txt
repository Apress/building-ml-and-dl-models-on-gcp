Freedom of speech
I notice you removed my final speech How sad So what next remove this remove all of my edits 
You have pontificated over my edits in Liverpool and now you accuse me of being an abuser Your spiel with Kitchen Knife thus Ive given him an ultimatum to change or be managed off Wikipedia outright His presence has been a netnegative for Wikipedia and Im only just beginning to scratch the surface of his damage to categories and articles

My point though Well I dont have many Liverpool Merseyside articles watchlisted so if you recieve ANY abuse from this user or you spot a repeat of the cycle do please let me know and Ill turn on the electric fense This also applies to ip addresses and suspected sockpuppets you encounter

Hopefully this will put an end to this nonsense that has been damaging the Merseyside corner of Wikipedia for the last 8 or 9 months Hope youre well keep in touch  Jza84   Talk   here  is particularly offensive to me yet you make out that I am guilty of being the problem here EXCUSE me I must have missed something Oh you also played judge and jury How interesting You do have it cushy now dont you Hope you enjoy being a smart arse
