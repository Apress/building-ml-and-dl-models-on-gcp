Rajbir Singh link 

You removed my link which I posted to Rajbeer Singh wwwrajbeersinghcom because you said it was written by a fan  Well with this logic also then remove the IMBD link because that too has been written by a fan  Dont be hypocritical be consistent  You cant justify the removal of one link because it has been written by a fan and not the other  I pity the fact that you are in a dead end poor excuse for a job and that acting like a pain in the arse to other people gives your miserable excuse for a career a sense of false purpose  However most of the articles on Wikipedia itself have been written by fans  are you going to close down Wikipedia  Bloody jokers
