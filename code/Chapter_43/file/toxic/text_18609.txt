HI JohnHistory

Yes you will be blocked and your thoughtful post here deleted by someone like Tarc  The main thing to realize is that Wikipedia has always been and will always be a clusterfuck  If youre interested in finding out detailed histories of the lives of anime characters its a start but other than that its virtual pages are only good for wiping virtual shit out of your virtual asshole  This place attracts the worst kind of assholes and its hard to trust in the good faith of something from which nothing but shit and hot air spews forth  They decide what a proper source is they decide whats been discussed in the media just like they decide which place in SF has the best glory holes  Any type of internet arrangement with a hierarchy attracts the worst type of vaginal discharge  Wikipedias political content is governed by a bunch of aborted leftists who read a couple of pages of Das Kapital decided it was nice and then put it down  They are a bunch of fucking cocksuckers literally and figuratively
