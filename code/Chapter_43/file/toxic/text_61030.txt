Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didnt have such a good weekend First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden Now accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created
On Friday reports surfaced that the marriedbutdivorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag On Saturday Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website which he later moved to his personal site denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundations policies and stating that the affair had ended Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay
So whats the big deal when a relationship goes sour Well the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her clean up what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes
Former associates of Wales are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool who left the foundation last year wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the nonprofit foundation as his own personal piggy bank Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included 300 bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors Wool alleges According to Wool the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales corporate credit card
There were occasions where he used the Wikimedia Foundation for personal advancement under the guide of the mission  And as someone who was in there for the mission part of it I found that rather distressful Wool told EPICENTER
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment
