Camille Paglia On the other hand Ive been saying in public for five years ago as someone whos endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sexpositive experience that Im concerned about the effect on young people  people growing up from 8 10 14 in a climate where its gone to the opposite direction Im already out there concerned about this so Im really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticismIve been saying this for years that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism Im for eroticism 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic Paglias academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history Paglias key importance to sexpositive feminism is not only her writings on sex but her advocacy of traditional values like canon texts Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma a conservative and academic feminist who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture Paglia has in many ways presented a respectable face for prosex feminism to the world at large
