Well so now Im apparently not allowed to posts facts to support an article just because I may know someone Hmm sounds like it would be easier to provide facts if I did know someone Anyways since I cant maybe wikipedia should do reasearch on the facts presented to them instead of completely ignoring them Go ahead and file your damned report Im getting sick of you people pretending like this is an open encyclopedia anyways Youve been present with more than enough well documented facts by people other than myself that fall well within Wikipedias guidelines and they still have yet to be posted So all I have to say is take that report and stick it up your ass
