AM making a formal complaint about your biased stance 

I have more than enough evidence how you have SELECTIVELY erased certain UNorthodox POV which YOU deem unacceptable

So in which case i will ask does WIKI accept the unorthodox churchs POV or ONLY THE ORTHODOX CHURCH

and ALSO will question your ability on integrity where you HAVE SELECTED THREE PASSAGES with minimal scholary debate in which the scholars you DEBATED agree that no meat eating passages exist BUT IN YOUR BIASED STANCE YOU HAVE PROTECTED ONLY AN ORTHODOX POV
