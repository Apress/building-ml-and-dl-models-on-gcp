ALL of the comments made under the section F is now for Falcon  are from me  And then both of you stuff and gw responded to them

I am going to delete my own comments  What you do with yours is up to you  If you keep putting mine back in than that is vandalism and I will have YOU blocked

As for Clinton
1 During the first administration they had a policy outlawing human space travel beyond LEO
2 I read on httpwwwspacepoliticscom that a Clinton staffer recently showed an interest in supporting private space companies such as Bigelow
3 During the first administration they really wanted to make a woman NASA administrator  They may do so this time around
