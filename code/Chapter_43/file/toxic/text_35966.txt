Are you retarded or what 

So what you want  
You think PSP Wiki is have trusted sources Its copy of Wikipedia and users are adding information not Sony  
In PSP Wiki is written The latest reported firmware version shipping preinstalled on new PSPs is 550 confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP3000 Special Edition Harry Potter Version   
This have trusted sources confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP3000 Special Edition Harry Potter Version OH YES SONY CONFIRMED THAT OR WHAT and even world bought is written wrong  
Actually a new PSPs have a version 570 or higher Even in Wikipedia is written 570This firmware is only available preinstalled on new PSPN1000 PSPgo models and cannot be downloaded SO ARE YOU BLIND OR WHAT AND HOW CAN BE THIS POSTED IF IT DOESNT HAVE SOURCE  
And 570 is also installed on new PSPs 3000 I can confirm that On PSPs came with limited edition GT bundle I bought onealready sold it because its not hackable  
If you still dont belive me read there
