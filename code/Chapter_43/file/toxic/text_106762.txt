warnings 

I have numerous warnings from you about vandilization and me being homophobic  I have NEVER written anything in wikipedia why does it say that I have done all these horrible things  I cant believe that someone would insult me on a personal level just because they assume I have done something  I am deeply hurt that you would call me homophobic my college education is in defending people from discrimination why on earth would i discriminate against anyone  I would also never think of vandalizing the site i didnt even know i could delete or rewrite things on here  In using this website i understand that it is public opinion and not fact and why would i have the right to change or vandalize anyone elses opinions andor beliefs  If i dont agree w something on your site i just go to another site that includes factual information to be used as a real reference  You have no right to resort to namecalling with customers of this site how dare you
