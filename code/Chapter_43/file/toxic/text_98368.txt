There is no text established by consensus and such a ridiculous claim makes it clear that you are in fact one of the Polish POV pushers I suggest you read the talk page if you are really ignorant of the Erika Steinbach controversy that has been going on since 2004 or more precisely her biography getting vandalized by Poles Your edit warring may like Space Cadet has experiencied 7 times lead to a block Yes the Polish edit warring is extremely disruptive and I think Wikipedia finally ought to find a solution to all this shit Blocking all access from Poland would be a good idea
