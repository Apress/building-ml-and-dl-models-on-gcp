Are you fucking stupid Do you have brain damage I just clearly told why you have no fucking right to demand civility from people You cant actually argue against this which is why you robotically recite some bullshit Wikipedia guidelines that went out the window the second the site decided to feature The Human Centipede on its front page

What kind of a fucking moron thinks its ok to attack insult and harass people as long as no bad words are used What kind of a supreme retard crybaby then brings down the banhammer when the target has the gall to fight back

And youre even talking about damaging the community Gee I wonder how having The Human Centipede as a featured article might damage the community Im sure absolutely nobody will be offended by being forcibly subjected to this perfectly wholesome movie Ive already removed Wikipedia from my bookmarks bar because clearly theres no telling what kind of shit Ill have to see when I view the front page This is no longer an encyclopedia this is 4chan pretending to be an encyclopedia   0918
