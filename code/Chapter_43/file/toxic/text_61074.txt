this is stupid i defent the actions of UserCerejota in TalkDigg and then UserKrimpet threatens to ban me i then post in TalkDigg that the cost of defending UserCerejota is banning and then UserLeki and UserAndroid Mouse threaten to ban me too UserAndroid Mouse also reverts my changes so i harass them back was there a more proper warning i should have made against UserLeki probably but i dont know what it is

but then  in general WPAGF i dont see how i was ever uncivil the one example UserKrimpet provides is bogus that was intended as a joke and if you cant take it as a joke thats your problem it certainly isnt worthy of a ban

id post this on your talk page UserKrimpet but because of the ban i can only post on mine so i hope you read my talk page and apologize apologize and make UserLeki and UserAndroid Mouse do the same either that or you should step down because you are clearly a disgrace to wikipedia

oh sry my saying youre a disgrace to wikipedia violates WPCIVIL doesnt it maybe you should have thought of that before you violated WPCIVIL yourself and threatened to ban me and perhaps UserLeki and UserAndroid Mouse should have thought of that too you cant expect civility when the people youre engaging in friendly debate with try to subvert your arguments by banning you or deleting them all together that ive been civil up to know is pretty amazing and i should be commended for it  not banned for it
