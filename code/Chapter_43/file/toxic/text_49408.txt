If Wikipedia is going to play fluffer to Matt Sanchez and call his gay porn videos awardwinning then I think it should include a full videography He appears in 35 or 40 of those flicks The full lists are verified by the Internet Movie Database and the Internet Adult Movie Database Also the specific nature of the awards should be listed such as best ass on someone wearing a cowboy hat or whatever it is that they award in that industry
