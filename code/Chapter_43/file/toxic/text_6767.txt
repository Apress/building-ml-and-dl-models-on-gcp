Furthermore although I am a political opponent of James on many levels it is not I who believes that calling him a faggot will hurt his cause on a political level  You just refuse to acknowledge that he was called this during the reign of his son to according to the accepted standards of the time period thought it would be scandalous and outright damaging to his rule  Because of their convention the slurs did help portray his rule as the beginning of the end for those who were out to get him  Now you repeat homophobic insults and intertwine your own homosexuality with his identity although he was a straight man stuck in a quicksand of backbiting that included homophobic language  Why perpetuate falsehoods other than to make yourself feel better that somebody famous is alleged to be gay like you especially if you like to smear him as a hypocrite for all the abuse you suffered by fundie Bible thumpers  It is obvious where you stand or bend over in this  2425511149
