Dont Revert me Biaatch

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry   
    
 I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerrys DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq   
    
 After all Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments   
    
 My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia in other words AT LEAST 90 of you   
    
 In 2004 the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERSAP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam figuring it gave Kerry an edge So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth it was LOL With additional props to Dan Rather   
    
 In 2006 the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERSAP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge   
    
 And thanks to Senator John Kerry the Dan Rather of 2006 this years election is about Iraq    
    
 Except not quite the way they intended LOL   
    
    
    
 And no saying it was joke just wont cut it    
    
 This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops From Kerrys GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich to Howard Dean to a San Francisco where Nancy Pelosi is from supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military the antipathy is indelible   
    
 And saying Hey I wasnt trying to insult our troops just our Commander in Chief   
 only makes it worse The American Legion certainly isnt buying it   
    
    
 Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too   
    
 Senator John Kerry  You cant blame the Swift Boat Vets this time
