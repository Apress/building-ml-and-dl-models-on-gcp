Are you an Idiot Mr Caribbean HQ 

Why are you reverting my changes while I am still editing the page Or is it just that removal of proAmerican references and any informed edits infuriate you Please desist from reverting my changes unless you are sure that they are 1 quite finished and 2 unbiased

I suppose your thick head wont get some minor points of etiquette that are required of a realworld editor given that you have won these allpowerful Wikipedia edits 

Please also tell me if you are plain stupid or plain proAmerican before reverting my changes IN OTHER WORDS PLEASE STOP VANDALISING MY EFFORTS AT WIKIPEDIA
