You are a dumb flower 

Now normally I do not use that term explicitly I just quietly think it But in this case there is evidence You have no ISBNs to your name In my book that makes you a dumb flower I happened to a bit demanding about these sorts of things The ISBNs  1894840364 and 1894840380  Tell me something At you local library do they actually allow you in there Maybe they just let you in because you are a girl I dunno  Do they have an oldfashioned card catalog system there Do you experience urges to rip out the cards of the books that you simply do not like I can assure you that you need to try and suppress those urges OF COURSE I added those ISBNs for you dear It is like honey to flies Dumb cunts like you cannot suppress their urges to go and delete them  And thereby I trap you my pretty little dumb flower
