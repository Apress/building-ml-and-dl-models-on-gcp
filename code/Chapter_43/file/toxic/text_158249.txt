Singleissue nutjobs 

For some reason this page is attracting nutters  one of whom comes back over and over again trying to impose American spelling not merely on an entry written without it but also upon actual quotations from British books that use English spelling This is not acceptable and will not be permitted

Equally it is not acceptable for the other nutcase to keep trying to replace the psychoanalysts carefully chosen word unpleasure frequently unconscious and often somatic and usually without any moralising or judgemental aspect with the inadequate everyday and gentrifying literary word displeasure For the sake of ending this ignorant vandalistic campaign as soon as possible let me explain patiently that displeasure is connotatively different from and denotatively narrower than unpleasure  which is why psychoanalysis chose unpleasure and the textbooks continue to use it Displeasure is a stupid and misleading word to use in this context Keep your stupid and clueless hands off
