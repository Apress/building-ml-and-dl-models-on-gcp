Scjessey your tests changed nothing in fact it looks worse The episode list should span the width of the entire page not be bunched up to the left and looking all retarded You dony seem to understand what Ive been asking but at this point as far the BS has gone today I no longer give a crap what happens to this article anymore So do whatever you want To be honest my issue really wasnt how this article looked it was trying to call out certain people around here like Collectonian who claim they are enforcing Wikipedia policy and following standards that I know are complete lies and fabrications but those of you in charge just let it go on So be it
