Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter least squares spectral analysis But I cited 2 references that literally say trigonometric functions while your references all refer to another method Fourier analysis you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter though it is obvious they do not in your mind as you claimed it explicitly Fourier analysis is still the same as leastsquares spectral analysis which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations There is no reversals here not even technically speaking because what is going on is mine article authors cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around Just like so many editors noted everyone just look at Dicklyons talk page that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong  No 3RR violation on my part But I know why you just threatened with reporting me it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself Sinusoids is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance cleaning your shit is what it is
