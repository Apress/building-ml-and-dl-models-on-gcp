Its funny how the first people to throw around possible motives are always the ones who get it absolutely wrong They get it so completely wrong with all their guesses its almost as if they werent guesses at all but intentional deception Its pretty obvious at this point to anyone who can think that this guy Ivins was a Mossad asset He was a Jew carrying out a falseflag operation as Jews do he pretended to be a muslim terrorist he and his government pals wanted toremovea certain muslim researcher while manufacturing some more fear of muslim terrorism to get the American goyim more enthusiastic about letting themselves be slaughtered in Jew wars for Israel Oh you thought your soldiers use those pathetically insufficient body armors and faulty rifles cuz theres not enough money And so it goes Im not ruling out the possibility that this Ivins guy and his Zionist Bolshevist friends do this sort of stuff just as naturally as lions eat sheep instinctively but there may have been another motive for it as well They dont want their enemies muslims and other goyim standing around when theyre developing sophisticated biological weapons to take out entire races of humans perhaps only sparing the Gods Chosen the Master Race by any other name The Jews were the real Nazis all along Fools
