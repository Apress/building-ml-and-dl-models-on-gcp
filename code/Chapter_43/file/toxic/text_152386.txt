Any time that you gang up on people you dont like with other Jews as a collaborative effort you are violating NPOV and is WikipediaGaming the system  You foment unrest and aggravation by your trolling  Your Ad hominem reverts are based on those who are not Jewish or your brand of Jewish  Dont be a hypocrite because ypure speculating on Witkacys motives when you are suspected of harbouring ulterior motives yourself  You are hardly in a position to judge or guess  This apathetic way of dealing with everybody on Wikipedia is also a violation of WPCivility and WPPOINT  Nobody carews about how tough you think you are and how much you can push people around  Everything you are doing in effect is breaking WPNPA  The two pages on VFD are pushed because they only violate the will of certain Jews
