LOL rest assured there is nothing you can make me feel other than pity for you  And not sure what abuse of primary sources means other than you dont like to see the truth  But heres another from SAHIH Bukhari httpwwwusceduorgcmjereligioustextshadithbukhari046sbtphp003046711
Volume 3 Book 46 Number 711

    Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah

    A man amongst us declared that his slave would be freed after his death The Prophet called for that slave and sold him The slave died the same year

really not sure how much clearer this needs to be
