First of all Ive never been blocked before

Next let me be clear Mr UserAboutmovies vandalized an article Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap the editor who reverted the vandalism Then Pcap presumably out of frustration asked me for help as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcaps talk page I told him I would not get involved Why am I not active Because there are too many assholes like UserAboutmovies allowed to run free making life shitty for everyone  

Now Mr UserAboutmovies apparently having too much time on his hands snoops through my personal communications on Pcaps talk page And so after putting his nose where it doesnt belong he gets his nose out of whack and comes to my personal talk page and attacks me Why This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology He could have offered an apology He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs and repented in private No instead of doing the right honorable thing he instead chooses to attack me So who is escalating He is So I called him an asshole which he richly deserves So then he escalates some more he gets you to block me  You were sucked right into his game  You did not bother to do any due diligence AT ALL You should have blocked him not me  Once you realized your mistake which Pcap points out to you above you could have offered me an apology turned around and blocked Aboutmovies instead Did you bother to do any of these things No  You fucked up

So to summarize Fuck off tedder You are part of the problem and not part of the solution The sooner we get rid of fucking asshole admins like you the better wikipedia will be
