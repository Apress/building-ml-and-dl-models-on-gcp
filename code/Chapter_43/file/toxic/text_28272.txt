How is it the wrong way round If I had fucked up the pages when I edited stuff or had deleted information by accident then MAYBE I would have read the guidelines But my edits were perfectly harmless they must of taken you about 3 seconds to delete And you didnt actually point out what I was doing wrong writing disruptive all the time is a great help
