It is said some listeners spontaneously combusted while listening to Laffy Taffy I think we are gonna need the citations for that hahahaha FYI I wasnt the person who typed that

ok lets get something straight wikipedia is a FACTUAL encyclopedia not a opinionated one unless you can show us that it is considered to be the worst hiphop album made and that some spontaneously combusted while listening to Laffy Taffy which is extremely unlikely then you have all rights to say so dont come and bitch on wikipedia do that shit over at urbandictionary btw i hate the fucking album
