A bunch of nonacademic clowns are now censoring the info so Im wasting my breath talking to morons IMO

You and everyone deleting the 8 Prime Spirals are all LIARS the original article was CITED it cited peer level speed tests of all the top prime algorithms

Yet you twits claim not verified BS I VERIFIED MY CLAIMS

This is why the world of Academia considers wiki to be run by clueless power hungry twit mods that know nothing about academia

READ THE CITES IN THE ARTICLE YOU TWITS DELETED

I shouldnt even be wasting my breath on such nazi censoring worms

PUT THE PAGE BACK it was citd to GITHUB speed tests The new Prime Spirals beat all the other prime algorithms and wiki has pages for the slower prime algorithms

PUT IT BACK

httpsenwikipediaorgwiki8_prime_spirals

GITHUB is where the tests were done and not one real mathematician or computer programming expert question the results since anyone can duplicate them from the open source software

httpsmailpythonorgpipermailtutor2011December087209html

So the original article CITED major outside sources to PROVE THE CLAIMS
