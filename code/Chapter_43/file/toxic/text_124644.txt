I need temperance

You dont know the meaning of the word and it doesnt mean Whatever I king meco of noteworthiness and spokesperson for the world and all Christians and the alternative energy community says it means
Just because you can couch your anger in smugness doesnt make you superior it makes you a hypocrite Get over yourself and delete your account and all your opinions because God and I do not think they are noteworthy using your standard of noteworthiness Oh wait youre standard is Whatever I say is noteworthy because Im meco who babbles away on Wikipedia acting like Im king of all and represent everyone include those I speak against

As for me supposedly needing temperance get that log out of your own eye before fiddling with the splinter you imagine is in mine Get your priorities straight and stop being hypocritical  

Noteworthiness

Contesting the noteworthiness of the Nuadin was absurd again who the Hell are you mr royal we Are you the rep of noteworthiness The president of notability By your own arbitrary standard youre a nobody and yet you contest the notability of other while promoting yourself as someone whose opinion matters Youre taking advantage of a silly rule to exalt your nobody self Naudin is mentioned many times on Youtube and throughout the alternative energy community and was noted on a French news television channel and a spinoff of invention or rather spinoff of Townsend Browns invention was tested by Mythbusters who is noted on Wikipedia for their widely publicized experiments and theyve noted his work Noteworthinness depends on whoever considers a thing noteworthy not consensus Your this is not noteworthy to we is an immature stop making cheap shot Stop trying to force people to play your boring Dungeons and Dragons delusion with you I wont submit to your feelings
