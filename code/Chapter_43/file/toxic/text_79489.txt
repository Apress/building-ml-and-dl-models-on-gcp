I thought you said you were on wikibreak Its a lie but not an evil one 
Your slur against me your faux retraction and your reiteration of the lie are all examples of evil behavior If you change your behavior the way youre treated will change Remember focus on the behavior not the editor or in your idiosyncratic parlance the behavior of the editors identity I do not call you a liar I call your slur a lie A damnable one
