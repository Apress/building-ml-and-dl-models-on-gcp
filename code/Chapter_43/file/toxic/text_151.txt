SORRY PUCK BUT NO ONE EVER SAID DICK WAS NUMBER ONE But he is clearly listed as being second only to Batman and a master detective and martial artist and been trained in all the mentioned combat discplines No need to mention in skillsabilities about the battles hes lost and won because thats not what an encylopia is supposed to do 

Also what your problem is your going by low end showings and not HIGH end showings where hes proven more than a match for a meta like Slade and pinned Shiva down in one of his earliest appearences
