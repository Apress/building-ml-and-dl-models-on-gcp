From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued Things that I did huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free placed PD on subjects often providing the only pics to this day on the subjects in question hundreds of pages formatted according to standards huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it etc etc  and instead of helping me and being civil sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a noncontributing user who for no apparent reason started a campaign of open violent threats death threats spamming and vandalism on me You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation by modvandalizing discussions on the subject etc  against most other moderators private views even  they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject Your 500 page nerdopedia rulebook and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you Apparently you felt that since you had read it everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didnt  with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it no regard for that individuals contributions no regard for civility  and most of all with no common sense applied whatsoever

Its indeed too bad that most pages on nerdopedia are starting to be shockingy unmaintained and obsolete indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years and the fun is over for most people  as the most brutal blow of all moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here because of people like YOU and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here Its all about brownnosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins and youre just a wannabe 

Good ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time the latest tv show pages and some other obsessivecompulsive nerdishm Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job from people such as YOU

For example the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006 and since that they have well Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them as they left this site No updates Im truly not the only one to eject Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over if you ever need any help

Its kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too but given your attitude back then Im not surprised you did After all there were some decent admins here back then such as   and Im sure theres a few now but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives and they have to show it and snoop their noses everywhere But like I said as even admins are dropping out what do you think happened to the contributors Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details and newbies or worse malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant Admins will be happy to see updates to the page but the fact is most of the updates today are degenerating the pages obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage

And too bad you didnt quit a year ago I might still be here and there would probably be several thousands of lines and few hundred articles more along with maybe 1000 more photographs
Good riddance
