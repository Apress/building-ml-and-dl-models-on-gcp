In the language area the FYROM language is called  UNBELIEVABLE LIE  
This is fcking unbelievable Greece has never recognised the FYROM language as 
Not even all countries in the world has recognised FYROM as  to start with
This is a provokation for most of us Greeks and a HUGE HISTORICAL LIE to write that minorities in north Greece speak meaning the FYROM language especially in a Greece related article 
The citizens of FYROM have no historical connection with Ancient Makedonia and with Alexander the Great THEY ARE LIARS  

In the below links you will find some details of why we Greeks we will never recognise these Slavic falsifiers as
