I was there the night at the 100 club when Sid invented pogoing and he really did invent it  as he pogoed and came down he was smashing people with his elbows  we were off to the side but this caused the crowd to keep pushing into us  which made my cousin keep spilling his drink incidentally he was the guy in the Melody Maker photo throwing the punch at the Nashville pistols gig  this happened about three times and then my cousin exploded and hit Sid  the crowd parted and my cousinhis mate and me hiding behind had an empty bottle in his hand saying right whos first to all the punks who were thinking of having a go  well nothing happened and the crowd closed up cause my cousins mad when hes had a few lagers its the Irish in us  fracas over and next Sid Vicious comes up to us in the crowd and says to my cousin Hey do you wanna join my band to which my cousin told him to fck off
