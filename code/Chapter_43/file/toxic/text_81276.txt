I am violating wikipedia rules You denied me my nationality and insulted me on my own talk page because of my sociopolitical values I have not even discussed them with you you just saw me userboxes and you attacked me based on that Thats what I call a violation I think disciplinary action is more appropriate for harassers like you who are spreading stupidity and hate
