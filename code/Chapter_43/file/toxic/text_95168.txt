Who is Dreadstar and How is it that they are able to censor me 

So I log into Wikipedia one evening and find a few things worth commenting on  Suddenly all my edits are blocked by Dreadstar  Who is this censor  Why does he have the right to determine that what my opinions about particular edits on archeological topics are vandalism

WTF and who the heck is Dreadstar
