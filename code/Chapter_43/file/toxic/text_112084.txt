List of hoolie firms  Denmark 
Hello Removing mentions of firms such as Southside United one of the original firms in Denmark that actually is mentioned in the source albeit misspelled South Side United by some scummy journalist cunt whos research probably was two coppers and a google search while keeping Blue Front which could be seen as their youth group as well as Squad 92 which ALSO is mentioned in the source article does not make any sense whatsoever Removing CC Youth Division could make a bit more sense but the group is also mentioned in the article though as Young Boys which simply is an old name So please stop your amateurish sourcechecks where you remove firms that actually are mentioned in the given sources and are generally a fucking cunt Thank you in advance
