Again I never asserted the Greasemans death

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past I will post the relevant exchange here he gave removing vandalism as the reason for editing it out his only tool is a hammer perhaps so he sees me as a nail perhaps

Your Lies About Me

You wrote Final Warning

Saying things like DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER and Dont be a douche is a good way to get blockedfast Tone the language downand pay attention Greaseman aint dead If you continue to add continued now lies to Wikipedia I will report you to AIV and to your ISP Verizon Stop now this is your final warning  NeutralHomer  Talk 

Yes I did use the language on a talk page and if it will make the booboo feel better I apologize But who doesnt enjoy a nice summers eve

BUT you need to STOP LYING about me I never said the Greaseman was dead only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated Eve Otherwise perhaps it is I who shall report you Tell you what you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed Fair

Lets look at your odd writing style If you continue to add continued now lies to Wikipedia Just what are you going for there

Ive never put a lie on Wikipedia contrary to your assertion Anyone who lies about me can go screw

Your threat to report me to my ISP FOR WHAT EVE is beyond pathetic Two pops for yes Report away

Now the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion

Lets all remember shall we that I never said that Greaseman was dead simply that he was REPORTED DEAD  Theres a big difference and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did  THAT IS A LIE  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack under Wikipedia guidelines  Is this a separate but equal or separate and unequal system

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio  Lets look at Wikipedias entry on Cesar Romeros personal life shall we  There is NO source cited for his death nor his homosexuality yet those are all sensitive topics are they not  Why doesnt Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part

To recap I never lied  I never vandalized  That should be enough

Now lets look at Wikipedias reckless report of Cesar Romeros death and homosexuality shall we  Sensitive matters no

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christs kingdom would be very similar to Marxs envisionment of communism and held to this belief until his death12

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mothers side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí although his mothers parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime

Romero was never married despite proposing to at least one woman Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit usually in the company of an attractive actress and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a confirmed bachelor Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime

Romero wore a mans tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname Butch The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his onetime dancing partner Joan Crawford who teased Romero by telling him Youre so butch While Romeros homosexuality was an open secret in Hollywood the moviegoing public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994 He was interred at Inglewood
