WIKIPEDIA WILL BE DEAD IN 2 YEARS 

When the founder of a service hails it as being open source and a collective idea yet then wields the power of his service to close himself off from that which he idealises is full of hit and through these actions is destroying the very thing he created Pure hypocrisy Your service is DEAD in the water What you once purveyed and advertised has now been shown to be a sham  through your control over your own vain message SHAME on you but most of all shame on those who stupidly contributed to your so called philanthropic fund
