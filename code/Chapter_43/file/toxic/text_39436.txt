Please dont block me from editingplease Trust me my life doesnt revolve around editing pages in wikipedia like yours I couldnt give a flying shit on Sunday  Hope deleting peoples articles makes you feel better inside Just because you have yet to produce a quality page on this site doesnt mean you should be jealous of others and use that as the ONLY reason for getting rid of them Do something with yourself for Gods Sake Can you honestly look at your life right now and say Ive made a difference If not then leave the rest of us alone Thats my advice to you Dont be a fucking cynic You end up very lonely that way Maybe you should watch my show sometime to see what its like trying to be creative The address is Whatisjoppacom
