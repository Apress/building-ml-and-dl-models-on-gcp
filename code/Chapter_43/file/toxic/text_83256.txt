Telling someone to clean it up or go home for reverting to asinine edits seemingly done out of spite is uncivil  And you call yourself thickskinned

Since your original whinefest really was directed at me then I was too hasty in pulling back my piss off and ban me if you must comments  A simple review of the crap I get warned for by you is mroe than enough to tell me you have some bigger issue with me

So piss off and ban me if you must  

Ooopswas I being uncivil  And how big of a spiteful loser do you need to be to go back and look at the history of my talk page

Again piss off and ban me if you must  Wikipedia is getting annoying anyway particularly for someone trying to help 

Please delete my account  I wont bother providing good faith edits when I have liberal yes youre a liberal pricks breathing down my neck for partisan reasons
