Just like a Bangladeshi Couldnt even give me a response could you

I tried being polite didnt I I tried being civil But you people are all the same

Im in Bangladesh now you know As I said Dacca to be precise And youve been awfully free with information about yourself

You wouldnt want anything to happen to your filthy Bangladeshi family would you bucko

Answer me like a man or American justice is gonna get real over here Or dont you want to admit that youre just leeching off of the goodwill of the land of the free and the home of the brave
