Damn wiki admins 

What is it with all these wiki admins and THEM not being able to follow RULES and policies such as the NPOV 3RR and rules pertaining for VANDALISM

if anyone knows how i can get in touch directly with SENIOR Admins i would greatly appreciate it as some admins just make their owns rules up on the spot while disobeying wikipedias rules and effectivly slamming banhammers

and no im not talking about all admins but i am talking about quite a few admins
