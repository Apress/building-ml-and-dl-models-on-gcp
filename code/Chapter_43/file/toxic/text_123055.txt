So Hersford gets away with this  Because I stand up to this moral choice I get fucked over with two or three warnings on my page  Instead someone doesnt warn Hersford for his bad choice  Please note his long excuse filled statement on his page  Does that not read like an attack on me  I dont like to be attacked and he was caught for a big mistake so instead of immediately reconsidering his mistake he went on the attack  An ageold public relations ploy which I dont buy  Hersford may or may not be a racist but he certainly let an avowed racist get away with something  Sad   Talk Contributions
