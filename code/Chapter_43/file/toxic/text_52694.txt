What a sham HAHAHAHA

HAHAHAHA This is so funny 

That poor guy is totally flustered and confused
So I am just gonna let him go lol
I doubt if he is in a state to understand anything anymore It will only confuse him further lol

He actually inadvertently helped me lol I wanted to close those superflous accounts anyway LOL

The admins involved are misinformed and confused too policy understanding and applicability went for a toss even when the policy is quite explicit But never mind them lol I guess they cant be expected to spend their time to go thru ALL messages carefully to really and actually understand a situation so they just act willynilly and haphazardly

BTW If that guy calls me a Vandal then I WILL call and consider him a TROLL And he knows that lol Perhaps I should have followed the policy of not feeding the troll lol

He started the issue Why does he get so worked up then

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA He cant take it HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

LOL

Anyway Sue I am gonna be quite busy Important stuff coming up
I am really going to enjoy

Will log in only after quite a while Have a few ideas which can change the technical and general policy of wiki in a very fundamental way Will have to chat with the concerned guy at wiki

Anyway you too have fun Sue

Enjoy

That guy sure amused me muchly LOL HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
