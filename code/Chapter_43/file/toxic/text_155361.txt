What a complete crock  By calling everyone under the age of 18 a child which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil  Teenagers are insulted to be called children and if you start using terms like teenage sex and teenage sex with adults to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better the poor little abused children angle is more difficult to sell  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme and legally define everyone under 18 as a baby  Then all sex with minors could be poor little babies being abused and raped which would no doubt please the Judith Reismans John Ashcrofts and David Finkelhors of the world  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as perpetuating the abuse what you have is pseudoscience and flimflam and not unbiased reporting 2010
