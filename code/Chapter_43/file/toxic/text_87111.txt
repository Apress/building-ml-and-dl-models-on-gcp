Please refrain from undoing other peoples edits repeatedly If you continue you may be blocked from editing Wikipedia Note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions in a content dispute within a 24 hour period Additionally users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule Rather than reverting discuss disputed changes on the talk page The revision you want is not going to be implemented by edit warring Thank you PTO
