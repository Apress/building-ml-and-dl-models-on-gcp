Is it worth it all 

Is it worth all this admin and editor effort trying to trace block ban editors who only post minor annoying to some questions at the Ref desks I think not What i do think is that you and your ilk just enjoy hunting so called trolls even though they do no damage to the encyclopedia proper You make insignificant edits to the pedia so I conclude you are not a real Wikipedian Before you level the same accusations at me you will remember that I am banned but you could look up my history of contributions if you wanted to  Why dont you find another game off wiki to waste your time
I have surcived all attacks on me many of them by Admins in the past few years  None could shut me up Neither will you Even TWAT features has given up
I promised trouble if I was banned for the minor offence of arguing with admins I am keeping my promise The only way to stop me is to deny my existence totally But you wont do that bvcause you enjoy this form of blood sport dont you Why not go out and shoot a few rabbits insted endnig with yourself
THe one and only LC
