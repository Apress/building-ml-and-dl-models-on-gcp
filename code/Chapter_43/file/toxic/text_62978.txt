Another ridiculous article by WikiPedia 

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles Area is easy to define It is the product of two averages Volume is not analogous to area  whoever wrote this needs to look up the word analogous Volume is defined as the product of three averages It is also accurate to say that area has no extent  just like a point or line Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent As an example If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent its length is zero If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same then the line has length of 3 units More ridiculous articles Fundamental theorem of Calculus Proof that 0999  1 and Infinitesimals 981952426
