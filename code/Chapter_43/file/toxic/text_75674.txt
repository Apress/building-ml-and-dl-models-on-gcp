Idk who you are and wtf you think you are running your cing mouth but I believe you need to respect peoples opinions and paying attention on which divisions had the now retired C40HF buses  FYI they only have been at division 3 for a short time before they were transferred to divisions 5 and 7 for almost their life until some from D5 were sent to D18 to take the Neoplans places in the early 2010s while some from D5 were sent to D7 due to the delivery of a few Nabi 45Cs lower 8600s and later the delivery of the Xcelsiors several months ago Maybe you need to do your research and quit trying to bash people you dont know off I suggest you run along before you get yourself in trouble inferior
