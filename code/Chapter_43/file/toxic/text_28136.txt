I find Jpgordons claims to be bogusnone of those are personal attacks as they are not addressed to any specific person  Furthermore I now have doubts about the intentions of Jpgordon as he has refused to block Canderra despite Canderras violation of the 3rr rule 4 reverts in 24 hours  See revert 1 and 4 compared  httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleChe_Guevaradiff39908363oldid39772586

I also think it is a bit suspect that 2 other leftists editors jump on board immediatly following my block and work to revert and discuss once Im goneand find it a bit more suspect that these leftists and jpgordon accuse some anonymous ip address as being metalk about good faith

Canderras claims are idiotic at best  I am not surprised that the leftists dont care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them

Saying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs  Not one source is a blog  The New York Sun USA Today Frontpage Magazine Florida International University History News Network and the Independent Research InstituteARE NOT BLOGS  Canderra is just making up excuses to delete information he does not like and the leftists sycophants are working to have me blocked while ignoring Canderras and others abuses  Gibby
