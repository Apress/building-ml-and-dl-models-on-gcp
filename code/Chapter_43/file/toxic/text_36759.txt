personal attack by Travis 

Once again no one cares about your fascist behaviour haha And the only ones who have nationalistic problems are you and your buddy If you ever bothered to check your facts youd know it happens to be only known coin in the world that depicts olive so hence the relevance And yes it is trivia and same argument can be used for Bible since the same article mentions olives being noted in Bible but you didnt delete that part didnt you So stop pretending that you are some impartial supreme power on this site and get a life And any normal person following this bickering will see my edit has nothing do with vandalism and that your and your buddys personal attacks on me speak for itself Only difference it I dont care about being blocked So do your best
