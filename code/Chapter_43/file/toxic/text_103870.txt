Evils of Atheism

Its about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine and before you ask I do not generalize I think theres a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades Nonbelievers in general  say someone whos raised a Christian believes the Bible is an allegory and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime  tend to adopt a Whatever gets you through the night philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith Its sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat Atheists are proud of their hate It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians
