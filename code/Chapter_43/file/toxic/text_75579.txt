Dear Wikipedia assholes

I regret to inform you that because of deletionist scum such as Gavin Collins and J Milburn I am planning to terminate my life You see Wikipedia was my life and these deletionist bastards have ruined and deleted everything that I have worked so very hard to create I spent over three years contributing to Wikipedia improving the site sacrificing grades in school to add to a revolutionary encyclopedia but because of these lowlife dipshits whom I abhor in every molecule of my body I have discovered that it was all for nothing So I end my life and I hope this will bring the wrath and resentment of the world down upon these deletionist jackasses

Sincerely
Vern Cork
