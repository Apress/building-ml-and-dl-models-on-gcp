The various local government areas pages only list them  I was thinking something like that  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote they can be incorporated into the article  

The states and territories run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government local councils  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis in different states the local councils have different powers  Though generally they provide water sewerage and look after local roads with the states looking after health education police and so on

Tasmania like the other states has a constitution  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament not a referendum  This constitution among other things establishes local government in Part IVA  Local Government Tasmanian Constitution  However this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the Parliament  from time to time Tasmanian Constitution  It is the Local Government Act 1993 referred hereafter to as either the LGA or the act that currently provides for the creation of the various councils the role of the councillors what power the councils have and so on  

The act requires that the various councils provide for the health safety and welfare of the community represent and promote the interests of the community and provide for the peace order and good government of the municipal area  Generally the act permits councils to do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area  Specifically the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers among others to charge land rates service rates special rates and to levy fines in relation to bylaws and to make bylaws in respect to anything the council has power to do
 Im sure the other states have similar legislation   Fuck you
