Will Arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks  

I fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this Bible article a full fledged onesided POV job with insulting inflammatory and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously   There is only one way to get this travesty to end and that is with more level of arbitration  We know there are antiChristian and antiJewish bigots in the world always have been no doubt about that  Why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance nonstop The way these sad sacks look at Christians and Jews whom they always label with derogatory sounding labels like fundamentalist and conservative  is reminiscent of the way Hitler felt about Jews except these mental dwarfs include Christians as well involving a much greater proportion of the population as their target  They are poisoning the environment with their bigotry This is a plea to arbitration for remedy  talk
