Lofton wrote AD while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid

Of course plenty of wayward students have had their financial aid renewed after having missed classes for far less substantial reasons so one wonders why was it so important for me to be dismissed 

Because of your grades dumb ass You can miss classes and still get good grades if your competent

the first and only of AD printing consisted of two thousand copies

Wow that must have sold in record time A whole two thousand your almost as famous as Steven King Dorksickle

I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year

Somehow I doubt that since it was published in 1998 and you were still hawking it to Tim Boucher in 2006
