Removing all or significant parts of pages content without any reason or replacing entire pages with nonsense Sometimes important verifiable references are deleted with no valid reasons given in the summary However significant content removals are usually not considered to be vandalism where the reason for the removal of the content is readily apparent by examination of the content itself Quoth the WikiVand which youve quoted numerous times without actually reading the fucking thing im removing dubious unverifiable content and you call this vandalism Lolfailure
