FANBOYISM 
it seems that some gma die hard fans or gma hired promoters are keeping on removing the the negative aspect of the showalthough a kapuso myself if you cant afford to build your own zaido fan site stop bugging down wikipedia study hard work hard and maybe someday you can host your own extravagant zaido fan site lol
the vocal uproar from shaider fans is too much to just be ignored and just deleted
if your talking about references then
Its much better to just remove this entire article because its not properly referenced either
talking about references try gooling Zaido remember google the 1 search engine and see the results youll see about 20 gargantuan negative comments vs 1 good comment about zaido its overwhelming no wonder this article was quickly vandalized zaido is really PHENOMENAL lol
the truth is exceedingly obvious ZAIDO SCKS Eat with it sleep with it live with it
thats all Be honest ok God is watching Godbless
