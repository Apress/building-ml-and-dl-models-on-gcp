horribly curse us
               Christians as Lyra also writes and from that draws the
               conclusion that they must not be the people of God

                                          

               Now behold what a nice thick fat lie it is when they
               complain about being captives among us Jerusalem was
               destroyed more than 1400 years ago during that time we
               Christians have been tortured and persecuted by the Jews in all
               the world On top of that we do not know to this day what
               Devil brought them into our country We did not fetch them
               from Jerusalem Yes we have and hold them captive as I
               would like to keep my rheumatism and all other diseases and
               misfortunes who must wait as a poor servant with money and
               property and everything I have I wish they were in hell
               with the other Jews and whomsoever they would like to have
               with them
