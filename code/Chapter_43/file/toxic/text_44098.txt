Reply to On gender 

Your posted Dont guess at someones gender as you have done here  It is uncivil and could in fact be taken as insult  Any argument you might have that their name appears to be that of a femalewoman is invalid as you have no idea if that is their name last name middle name etc  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book dÎ±lus Contribs 

If you know your friends gender spit it out you stupid ass Your entire posting if you didnt have the agenda I ascribe to you infra would have been FYI Heshe is a femalemale and I would adjust accordingly Hell if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium and Id refer to Dayewalker as theyit Dont continue to be an ass if you post further or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago I saw that afterwards I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation Thanks Dayewalker talk 0648 13 July 2010 Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment so that he Dayewalker is not guessing at his gender the subject of her Dayewalkers comment when he only refers to he or that he Dayewalker has genetic evidence that the he is actually a she and she Dayewalker is insulting them by suggesting that the he is too ballsy or pushy to be a womanlady Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as she or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as she Dont be an ass

If Dayewalker or anyone is so concerned about their gender identification and they are not an idiot they will use a prefix like Mr or Ms Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion If you wish to join into the discussion please feel free On second thought dont join in I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either Dayewalker he she they etc doesnt answer his question Ut oh now Ive called Chowbok a he No doubt her boyfriendgirlfriend will rush in to call me a beast and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a sissy or a girlie then she can address that with me He doesnt need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned And by protector I mean you You are an ass Male Female Both Neither And of whatever sexual orientation if any that you wish to use to identify yourself or not identify yourself or feel the need to identify yourself or feel the need to keep private or over which you do not care I dont care what gender if any you himherthemit are
