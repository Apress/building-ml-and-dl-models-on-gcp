Jack and Jill 

Hey jackass dont protect that page  You are taking the fun all out of it  

 Jack and Jill went up a hill
 Each with a buck and a quarter
 Jill came down with two fifty
 oh what a whore

Alan who knew your momma was named Jill

OK I am off to vandalise something else  Catch me if you can
