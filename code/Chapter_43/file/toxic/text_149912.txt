Calling someone daft is a WPNPApersonal attack and bullshit warnings is likewise uncollegial so I recommend that you calm down and redact yourself I also reserve the right to leave appropriate templates on your talk page as is required of me
If you read WPSPS which I did youll find that it explicitly makes an exception for experts in the field like Callahan You also didnt deny that BLP is irrelevant
I believe Ive clearly shown that you are wrong on the basis of policy so Im asking you again to revert yourself and avoid sanctions
