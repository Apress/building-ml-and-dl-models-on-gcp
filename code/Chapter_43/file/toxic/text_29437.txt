Who you think you are 
Admin  Editor 
IF I will do the same on ALL your contributions lets see if you like it a 
FIRST ASK second DOCUMENT yourself third YOU ARE NOT GOD to do what you want based on your intuitions  You saw 78 added links from ALL my work and you act like crazy  This is SPAM  Beside i DONT HAVE ANY intention to promote ANY site i even remove when i see broken links etc 

So STOP Judging and act stupidly 
You want to chace SPAM LOOK HERE  these are websites with thousands of links in wikipedia and no one does anything from different STUPID reasons like  is a notable source  so WHAT  this is giving rights to pages like livescience or europeanaeu httpsenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleSpecial3ASearchprofileallsearchEuropeanaeufulltextSearch

So CHECK FIRST act AFTER you have proves
