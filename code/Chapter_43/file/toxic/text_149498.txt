Ive only taken a cursory look at the article but it looks like you made a good point  I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season and Id agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category Regardless if you plan on making more edits like this and this you might find yourself with a block extension Bbb23s a good administrator and 3RRs called  brightline rule for a reason And considering that editwarring blocks are to get users to cool down if this is how you responded it looks like he made the right call  Je vous invite à me parler
