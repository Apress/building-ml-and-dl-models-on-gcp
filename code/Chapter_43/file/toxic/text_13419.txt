I reverted the armor section back to describing all the armors you can unlock because I think it is an interesting topic to have and because this article needs more information   
Wikipedia is not a gameguide  

Possibly the dumbest argument I have ever heard Are all wikipedia users fags or just you The Wikipedia is not a gameguide retardedness doesnt even apply here Its not telling you how to unlock the armors just what they are Or should we delete the characters and stories too THOSE ARE IN GAME GUIDES Fucking moron Well look at it now Now it should be fine with you right fucking faggot   

Take a chill pill My mistake perhaps it should have been no game trivia item 6 instead Also your revision You can also unlock several armors I would list them but wikipedia users are total fags and think it doesnt belong in the article Sorry is in the wrong prose 1st person doesnt really contribute to the article violates npa and is misleading its guidelines that state it shouldnt be in the article so I reverted it Thanks  

I dont care Unless you remove the entire bonus features portion of the article the armor information is related to the article   

Theres a minor reference to the unlockable armors in the article I think thats all thats needed for the moment anyway Thanks
