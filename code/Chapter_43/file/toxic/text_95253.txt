And for those reasons I despise China as well as the politically correct

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wikis page on the controversial word niggardly that stupid people and words do not mix It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language As I said idiots and words can be a dangerous combination

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wikis niggardly page and was accused of vandalism yet others posted similar comments I must of hit a nerve with some idiots who dont have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage LOL
