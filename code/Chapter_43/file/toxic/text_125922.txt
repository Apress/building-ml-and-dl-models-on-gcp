Cantor was born in St Petersburg which last time I checked was in RUSSIA  and lived there for 11 years  while you insist  after repeated attempts by me to edit and correct your FALSE claims  you have cowardly now blocked edits  the fact remains  Georg Cantor was and will ALWAYS be a RUSSIAN national  you amaze me at your ignorance to try to claim him for Germany  I do not care if he obtained German citizenship or not  he is RUSSIAN  period  stop the false claims  if you were so sure of yourself you would allow edits and see how many times I insist to correct YOUR errors  you do the mathematics community a disservice and your edit blocks PROVE you are in the wrong  the TRUTH remains  Georg Cantor was RUSSIAN  period  correct it damn it
