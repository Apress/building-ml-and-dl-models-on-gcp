Oh and here is the response I posted that got erased 

REDVEÐ¯S I do not feel my comments are poisonous Other people agree with me The good editor you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used As far as I know most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting What I find disgusting are his insensitive uncaring and simply awful author photos and the egotistical ways he defends them
And here is my response to you David Shankbone Theres a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper vs having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her as anyone can see in the history of her page and it wasnt until you used intimidation on a talk page I think by implying she shouldnt even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked that she immediately backed down and got friendly clearly out of fear that you would block her Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 talk  contribs
