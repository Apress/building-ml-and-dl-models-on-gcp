Hey everybody FYI dont bother posting on Scalzis website He deletes posts critical of himself and hell do it over and over That guy he describes on his bio is pretty much the opposite of him he hates confrontation except on his own terms and cant handle criticism In fact he will go to great lengths to hide it from others all that crap about liking to argue is pretty ridiculous The only thing thats true about that page is probably that he does indeed taunt people however he seems to have a problem handling the type of shit he dishes out So stick to his page here where at least the facts arent relative to Scalzis ego
