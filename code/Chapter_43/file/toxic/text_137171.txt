You are an atrocious liar Bob Rayner If I wrote in the valueform article I created that Thus Marx aims to provide a brief morphology of the category of economic value as such from the simplest forms to the moneyform that is perfectly accurate and neutral Because that is in fact what it is It is not controversial at all By contrast your arbitrary vandalism of others texts has nothing to do with accuracy and neutrality but with your own perceptions biases and prejudices what is acceptable or preferable You are fighting your own propaganda war in wikipedia as shown exactly by what you deleted and added across time Thats bad but what makes it worse is two things the evidence is that you frequently have no real experience or competency with regard to the subjectmatter and you provide no satisfactory explanations or discussions for cutting out very large parts of texts from articles written by others I am therefore going to launch an arbitration procedure against you as soon as I get some time Your highly objectionable political vendetta in wikipedia disguised as editing ought to stop forthwith
