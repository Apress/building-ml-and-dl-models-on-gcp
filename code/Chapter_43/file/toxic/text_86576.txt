Wrong information 

In the article it claims all 20 of the sites three million gallon capacity tanks are on fire
This is not correct Both the MP for Hemel Hampstead and the poilce sercvices have said that there are more exploisions expected from so far unaffected tanks and the BBC coverage has even shown the unexploded tanks
I think it is sickening that you have inserted this misleading information into this article which details a terrible event
Shame on you
