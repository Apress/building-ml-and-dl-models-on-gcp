First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you dont understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real peoples encyclopaediais called Google Either you dont understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you dont care I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle I dont think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldnt have to pay you to supress the truth You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police I am sure things will happen but since you havent got any interest in updating it none will report it here I dont believe it is helpful either Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome I am sending her Hard Times if you havent read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant It is far from accurate or up to date Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit Before I began editing wiki hadnt updated info for several years No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent
