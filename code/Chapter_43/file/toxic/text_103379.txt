Reply to Alison  An ATHEIST deals with topics such as Lingam and approves someone like Buddhipriya who remains silent for a while and suddenly revamps whole article guerilla warfare disregarding all discussions done and starts with the same old questionsThere is quite an alliance of all u racist whites Well CIRCUMCISED SPIRITUAL LOSERS commonion

Reply to Lunarian  And someone like Lunarian talks about Sanathana Sarati on discussion page of LingamBoss there is not only Sarathi there is also a Sanathana destroyer of all evils Look out for it

Reply to dab
Insisting to call mainstream academic view which is decisive for Wikipedia like it or not Western is a tendentious red herring used by those who have otherwise no case or no patience to build it   by user dab in Lingam discussion 
My reply Which mainstream are you talking about
All those anglicised dictionaries cannot adjudge the worthiness of the symbol since there are hundreds of words which can never be described by EnglishThats a limitation of EnglishNow u will ask evidences for thatStupid fellow  English was never a primary language of India and will never be in near future and no proper scholar will ever write in English just to put on wiki If you dont care for cross cultural sensitivity then let be ur nonsense prevail on wiki since I think its completely for English readers and not for all and what I thought about wiki being sensitive and complete would become a mythTry these things on christianity  you will be hammered and that too on first two paras  never  shows ur intolerence and u talk about my tolerence Its all peeled off white here on wiki great sense of prostitution and inferiority complex God save thee
