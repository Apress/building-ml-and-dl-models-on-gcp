I still operate in that bizarre subset of the world where actions speak stronger than words  Deleting content is the work of a true asshole  Calling someone an asshole in a talk page is just an observation  Further 99 of wikipedia lacks citation and is not encyclopedic  Saying that it is not relevant to the article is grand but you yourself admitted that there would be an article where it would be appropriate  Therefore move it to that article or accept the status quo  You dont go around deleting stuff just because youre too lazy to do what you have already admitted the right thing is unless you are you guessed it an asshole
