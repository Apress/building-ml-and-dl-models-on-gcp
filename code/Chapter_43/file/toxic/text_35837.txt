Bullshit His corkscrew senton finisher hasnt been called the Cancun Tornado Why the fuck would you argue if you dont have your facts straight Watch iDia de los Dangerous I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesnt matter For example in wrestling for years and years the name Last Call was synonymous with a fallaway slam but that didnt stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick Sometimes two different moves have the same name The guys name is Human Tornado and apparently they thought that the move name Cancun Tornado fit his characters name even though the move wasnt a corkscrew moonsault PWG has named the move multiple times and therefore it should be in the article
