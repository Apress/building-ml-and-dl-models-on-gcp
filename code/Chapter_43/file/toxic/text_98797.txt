Sorry Poking Baiting What is this crap Im trying to have a serious conversation with Malleus that was rudely interrupted by a triggerhappy admin blocking Malleus midsentence Malleus is perfectly capable of answering for himself here I dont know who youre patronising more here with that Im getting the message that Malleus has no response to the obvious humiliation him editing that mans biography represents Is humiliation or hurt a likely response to that Malleus If you do concede that what makes it right for you to insult and humiliate him and edit his page Its a serious not a rhetorical question Its a moral question
