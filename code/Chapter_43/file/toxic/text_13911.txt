Deleting Pop This Whole Place Open 

Excuse me but what the fuck do you think youre doing I posted a page on here for my band Pop This Whole Place Open and you promptly deleted it What is the meaning of this debauchery Wikipedia is clearly a website used to provide information What harm comes from posting a page about my band It was completely truthful and I am just trying to make a name for myself Who do you thin you are deleting this page You go around judging peoples contributions to other pages about popular subjects and that is perfectly fine but who the fuck are you to tell me that the information that I posted about my own band isnt worthy of being on Wikipedia Huh Who would better be the authority on the subject than I I ought to find you and expose my penis to you You asshole are nothing but a whore A whore who thinks they have some kind of say in the matters of life What if we became famous Then there would be a page on here about us and you wouldnt be deleting it But since we are some band youve never heard of that makes it okay to delete our page You must be some high authority in the music business that I dont know about I must have insulted your intelligence by making a page which only I could possibly contain all the knowledge to Regardless of the reason that you deleted my page let me tell you something Schmegma Von Dicksuckington you can fuck yourself long and hard with a baseball bat covered in barbed wire How dare you delet my page Bring it back to Wikipedia within the hour or I will continue to post insulting things on your talk page you ergonomic keyboard using alternative MP3 player owning fuck

I hope you get cancer 
And if you or a close relative of yours already has cancer good

Fuck you
