This is ridiculous It makes Iranians look stupid Who the fuck are you A political commentator An outspoken selfproclaimed expert on contemporary Iranian politics Oh right my penname is The Persian Cataphract so let me try to decipher your next tactical move The race card Oh right your names not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson Let me guess the next one Nationalist Thats right youll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message in favour of this preconceived strawman fallacy and red herring Youll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity I just must be nothing else than this lionandsun foamatmouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality And certainly I must be dumb as you so eloquently have arbitrated above

You said it yourself right here

I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for singletopic povpushing Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism A user called IranianGuy or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter Who for that matter do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism an editor called AraratArev vel sim

Is that how you assess content By making a shallow assumption on pennames Expectations The Godgiven right to anonymity on the Internet How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator What next are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iranrelated articles Indeed not just a laughable policy but indeed a dangerous one as well Most of the worldclass authorities are Iranians With your fucked up logic we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content youll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection Oh right youre Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization youre obviously this stereotypical neutralist Good lord listen to yourself 

Luckily academia doesnt work like that Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated So it doesnt really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a selfdeclared outspoken Nazi Communist Socialist Liberal Conservative or what have you it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content Thats NPOV A sober neutral objective approach just barebones bareknuckles source critique Source Critique Make an assessment on the content not the persons You marginalized IranianGuy Period And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his penname you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach No matter what country or penname or real name you have it has a universal stamp Asshole behaviour
