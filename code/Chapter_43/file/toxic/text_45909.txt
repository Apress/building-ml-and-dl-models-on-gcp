Primary sources are generally not acceptable  Bwa ha ha ha ha ha  Seriously  Are you completely stoned or drunk  You are certainly not a researcher historian or even a student to make such a ridiculous and derelict statement  Indeed you expose yourself to ridicule scorn and certainly to the laughter of ANY serious student writer and certainly to the Titanic community  We will start with my personal Facebook page and go from there  Too bad for you that you cant delete your illadvised and stupid remark  And no doubt about it it was stupid beyond any means of defense
