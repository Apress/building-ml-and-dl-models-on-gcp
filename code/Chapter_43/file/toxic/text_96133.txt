Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership and here is why The managers are not in charge of the store the hourly associates are they take orders directly from the customers The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year this survey is a rating of each manager and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP then changes are made Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates and so it is kinda a pushpull managment system Take my own situation for an example heres what happend one night I am short of assocates in the deliwhich is where I work Temp logs did not get done of course this is a major mistake I was written up for this However I did not feel this was fair so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP Our VP came to our store flew in from bentonville mind you To deal with the situation he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short would be on probation for the next six months I was satisfied with the outcome Because While I was not fault free in the situation management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership 

Also Cash I hate the way you term vast leftwing conspiracy I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal that would be your union leaders and rightwing large business owners that are antiwalmart As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you rightwingers Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters vote on the liberal side this does not mean that they are liberals just that they play the politics game True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you lol

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the AntiWalmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits its a freaking joke the way they act However I have just taken on the Idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of BS it is
