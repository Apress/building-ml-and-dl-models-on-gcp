And not arguing semantics is the last defence of someone who knows they are wrong or wont admit they are wrong If I understand AGK correctly he believes I was attempting to be malicious He assumed I was saying something that I wasnt trying to Instead of saying it was not constructive which is untrue and not blockable he backed his block by implying that I meant something I did not There are no semantics about it AGK simply does not believe me when I say it was simple wordplay So how about you go tell everyone in that section that it was not collaborative It obviously was since they responded AGK is the one who had a kneejerk reaction to it All that was needed was Dude cancer can be taken the wrong way Strike it or get blocked Instedd he waited until HOURS after I had edited to make a 24 hour block So dont argue semantics with me Jusitify your poor reaction Not punitive my ass  0130
