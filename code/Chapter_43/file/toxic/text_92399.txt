This entire article is a biased piece of shit 
OKsomebody help me out herebut can you tell who really won this war by reading the article in its entirety Be you Jew or Muslim or PaganI challenge you  No You cant  Even  though we meaning anybody with an IQ of 20 who has been reading USA Today for the past few years all know the IDF got a bloody nose of sorts in this campaign and surely werent boasting about how things went  

the fact that the IDF got a smack down by Hezbollah should be clearly stated in the main article  It isntwhich reflects the ongoing glaring weakness of Wikipedia in general factual accuracy plays second fiddle to concerted efforts to rewrite history by collective entities  This Lebanon War Wiki entry is a classic example of this  Israel clearly lost this campaign but you can read the entire article and really not know who won  

what a disservice Wikipedia is  It is almost pernicious as this medium is so easily hijacked by special interests who pervert the truth to serve their own special interests
