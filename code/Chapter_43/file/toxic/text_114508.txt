Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information Espionage is inherently clandestine as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the tradecraft used to collect this information

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as SunTzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion Chanakyas student Chandragupta Maurya founder of the Maurya Empire made use of assassinations spies and secret agents which are described in Chanakyas Arthasastra The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence and the Hebrews used spies as well as in the story of Rahab Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence More recently spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England see Francis Walsingham Many modern espionage methods were well established even then httpwwwhenrywottonorguk

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China and their allies particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets Recently espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others The former Soviet Union for example preferred  human sources over  research in open sources while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT Both Soviet political KGB and military intelligence GRU
  officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge There are exceptions to physical meetings such as the Oslo Report or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information

The US defines espionage towards itself as The act of obtaining delivering transmitting communicating or receiving information about the national defense with an intent or reason to believe that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792798 and Article 106 Uniform Code of Military Justicecite web
