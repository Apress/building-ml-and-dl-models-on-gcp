His edits do suck which is why I reverted them over and over again  Not one edit contributed positively to the article and most served the needs of the Crusaders  In any case Ive pointed out that my comment about him sucking was reverted by me immediately  It is my practice to write honestly then go back and edit myself before submitting  In this I missed one spot and had to edit it after submitting as I mentioned in my edit comment  Since nobody saw the original unless they dug through the history and since nobody ever needed to warn me about it your excuses are nonsense  You just wanted to silence me so I couldnt defend myself from the ideologicallymotivated 3RR violation report

Even before you got a badge you have made it a practice to litter my user page with spurious warnings which has earned you the honor of being the only person whose text I erase on sight from my Talk page  You are a stalker

Since you are the guilty party your response here is not sufficient  I would like an objective third party to respond regarding this abusive block by you
