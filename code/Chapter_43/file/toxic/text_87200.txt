Mgnbar What is a stupid act 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree
I dont think Wikipedia have redefined the word consensus even if they try to redefine the word consensus it doesnt matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid Or if my work pictures theories references text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures text and theories Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures theories and text 
The question is if its ok to use your own scientific work in WikipeidaThe answer is YesFor example It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you cant give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same picturesBut do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isnt based on his or her own knowledge including research

And according to Wikipedia rules if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesnt want my report as a reference they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk pageIf the reference is found to be wrong Then all the information pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling wear and Stressmechanics must be deleted Because my contributions are closely linkt to my researchGod luck with deleting all my contributions  I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake
