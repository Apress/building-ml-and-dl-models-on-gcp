You are a Putz just because you do not know about the Moss Bluff Strike Force does not mean its a hoax You were probably never in the military and you write about military history so I ask you who is the hoax  Why dont you go write and article about a battle that you read about in a book that was written by a guy who wasnt close enough to smell the gun powder and then tell me what a hoax is You are pathetic
