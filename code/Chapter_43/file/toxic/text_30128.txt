It is neither more historically correct nor more professional Scholars routinely use the term Nazi You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim But in fact the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism In the online version of the Encyclopedia there are 10200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to National Socialism And in the title of the entry for National Socialism they write also called Nazism or Naziism 

Your claim that use of the term Nazi is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term The claim that National Socialism is a more full and correct designation is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous And while it is true that Nazi can be used as an epithet so can dog Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word dog to describe dogs 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term Nazi rather than National Socialist throughout his book I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents
