Listen chump 

not only have you acted in collusion with Willmcw but you have behaved badly I would use stronger language but I dont think that it is appropriate here I will say this it is obvious to me and to my advocate that though you assume what Willmcw says to be true the edits I made were in fact worthy and not only will your reply be redirected to my advocate but also to a host of otehr administrators This has become such a trying time that Ive been granted the ability to switch to a new identity and leave your vicious attacks behind You have proven to be a slimy loose moralled child who spends too much time at wikipedia tryong to bully others out of the edits you have only taken up since this July Whihc translates to the fac that your job at 23 leaves you such an amount of free time that you can sling insults and barbs online rather than actually do positive work at Wikipedia Whereas my edits may not have been as substantial as your own my sockpuppetry related to willmcw or at least buddying upo wiht him has not been as pervasive as your own Im leaving Im fed up with the typical acne faced loser who cant get a date with a woman or a man and so spends his time in front of his computer screen making alliances with other awkward socially malnourished dweebs who  can think of nothing better than to try an interact only thorugh the computer You do a disservice to all computer geeks everywhere by trying to be more intelligent than others because the lack of your vision seeps through the anger you display for all to see Any true hacker knows that the way you have taking stands here has opened you up for retribution as I am nnot a hacker I wont work on such matters in negative aspects But you should be mindful that youve made a strong mess here and no matter what your own opinon is oyu should learn manners and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites Loser
