LOL what a load of unsourced unscientific bullcrap 
What about making this article more scientific so people can actually use it There is no technical info  Come on it doesnt take an university degree to describe it Its merely selective breeding it is well documented and has been practiced for 1000s of years with animals It shouldnt be hard to describe the science behind it as the mechanisms are exactly the same with humans There are no principal differences between breeding an intelligent search dog and an intelligent human the method is the same 93161107169
