Article reorganization 

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality  I think this article should be worded more like the homosexuality article which distinguishes between homosexual orientation and samesex relationships  Likewise there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear  For example it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex not from a heterosexual orientation  On the other hand the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation  That crucial element isnt clear I am going to start reorganizing it like the homosexuality page
