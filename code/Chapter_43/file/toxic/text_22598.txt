Your accusations are false and malicious You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me not by me You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent CleanKeeper Yet you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me including the repeated use of the F word by The Magnificent CleanKeeper towards me There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation That is outrageous The mediator turned out to have a srong bias He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator in my opinion To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site and that is the exact point I have tried to make BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutors brief But to me the worst part is to see the condoning of abuse of a woman editor That is so sickening it is beyond what I am willing to tolerate even to try to help achieve NPOV in an article
