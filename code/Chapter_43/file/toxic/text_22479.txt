RE Your last comment
It you want to end our interaction stop leaving comments on my talk page I find it laughable that you quote policies at me when you have been found guilty by the community of flagrantly breaching policies and punished by having your powers removed What moral authority do you think you can possibly have when your reputation is in tatters If I were you I would learn to keep my mouth shut a bit more rather than trying to moralise and stir up more problems If you can ever rebuild you reputation it will not be by harassing me You say you cant let it lie until I do but expect me to let it lie when you wont  do you know how ridiculous that sounds Please grow up and leave me alone
