No real contributions I point out the fact that objective scientists and realworld experience make a mockery of your sexist views of female sexuality I point out that your sexist puttering around in a Yugo nonsense is refuted by my own realworld experience I point out that the sex change industry THRIVES upon your sort of ridiculous sexist stereotypes Not only do lots of people take my comments seriously Im on the phone now with a colleague who agrees wholeheartedly with my views In fact shes seriously considering posting some thoughts here Ive readheard these very same opinions from many many people But go ahead keep telling yourself that Im the only who sees through your sexist nonsense
