Get a life 

Look saddo I dont know who you are but you know get a life To be honest does it matter that much that I dont know a website where what was said was said and let me assure you The Times newspaper is a fairly reliable source in my book 

Do you have a job Because the kind of person who checks every page for edits and their reliability is a pretty sad little man or woman I dont know what yamla is

Before you say anything or cite me for blocking or some crap this profile was only made because the school ip was blocked and I edited a page about the Crusades Happy
