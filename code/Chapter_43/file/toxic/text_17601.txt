In 1930 Balbo also did not fly into St Petersburg Mumbai or Ho Chi Minh City because those cities were not called that in 1930 either
If Balbo had flown in 1990 he would have flown into Derry per your petty policy What sort of city needs a stupid policy like this he asked rhetorically Ok Have you got it now
But this is not 1990 its 1930
If you dont understand the difference why are you working on an encyclopedia
Eh Eh
Quit wasting my time with this bullshit
Bullshit is what you are pushing Bullshit
Got it Jesus H Christ
