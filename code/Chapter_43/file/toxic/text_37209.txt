CLIMATE PLEASE 

What IDIOT suggested Russell Kansas has a humid subtropical climate There is no way in hell Russell Kansas could be classified as humid subtropical It is either humid continental or semiarid steppe and I would lean toward the latter since this part of Kansas is not nearly as humid and does not receive near the rainfall as the eastern half of the state If Kansas Citywhich is at the same latitude as Russellis classified as humid continental there is no earthly reason why Russell which is nearly five derees farther WEST in longitude can be humid subtropical
