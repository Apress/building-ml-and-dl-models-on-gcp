Who gives a rats ass what either Korea or Japan think about an English naming convention  Last I checked neither nation is comprised of native English speakers and they dont get a vote in what native Englishspeaking nations decide to call this body of water IN ENGLISH  We can call it the Sea of Jello and there isnt a damned thing they can do about it other than whine like babies  Perhaps in commemoration of this foolishness we should call it the Sea of Idiots and have done with it
