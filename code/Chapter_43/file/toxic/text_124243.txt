Answer to MÃ¼tze
You dare contacting your friend the administrator Andrew Norman who dares blocking me from carrying on my discussion on the discussion page of Bosendorfer

And now you would want to propose your modifications People with agenda like you I do NOT want to speak to them

Ask your accomplice Andrew Norman to unblock me and I will discuss that openly with you on the discussion page of Bosendorfer not a on page that no one bothers reading except you and your accomplice Andrew Norman

You should be ashamed of your dishonest behaviour of having contacted Andrew Norman and Andrew Norman should also be ashamed of having used his administrators power deceptively to help you out I could say

Is this Wikipedia What a shame

It is the first time I use this xxx Wikipedia and the last

You will get my feedback only on the Bosendorfer discussion page when Andrew Norman your accomplice will have unblocked me Shame on you
