This is not vandalism If you look at the quoted text from the notice You may remove this message if you improve the article or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason To avoid confusion it helps to explain why you object to the deletion either in the edit summary or on the talk page If this template is removed it should not be replaced it states that I may remove the notice Furthermore I did explain on more than one occasion that I was removing the message because Mais Ouis had failed to provide any explanation as to why it should be deleted and invited them to do so They didnt It also states clearly that if the template is removed it should not be replaced and it was So fuck off
