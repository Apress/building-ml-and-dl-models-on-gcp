impact page 

you might as well just give up dude  i can and will continue to make this update if i have to visit the page every 5 minutes i have the time
i remember you from the discussion about the whitecaps and not wanting them to have a new page for their MLS entity  you dont know jack about MLS and therefore you do not get the last say about how an MLS page is updated  these games are officially broadcast by the league itself and the numbers are being worn and are clearly visible and assigned to players that official league announcer are referring to   so obviously they are going by some sort of officially published rosters  the impact website is NOT the only way to have valid information  if and when the website is updated and any numbers differ they can be changed at that time  your insisting that my own fking eyes are not a good enough validation nor is the OFFICIAL league broadcasters is completely idiotic and pedantic  there is no problem erring on the side of more information being available on wikipedia especially since it was information that was out there to be gathered and put on wikipedia in the first place  it isnt like the information is made up  it comes from a reliable source  the league itself  it just so happens i was the only one dedicated enough to watch the game and compile the numbers and you were too lazy to do so
