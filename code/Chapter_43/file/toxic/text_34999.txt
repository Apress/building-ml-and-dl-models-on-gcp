you suck 
You suck Jpgordon even if you adminscheckusers find our IPs and block them for long periods of time all we have to do is press the reset button on our modems and within 5 minutes we would get a new IP and be able to vandalize again As a result I hope you admins realize that blocking is useless That is indeed what I always do when I get blocked And to save you the time of yet another checkuser the IP I am using now is 1749192166 and in case you havent figured it out I previously used the IP 174919728 see httpsenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleSpecialLogblockpageUser3A174919728 which was blocked for 3 months yesterday useless block its quite easy to circumvent it
