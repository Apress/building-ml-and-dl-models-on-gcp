Ok Mr Sarky  since YOU didnt check your facts

Brixton is in Lambeth And so is Kennington And so is Stockwell although thats irrelevant as Roger Moore was actually born in Vauxhall also in Lambeth Incidentally as you know because presumably you bothered to read my original entry properly I didnt claim John Major was born in Lambeth  I said he grew up there

Idiot
