Little quick on the trigger aintcha bud 

You know if youre not even going to give somebody 30 seconds to go in and add the appropriate citations or references the argument COULD be made that youre just an insecure anal orifice who doesnt want anybody else adding to what he perceives as his page  that TOTALLY flies in the very face of what Wikipedia is supposed to be about  I WAS going to add the appropriate references including a link to a WAV of the song but since I dont feel like wasting my time only to have your ego play Goebbels again why bother  By the way Im not sure how you arrive at your conclusion that its somehow libelous to point out that a celebrity who by the way has been deceased for 35 years actually had a sense of humor about his own foibles but its asinine  First of all you cant libel a deceased person second even if you could a compliment which is what it was is not libelous and third 
Aw hell  Third youre a moron
Nuff said
