Comments on TalkAshurism 

Hi Elias  You made a few comments on the above talk page such as Damn Garzo no offence and I do mean this in a positive way but youre truly a pain in the ass  You are obviously like most Wikipedians an enemy of Freedom of Speech you have issues with someone questioning your motives and you are also a hypocrite and Thats really because you are an old man Garzo You know a little stiff Again no offence but you should stop taking yourself too seriously you know be a little bit more humble   While none of these are taken in context especially offensive your tone was flippant and unhelpful and bordering on rude in the second example with some unfair accusations of racism also made  

I dont want to have to block you again as youre clearly a bright and valuable contributor for the most part but please try and bear in mind the feelings of others  not everyone may share your sense of humour on what is ostensibly a scholarly project and calling your fellow editors pain in the ass racist hypocrite or old man is rude no matter how many times you say no offence or add smileys to the end of the sentence  Please be more civil in the future If you have any questions let me know
