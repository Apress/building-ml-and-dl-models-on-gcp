UFC 82

Seriously  Tuckdogg Faggot   stop being an uptight bitch its ok for koschecks announced matchup to be on the ufc 82 page first of all it isnt a rumor you  faggot he confirmed it and when Chuck liddell confirmed the UFC 79 fight it was left TBD and second of all the ufc doesn have to announce it the fighter does

If Koscheck ever does end up fighting at ufc 82 im gomnna kick the shit out of you and make you suck my cock which is probably gonna happen since HE ANNOUNCED IT FAG
