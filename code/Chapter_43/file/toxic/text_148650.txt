Look you moron if the 1000 series is T1000 Then guess whats the 800 series is MORON IDIOT And as stated here in one of the discussion in this page
I agree with Christopher Thomas below regarding unclarified sources for this article  Specifically I take issue with the entire Differences between the 800 and 850 series section because I contend that there is no such thing as a T850  Stan Winston Studios which designed the terminators for the films confirmed this to me via email when I wrote to them asking their opinion  Their response direct quote Im not sure where the T850 came from  As far as I know Arnolds Terminator has and always will be the T800 model 101  Now the robot Terminators in T3 are T1s and Kristana Loken is the TX  I hope that clears it up  While the term T850 is somewhat widespread on the internet even extending to T3related merchandise such as action figures its origin is to my mind something of a mystery  Rich 
 Stan Winston DESIGNED the Terminator and he says its T800 Now shut the fuck up and change it back you idiot
