Dave1185 is just an insulting rude editor Look at the top of his homepage 
Vandals trolls and other fiendly visitors please note Wikipedia is a community not a crazy den of pigs
Social experimenters please note Were an encyclopedia not a bunch of lab rats in a cage
I personally try to respect anyone and not to prejudice like Dave1185 That does not mean that i am always forgiving But even just using the ugly rudeness of himself against him several times did not stop him A famous scientist i currently dont remember which quoted You cant overestimate the dumbness of manhood
