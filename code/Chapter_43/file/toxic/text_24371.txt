This article is ludicrous it paints antireligonists with some kind of generalizing brush that Atheists have been getting away with for decades now That is that we can refer to ourselves in the 3rd person and apply any positive adjective we wish Ie OHare and other Atheists claiming Atheists would rather do X than Y But when the same generalized tone is applied in a perjorative sense they scream bloody murder at whoever dares to stereotype them

The Murder of Atheists is a beautiful thing OHares bones are lying deep down as are her fucking childrens
