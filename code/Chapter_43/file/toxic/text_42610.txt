Dont be stupid You know Im twice as irritated with you as you are with Sheryn If you dont like her SHUT UP and LEAVE Wikipedia is no place for mongrels like you I do not care if you live in Chicago the UK or some place but being totally foolish in Wikipedia is uncalled for We dont need to know that you find Sheryns voice sounding like Tuesday Vargas Unless you find a news article saying so then go ahead
I may agree with you regarding incorporating titles here in Wikipedia articles but just so you know this is Star Records idea and not her fans Dont sound as if you know EVERYTHING about Sheryn In fact you dont have any right to edit her article if you dont know her Just because you see her on TV doesnt mean you know her In the future we will develop a more unbiased version of this article do not worry As long as QUIT MESSING AROUND WITH THIS VERSION I am tired of watching behind you and cleaning your crap Be educated while in Wikipedias premises
