Your hypocrisy amuses me 

Look at your userpage It has webhost written all over it If i had to lose mine which i might add was of religious value to me then you must certainly have to remove yours Take a look at User Guinnog for example This also has webhost written all over it I put it to you you elitist authoritarian administrator that your userpage is not in line with the goals of wikipedia

What do i have to do to become an admin Im told Id be a great addition to the team
