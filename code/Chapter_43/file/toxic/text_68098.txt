From the superdouble covert files of the Wikipolice type guy 

Youre a goshdarned whackjob I just looked at your edit war with some obvious joker over the Rock Lobsterfamily guy thing and it made my mind up about whether or not to donate to Wikipedia I love the wikipedia concept but when youre an example of the typical user Im sad to say that I just cant believe in it That you resorted to every conceivable argument to keep a wellattested fact out of a popculture page is just pathetic Do you care so much about the song that the mere mention of its use in a stupid show like Family Guy requires you to spend hours and hours trying to keep that information off the wikipedia page

I hope your fingers all fall off so you have to find something better to do than edit wiki pages
