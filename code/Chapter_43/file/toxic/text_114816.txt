Hey Malik Shabazz hows it feel to know I played you like a fool This dumb racist wannabeJew moron actually thought he was having an intellectual discussion with ElliotJoyce when ElliotJoyce was none other than Vost the same user that had ripped Malik Shabazz a new asshole months earlier But you know what the funniest part of all this is I WIN I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with Vost ElliotJoyce or Accreditor and Ive used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudointellectual cancers like you sweety See from all of the edits I do you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert while Ive been keeping you busy with Vost socks which itself is a sock of another account Ive committed over 200 edits under the radar from specialproxy rotations in the last 4 days I have 2 admin accounts 5 nonadmin accounts of previously active users which Ive since been able to commandeer more on this later and about 10 standard selfcreated accounts Whats even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I dont even have to do anything to get my views to dominate I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is I got you yes you you Jewwannabe black racist cancer smear to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me vendetta style I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS And even after all that my major points and edits prevailed I win and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own my victory is that much more devastating The IP Im using at the moment courtesy of the 24hour computer lab in my dorm is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy and thus blocked Oh and regarding the commandeering of accounts graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction GAPBAD is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash  Youve been warned in advance Just remember I win You cant do anything to me Go back to being a Jewwannabe sweety Jews are white not black Remember that too thats why youre not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish OWNED Hows that taste L M F A O
