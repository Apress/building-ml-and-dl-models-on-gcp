You are talking nonsense again The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work well most of them anyway and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence or rather the complete lack of it and modern research which is unanimously against the theory Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma and he has never been refuted Chrys C Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source Development of Greek and the New Testament Mohr Siebeck ISBN 3161482905 is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the protoSemitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone
