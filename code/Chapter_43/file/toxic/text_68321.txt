STOP DELETING MY ADDITION  You MuboshguMephistophelian say

Please do not use talk pages  for general discussion of the topic They are
for discussion related to improving the article They are not to be used as a
forum or chat If you continue to use talk pages as you do you may be blocked
from editing You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner Please stop

I AM NOT generally discussing a topic I AM NOT chatting I AM NOT
pushing a POV  If you do not understand basic English grammar you have
no business telling me anything  FACT commas are used in this context to
separate a list a series of related clauses  Grammar is not a matter of a
general discussion or chatting or a point of view  It is a technically
precise set of rules and in this case a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud  THIS IS NOT OPINION IT IS FACT IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE

FROM TALK GUIDELINES why dont you review them

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation suggestion and personal
knowledge on talk pages with a view to prompting further investigation

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you Being
friendly is a great help

 It is always a good idea to explain your views it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to park material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns while references are sought or concerns
discussed

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish

 Do not threaten people For example 
having them banned for disagreeing with you

 removing others comments is sometimes allowed
But you should  stop if there is any objection

As I previously posted here THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no natural born citizen requirement that is applicable today
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article not
a matter of opinion and a matter of grammatical fact

If I say No animal except a mouse or a rat at the time I give the signal
shall be captured then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL  My order has no validity at any other point in
time  Similarly the requirement for natural born citizen only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION  It does not apply today and
the following clause should be part of the article since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article

No person except a natural born Citizen or a
Citizen of the United States at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution shall be eligible
to the Office of President neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States
