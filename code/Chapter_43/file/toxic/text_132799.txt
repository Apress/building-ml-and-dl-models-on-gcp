Tell you what  Just forget it  Forget I ever existed  I really cant be bothered with this bullshit  Somebody comes tramping in starts hackandslash editing a sensitive article wielding his mighty POV as the only possible truth labels everyone who disagrees as trolls and somehow this is OK  He boasts of his massive donations to Wikipedia  well if hes donated good on him but that shouldnt mean he should be able to make edits willynilly  Look at his fucking edit history for christs sake  The people hes not trying to get banned hes trying to drive away  Just rename it Merkeypedia and be done with it

I have a bunch of stuff I was going to post thats utterly nonrelated to Cherokees or anything Mr Merkey would even consider interesting  If I get round to it maybe Ill bother to log in as an anon once my IP has changed and upload it  If not well I wont  No great loss WP has lived without my edits until now ad will continue to live without them tomorrow

pissed off rant
