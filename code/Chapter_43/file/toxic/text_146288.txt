The homepage of the Anarchist Internatonal wwwanarchyno  is not nonsensensial Try to prove it and you will fail The article Anarchist International on Wikipedia is objective and to the point 

The organizationsnetworks associated to the Anarchist International are found at the linkpage of wwwanarchyno  and then there is a big network of networkmemberssubscribers related to the different organizationsnetworks

As for Zazaban I have problems with taking him seriously In a discussion on Anarchismnet he answered with the following intelligent and a bit ochlarchical statements
