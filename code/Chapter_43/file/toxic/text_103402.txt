To Richard Wang 

Man you got issues My wife tried to be nice to you but  no I know what you said about Dennis mom at school and I think your a sick little punk Use language like that and I swear Ill fly over to Australia and wash out that dirty mouth of yours with soap Im tired of tedious old lectures now cease this dirty talk or Ill fly over to Australia and make you learn your lesson How dare you call my wife a bully on her talk page You will talk to Dennis Annihi later and Cenabee tomorrow and apologise
