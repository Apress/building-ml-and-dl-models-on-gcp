Humans SUCK 
I am ashamed of what we humans have done to planet Earth  The corporations and business interests have put their myopic vision of more and more profits for themselves and their shareholders above everything else  Forests clearcut killing a 1000 year old tree without even a second of remorse and look at how we dont give a shit about the GIANT plastic waste problem Nobody could give a rats assits out there in the Pacific so its out of sight and out of mindwith the exception of token articles or entries such as this one  We humans have poisoned maimed raped clear cutted trawledand basically assfucked the planet into oblivion  The once glorious oceans have been decimated by relentless TAKING and never EVER GIVING BACK  

We humans are ugly greedy creatures  We have poisoned our own home and killed off many other species  Are ALL are part of this disgusting shitty race called humans  Heres hoping we dont spread our greed pollution and misery to other planets  Maybe this ongoing selfdestruction we are moving ahead with apace is natures way of eventually eliminating our species from the planet
