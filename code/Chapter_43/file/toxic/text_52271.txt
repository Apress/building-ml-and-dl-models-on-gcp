ReMere Rubbish 
I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish According to the southeast asian history most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus some rulers came from Persia map covered Middle east Greece west India  Achaemenid Empire Seleucid Empire Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty please look at the size of the map their conquered Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom

In the old days it was slavery society no sultanate and no democracy yet all Hindu rulers belong to higher class common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia they called themselves high class peoples the rest are merely slaves Parameswara is a Hindu ruler he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism

As for the Macedonian bloodline this is also not completely rubbish In the old days the Persian empire was so big they are so proud with king Alexander the Great Also they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor Pasai etc Parameswara later married Pasais princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great I dont think all this is completely rubbish

Anyway please correct me I may be wrong too
