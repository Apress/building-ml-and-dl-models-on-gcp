did it ever occur to you that somebody simply had to just click undo in order to get the same edit result

has it crossed your mind that quite possibly there could be more than one person in this world that would think of doing that

so what about all the edits today taht are similar 

was i responsible for those too despite the different IPs

hereill save you the timeNOi wasnt

im shocked you havent blamed me for those too

there really is no talking logic with some of you idiots is there

you get these delusional ideasand thats itthats the way it has to be because thats the idea you had during a dungeons and dragons game

ill say this one more time for youYOU ARE DEAD FUCKING WRONG AND ARE MAKING YOURSELF LOOK LIKE AN ASSHOLE BY JUMPING TO YOUR STUPID CONCLUSIONS
