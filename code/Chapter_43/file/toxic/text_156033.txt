Note to random idiot pedophile I already called for an actual Wikipedian to feel free to wikify the entry I put in However for your boychat ass to remove the link to the Wiki which isnt being used as a source but instead links to it where it is referenced in the article but then claim that Boychat a message board forum is a source that meets Wikipedia standards is hilariously silly Also the OR claim regarding the three counts is again ridiculous The Detroit News article says he had X number of child pornography pictures and X number of child pornography videos The Detroit News publication meets proper sourcing on Wikipedia 

Your cooperation random IP is very much appreciated
