Pembroke suckscom 
I am from the pembroke area and I found the link to pembroke sucks usefull and interesting It is as far as I know the only forum dedicated to pembroke and the pembroke area I say as far as policy is concerned coming on here everyday to remove a link that walks the line between usefull and not usefull is imho a little excesive I understand that the people who run pembroke sucks also dont seem to know when enough is enough I myself have removed large adds for their site from the pembroke article and they should get the hint like you dont own this site and technically your link shouldnt be here So why do you think it is somehow your right to post itbut really its a link its not even in the main body of the article This is not a gateway to some larger problem Let it go stop being a link nazi and stop posting your link where its not welcome This is not one of the articles where links are used to support points of view like on i dont know white power sites so whats the big deal
