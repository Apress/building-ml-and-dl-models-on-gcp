I KEEP asking the question and it NEVER gets answered WHY are there multiple Wiki censors 247 doing their damnest to censor every word within seconds while contributing zero while in the full and undeniable knowledge that Kleargear is a scam on the public

To have fully referenced material continually removed on the basis of some biblical gobblygook nonesense spouted by those concerned soley about the next badge means this forum is 100 and fully useless in protecting the public from a very obvious fraud policies and procedures are wonderful concepts when one is discussing a legitimate business  WTF good are they if they protect and promote a complete and horrid fraud

MULTIPLE Censors deleting everything and contributing nothing while driving away contributors and this example could not possibly be any more sickening Wiki has become a boyo playpen  not a serious forum that serves a purpose for the good of the public
