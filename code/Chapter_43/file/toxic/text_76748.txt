Wikipedia is a bias organization I provided sources as to why I made those changes yet they were denied because they were unreliable according to Wikipedia guidelines which is false The guidelines are a joke in the first place I also made my proposal but before I could even finish making my proposal Decausa jumped in right away and tried attacking my viewpoints even though I gave sources and facts How come you didnt suspend him for that huh I took a long time writing that proposal and he didnt even let anybody look at it before he jumped in and thats why I got angry He is supposed to be a moderator and he is being so biased Out of all the sources on the Kurdish language he decided to find 3 that disagreed with me just so he can get on my nerves Where is the justice for him It is so easy to to just suspend accounts but your not creating a solution to the problem Even as we are speaking right now there is a proposal on the Kurds Talk page that is in favor of removing the term Iranian for Kurds with more people supporting it than opposing but I see no fucking changes
