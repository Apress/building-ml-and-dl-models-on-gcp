I have my life unlike you because Im not ugly uneducated and poor like you Saying battle for Persian Gate is much more a decisive victory for Macedonians than Thermopylae was for Persians is your proGreek completely nonsense Persians won the battle of Thermopylae easily and Alexander was almost defeated at Persian Gates  first Macedonian attack was repelled and second one caused heavy casualties on Macedonian side I know your mommy told you stories about brave unbeatable Alexander before you gone to bed but this article is not about Greek fairy tales but about history Thank you 93142189185
