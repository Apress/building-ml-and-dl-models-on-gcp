More rubbish This page contains 0000001 of the actual amount of news coverage theres been of the Olympics so that claim is clearly nonsense There are no differing interpretations here at all theres people talking about policies that they know about and then theres you who can barely even match up a policy to the issue it governs  NOTABILITY doesnt control content in articles RECENT doesnt bar the inclusion of recent incidents NOTNEWS doesnt forbid the use of journalistic sources WPILIKEIT only applies to deletion debates etc etc etc You can claim all you want that incidents werent controversial but merely pointing out that the word controversial isnt in the source is about the thinnest argument you could ever produce to support it and in the case of Kim Collins its actually a lie there are soucres calling it controversial I dont think you even bother looking half the time
