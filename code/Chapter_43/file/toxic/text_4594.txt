I refer to peoples constantly taking the words of Jimbo as policy the idea of removing any userbox with a political point of view is his point of view  Thats at the core of this problem you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox  Rather there is Jimbo saying there shouldnt be any  I completely understand that he started this but he is not owner of it a foundation was set up perhaps youve heard of it  the Wikimedia Foundation  I didnt say you had that same point of view Im saying that I was just telling the people who do to fuck off  I made no attack on any editor that you perceive it as such is truly sad but such is life  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language  If one does not want personal pages on a site one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that theyre being used  People who overstep the proper bound of their position should die that I have encountered multiple administrators so far doing so does lead to the desire to fuck off but Im not done here
