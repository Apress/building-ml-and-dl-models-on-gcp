Some reading material 

I was listening to The Ballad of JamesBWatson and was inspired to make some poetry

You are bizarre and a knob
Youre a terrible bum and a snob
Youre a simian loser
A malodorous boozer
And a boob and a fiend and a slob

You are insane and a brat
Youre a miscreant mule and a prat
Youre a rube and a dog
An unscrupulous hog
And your mind is redundant and fat

You are a putz and a mule
Youre a fool and a goob and a tool
Youre a brat and a goob
A bum and a rube
Youre creepy disgusting and cruel

You are a twit and a drunk
Youre a snot and an obstinate punk
Youre a spaz and a sham
An androgynous ham
And a pain and a schmuck and a skunk
