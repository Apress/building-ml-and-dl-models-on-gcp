Admin abuse on Wikipedia is a serious problem 

I looked up Wikipedias rules regarding that and I followed YOUR PROTOCOL regarding admins abusing power IT STATES THAT I HAVE TO NOTIFY AN ADMIN IF I AM GOING TO REPORT HIM

I DID THAT

go look up your own rules please 

My god what a bullying bunch of powerhungry maniacs you have all turned into

You guys need a very large mirror  Have you been abused soo much in your life that you cant look at yourselves anymore  

I am really sorry for you all
