You display your ignorance The dim bulb in question was paranoid and he was stupid the classic definitions without a shade of exaggeration An accurate description isnt an insult censor Why you people feel the need to interfere when you dont understand is beyond me

When cletus wrote his stupid paranoid schlock viz 

I do not support the interjection of However this accomplishment was short live That does not make sense That sentence takes away from his great accomplishment It infers that he did something wrong or something happened and he did not act It has a negative connotation What is the point of that sentence

There should be an entire section devoted to his accomplishment of paying off the national debt

Subtle propaganda

The diction does not make sense and should be changed or removed

That is paranoid and stupid In fact if youre censoring me surely that garbage should also have been censored on the grounds that it is incoherent babble or whatever euphemism you censors use
