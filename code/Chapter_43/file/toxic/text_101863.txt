resignation 

After months of contributing to this site I have finally had enough of its petty pathetic idiotic rules and guidelines Firstly on the article the fog you try adding just a few things and some complete wanker goes and starts undoing it all just because its  not what they think is right Then you get told about a load of rules and guidelines for pitty sake Why are there rules and guidelines on a free editing site But worst of all why do some of the stupid editors think they are in government They think they are all great and powerful but really theyre weak and pathetic 

After all that I had been defeated by a few idiots so I left it if they want to be that stupid let them I had been editing George of the jungle 2 for some time but all my work had been undone I can only think the editor went through my contributions to see what I had been doing I tried coming to a solution with them but again it was ignored So because they were determined to have their way I had to let them This is the sort of thing that goes on a lot and I have had enough I wont try and contribute as it either goes against what someone thinks is right or goes against some poxy rule Well what a shit site Also saying my English is poor well George of the jungle 2 starts a sentence with anyway for crying out loud Im done bye thanks for nothing
