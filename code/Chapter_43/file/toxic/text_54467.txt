MY POST ISNT ORIGINAL RESEARCH  ITS SIMPLE FACT  What is so difficult for you to understand  its FACT thats the way lagalese works  position statements are part of legalese  Youre saying youd skip over the statement water is wet as original research  Quite frankly your assertion that it is original research is LUDACRIS  I dont know whether or not your intentionally mischaracterizing things or whether youre truely this ignorant
 There is a HUGE point in having this discussion  its a refutation of avrahams assertion that the 1975 policy statement is irrelevant  but its apparently a refutation that you dont have the knowledge of legalese to understand  which isnt my fault  Im not going to explain to you a third time the legalese equivalent of water is wet
 The simple FACT is youre wrong  its not my problem that you dont have a good enough education to understand why despite my explaining it to you
