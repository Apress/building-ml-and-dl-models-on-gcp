I am PISSED OFF 
Okay I used to be a troll and a vandal  I used to be large amounts of my time insulting and upsetting users and ruining articles for my own amusement Recently I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent respectful contributor I created an article called Adult Diapers in France In this article I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country

Within minutes  UserEscape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was advertising and my page was unambiguously promotional This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article

Secondly UserPurplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first then create my article However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker

In conclusion I am getting fed up of wikipedia I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again Good day
