MY CHANGES DO NOT AFFECT ANY OF THE CONCOCTED OFFENSES YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP

I want to bring your OWN STANCE as being pro orthodox which in itself is BIASED

i am again going to put the changes back on BECAUSE I believe your STANCE IS TO PROTECT THE CURRENT SINGH SABHA ideological stance on sikhism WHICH MEANS that wikipedia ONLY ACCEPTS ORTHODOX POV and NOT unorthodox Which means going by your OWN judgment that the CHRISTIAN UNORTHODOX CHURCH which exist on real life and on wiki HAS NO merit

THAT IS A BIASED APPROACH
