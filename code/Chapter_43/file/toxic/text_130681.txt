Congratulations 

Well I suppose I have to confess I was wrong Your pointless pedantic and punitive block did more than just piss me off after all It meant there were several vandal edits to pages on my watchlist that I couldnt revert including some that stuck around for several hours so you managed to piss me off and damage the project too Please accept my hearty congratulations

You made a block made without regard for timing circumstance or anything except a blind jobsworthlike adherence to the letter of the rules

The sarcastic applause you can hear in the background is coming from the evergrowing number of people who think WP administrators are largely a joke and whom you have just helped prove correct Its admins like you that give the whole WP admin team a bad name Â TCE
