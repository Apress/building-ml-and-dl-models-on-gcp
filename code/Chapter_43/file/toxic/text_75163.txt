FLAT OUT  If you say what are his powers  A bunch of info on actual physics does not apply  It is valid information and interesting information but by the strictest definition of WHAT CAN THE CHARACTER DOWHAT HAS THE CHARACTER SHOWN TO BE ABLE TO DO actual facts about real world research is NOT a factor  I say AGAIN IF YOU SAY WHAT ARE THE HULKS POWERS they are what they were written to be  Also if some of you are unawareTHE HULK IS NOT REAL  HE IS SCIENCE FANTASY  That means that you suspend your belief temporarily and accept that someone can grow 2 feet and bench press a precinct  Real world explainations of SCIENCE FANTASY maybe an interesting tidbit but is UNIQUELY NOT HIS POWERS
