John Stranges own nutjob words But in view of the lower limit for the existence of CaphtorKeftiu I would hesitate to identify in with Crete if there is nothing which definitely warrants such an identification Too bad for him that Cretan citynames following kftiw are  carved in stone during Amenhotep III Theres nothing to debate because Keftiu is Crete with _100_ certainty John Strange is an idiot
