What page No page was put up as an article  Per the Wiki guidelines nothing was put up as an article  A page was being utilized as a user page simply to figure out the structure of Wikipedia to learn the coding of  Wikipedia and to experiment with  Some text was simply cut and pasted onto a page per Wiki guidelines nothign was submitted as an article because the test area was to be kept to a user area  This is what we were doing  Using the user name as a testing area PER WIKI GUIDLINES  No article would have been submitted until such time as it met Wiki guidelines but you you deleted the page before that could take place  Are you really this obtuse  In all seriousness testing are refining articles in user pages is encouraged by Wikipedia  This is what we were doing  In our opinion you are not familiar enough with Wiki guidelines to exercise any control over the deletion of articles  It is the afternoon  Elementary school should be getting out soon  There should be some 9 year old that you can go outside and shove around  I regret that you have little authority over your real life but I dont think the intent of Wiki was for you to vent that frustration and lack of control in meatspace over the entirety of the Encyclopedia  Thanks for deleting the demo template you complete and utter fuckwit  Next time well just throw something into the public domain and give you something to actually do other than mentally masturbate
