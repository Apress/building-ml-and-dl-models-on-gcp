Seating Capacity 
Some foolish people told me to discuss here first No problem Ok I am extremely sure that there are two typical types of 3class seating of A340200 which are 239 and 261 According to the main page of Airbus the seating capacity is shown as 240 which is rounded up from 239 Also I cited a lot of relevant and reliable sources Please foolish people if you know nothing about this topic please do not revert edits which are actually thr truth Or else you should really feel ashamed of yoursevlves
