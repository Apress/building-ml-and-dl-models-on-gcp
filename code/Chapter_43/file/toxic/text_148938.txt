Bone to pick friendsChris Evans 

Alright Ive waited my week long block to type this Whats the big deal That other IP you blocked brought up a good point Jon Favreau lists friends namely Vince Vaughn Leonardo Dicaprio does Kate Winslet too But my question is that why is it fine to have it on their articles but here its a huge problem And theres always a million excuses trivia OR lousy content All Im doing is going off what the other articles on this site did and added it as Hell it should be considered passable due to the amount of films they did together At least note that on the article But no whenever I add it the response I get is the equivalent of being told to go fuck myself Im only trying to help out Just because Im an IP doesnt give you the right to push me around and treat e like shot
