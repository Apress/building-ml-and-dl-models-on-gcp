I have to put this as sittign here cackling my head off  Are you peopel on leave from a psyche hospital  I just found the following post from prissy Dame Ewart on some other users talk page

Its all very weird  This Gretaw is not me  It seems she also is offended by Dame Sara so good on her  Fancy this Sarah going to anothers talk page and speakign to them as though they are someone else  That is so wacko  Shows how you guys are  Very delusional

Its a delicious honour to be blocked from you feral ninnys  TY for the compliment  I just edit on Helpcom but really what a waste of time editing anywhere especially when no one pays for the effort

Ensure Dame Sarah reads this below the obvious delusional it is  No one presumes to that extent unless the need some help

Why would I register an accoutn when I wont even sign posts too much IT nous for that whereas the rest of u dont it seems

edit Gundagai
Ms Gundagai normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention so far all your edits except those to your userpage have been devoted to me but article talk pages are for discussing the article not for making personal attacks on other users If you wish to give me feedback I would be most interested to read it The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage not article or project space
If you truly object to editors fiddlingand inteferring with some elses words then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you Every time you make an edit you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people At the bottom of each edit page is this statement If you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others do not submit it
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users The community condemns personal attacks and should you choose to continue making them it will result in further and longer range blocks Its very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors Im sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf So thankyou for that I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia Sarah Ewart Talk
