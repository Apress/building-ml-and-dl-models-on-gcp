And now for some amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment finally I Butros The Mighty have defeated you Crum375 Space Commander From Swalwell 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day And now that my long struggle is over how about a little amusement
With a clap of my jewelbedecked hands I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my PanGalactic SlaveHarem 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel Star Of Abuse III and melted it into slag from which the galaxys greatest artisans have forged a grand towering statue of me A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled pinning me under its plinth the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace covered in a gigantic spacetarp but not so fast Crum we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geostationary orbit above my palace At the merest touch of a button I can activate the AstroDetonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen Princess Angela may be my own daughter but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wikilovers into spacedust Even now helplessly strapped into titanium spacemanacles they witness all I say and do on the ProjectoScreen of the Gallant Hello my fair daughter How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own DOOM
Ha ha ha ha ha
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends your booblover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet Even now I can see they long for me to discharge the FangCreatures of Carnivoron into their glasswalled prison thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory But no First they will watch you writhe in defeat
And that is not all Crum Surely even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate you can see that to my right I have held at BlastoRaypoint by my RoboLegionnaires bound and displayed for all to see Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad Repturova the Talurnian walkinglizard spy who betrayed me by joining you Weissus commander of the Valkyrie WarJet Platoon And last but not least your beloved Julian Van August
And now with the merest wave of my HypnoScepter Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell DANCE Dance for my amusement Let the sight of your seductively writhing body contorting itself for my viewing pleasure be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames 
Tears Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375 also kown as Linda Mack Ohho Even I in my most sinister depraved dreams would never have imagined it
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT NEHHEH hehhehhehheh HA HAHAHAHA
How glorious At last with trumpet fanfare from my AstroOrchestra I order the curtain raised from my statue andWHAT  Its a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV And who is that emerging from the gangplank Crum herelf 
NO 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my RoboLegionnaires into nothing with TransmutOBracelets concealed in their manacles Weissus swings his mighty SpaceMace smashing the controls to my torturous devices My HypnoScepter forced from my grasp by Prince Kazaks MagnetoShootoBeam Julian Van August running free into the awaiting arms of CRUM
Then who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate What Emitting the telltale sparks and earsmoke of an android double Drat Its nothing more than a simple robomannequin decoy 
Aiyeee The Spaceship Gallant with Princess Angela at the helm is divebombing the Great Celestial Palace Billowing clouds of spacesmoke Crowds running everywhere Kaff Im choking Kaff kaff Victory haskaffslipped through my fingerskaff kaffonce again Kaff kaffCURSE YOU CRUM kaff 375 Kaff CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER Kaff kaff kaff kaff

THE END
