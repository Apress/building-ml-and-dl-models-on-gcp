Getting REALLY annoyed
OK the list here is barely usable  It sucks  I dont think we should change it because the Arcs and other useful information supposedly dont fit here BUT WHY CANT I PUT A SIMPLE LINK TO A WEBSITE THAT DOES HAVE THAT INFORMATION  That website has all kinds of valuable information that is DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ARTICLE  Yet some WikiNazi thinks that this is his personal article and keeps making up some BS about how my link is a form of advertisement or some shit  There are NO ADS  It is another wiki site and it is 100 ON TOPIC WITH USEFUL INFORMATION THAT EVERYONE KEEPS TRYING TO ADD TO THIS ARTICLE  Since he wont let his PERSONAL wiki site be altered with USEFUL INFORMATION then let me keep the link  Im so sick of pedantic fools making wikipedia so useless and difficult to use  I get that this page should reflect wikistandards but that link I added is 100 relevant and is far more justified than plenty of external links Ive seen on other pages
