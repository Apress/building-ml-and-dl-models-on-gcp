Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement excepting its two postscripts before I was blocked I suspect that User AuburnPilot had me blocked in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct Although I was directed to request an unblock of User Physicq210 who had blocked me requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself and write as though User Physicq210 had acted in good faith and was one of the good guys That would be surreal and would give User Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions And so the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User Physicq210 but since Im not a devious sort I have nothing against the latter reading this Indeed I want User Physicq210 to read it For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting than to go down the long dark road of selfabnegation and selfcensorship including the use of bad English After all if I wanted to be a lackey I could go to graduate school

User AuburnPilot

A few days ago User AuburnPilot began stalking me checking wherever I had made edits and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship User AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes Zero tolerance

He claims of any source he politically dislikes that it is either spam or a blog or POV another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV even though the one source is a previously published classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web httpgeocitiescomnstixwaronpolicehtml which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site and the other source is the longest most thorough expos√© yet published on the Duke rape hoax httpvdarecomstix070113_dukehtm

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles since I hadnt done any writing on the articles in question Crystal Gail Mangum Michael Nifong 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling
Ive been involved in edit wars before though I have never been the aggressor and have never initiated an elective edit war though given the selfassurance that aggressors such as User AuburnPilot exude perhaps I ought to reconsider that position It seems that aggressors rule here

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante threatening to have me banned
httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleUser_talk7023199239redirectno if I do not surrender to his censorship Should you find for me please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a ceaseanddesist order Should you however find for the censor please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors

PS January 19 2007 115A EST Since beginning this complaint I see that User AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony User Physicq210 to block me thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me but preventing me from responding to his thuggery And no I am not going to use cutesy euphemistic language If I were into such deception I would have become a liar er lawyer and would be worthless as an encyclopedist And I was unable to email User Physicq210 because I am not logged in and You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated email address in your preferences to send email to other users httpenwikipediaorgwikiSpecialEmailuserPhysicq210

If this isnt cyberStalinism I dont know what is So let me get this straight Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces User AuburnPilots penchant for saying Thank you after vandalizing ones links is civil but complaining about such abuse counts as spam disruption incivility and personal attacks If that is verily so then 2  2  5

PPS The message here says that I was temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits What the heck is that supposed to mean For restoring footnotes and links that User AuburnPilot had vandalized If that constitutes disruptive edits then youve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency Sorry but I dont have any sympathy for the Devil
