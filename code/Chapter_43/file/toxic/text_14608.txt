Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network He will not provide proof of his comic roofis as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie Both of his books pamplets are home published and could be considered very racist This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page

No RESULTS
On June 12th 2008 GLOBETREKER says
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together Not in the usual format as a printed affair He uses the term loosely since its not a real printed comic He has no examples of his drawing what kind of cartoonist doesnt put their work online PROVE THAT SHIT

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverendings 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing one thousand copies and third printing two thousand copies of Battle Neverending I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year 

Example 1 of his lies

2000 copies of AD supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states Record Time which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings
The first AD was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing pamphlets sold out and was not reprinted

However his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University AD which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997

When in reality

Lofton wrote AD while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid

Example 2 of his lies

I m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY you always want to appear very radical so Im sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley because you made that up as well as being homeless The only place youve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE

Example 3 of his lies

In all the WEEKS youve been STALKING me NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as emailed me and asked is this anonymous psuedonymusing piece of shit correct about anything

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldnt expect any response I write these things simply because I know that you cant handle risking your supposed fame Which is all you are interested in anyway Your not an activist youre an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass

Heres the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly its chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that hes just another home publishing hack

Ive looked into the books listed in the bibliography The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing pamphlets sold out and was not reprinted The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as obviously a lowbudget and quitepossibly homeprinted affair There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review much less meet WPBOOK Journalists are a dimeadozen and not automatically notable and these books dont appear to establish notability either

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article If the tag is remove would someone please nominate for deletion I cant as I cant create the deletion page 6767219223 talk 

Ill keep an eye on it I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was too radical  Steve Dufour talk 
I went looking for sources didnt find any agreed with proposed deletion phoebe  talk to me 

YOU HAVE NO NOTABILITY BECAUSE YOU MAKE YOUR SHIT UP
