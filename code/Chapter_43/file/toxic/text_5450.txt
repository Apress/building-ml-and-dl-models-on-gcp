Thought it might as well stand there too since nothing but cencorship can be expected by some sheep on wikipedia only just recently realizing that his whole life his wife and kids is just there to serve a master and therefore fanatically defending his beliefs to the contrary despite overwhelming evidence You can go back you your boring life now Ian I dont expect this no evidence from experts thread to stand for long anyway sheep And this was supposed to be an objective lexcon Learn something new everyday I guess or as in your case rather not because it would mean you life ment nothingD Keep living in denial Ian and dont forget to cencor I maen where would we be without cencorship free and informed ppl Cant have that
