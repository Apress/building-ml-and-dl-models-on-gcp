Dude
what is your problemAre you nuts
There are many articles in wiki that doesnt match wiki criteriaAnd you find it mine only

If I create and edit my own articleabout my own place then what the fuck is your problem
You show fucking barn stars in wiki I dont know how it seems
Without looking to the talk page of Sector 06 Rourkela you made the article for speedy deletion

I guess you dont have any other work You could have pasted a notification prior to deletion
It seems you will not let me work in my article
