 Spanish heraldry 

As a respected contributor to the above article youre probably best placed to deal with the issues with it If you want to take it on I believe there is a lack of inline citations in particular good English and specificity  parts of the article explain heraldry in general and are not sufficiently IMHO to be included in the article eg most of the Definitions section Thanks   t c 

 BCNSIA discussion 

First sorry because my poor english

Hi i dont want to start a undowar or something like that but the avionews post is only a rumour Its a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer

Ive talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue nor the SIABCN cancellation nor the FCOMXP flights traspassing and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters

Unfortunately I havent found any italyUK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

Because of that I have twicked the comment from until summer 2009 to probably until summer 2009 in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners
In the article the text refered Today the SiA flights carry out the SingaporeMalpensaBarcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to SingaporeMalpensa route while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia is not referenced as Bonomis words but as an explanation by Avionews
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets Sincerely I fail to see your urge to remove it Cheers MauritiusXXVII Aut Disce Aut Doce Aut Discede 

I dont have a urge to remove it I dont remove it I only explain it to you the situation  Preceding unsigned comment added by 85583497
