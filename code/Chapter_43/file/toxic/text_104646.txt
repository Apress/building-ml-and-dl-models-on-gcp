never 

I deleted all you message without reading you are a sick and a cruel person I would not like to see you ever again at my talk page  
 Dont worry if you dont want to you wont see me Now what you will keep seen is the problems that you do have You got into them and are still in them since months ago Am I not right And there is a subtle mistake that you are making when addressing them Curious about what it is I will be here Sick and cruel maybe but that is only a manifestation of being plain and true no fictitious colors no hidden things Good luck with your holy war   
OMG how didnt I guess before I know who you are You left as  Dr Jekyll and you came back few days later as Mr Hyde Youre really really sick You need to get some help I feel sorry for you  
 Is it really me who is sick Maybe Sort of a different illness as your fortunately Anyway you dont want to look to what I am saying no point to so much chitchatting If you can really name my illnesses do so It is useful and I dont mind   
If youd like to get a response at the message you left at Alison talk page please remove it from there and repost to you own talk page As you rightly said Alison has nothing to do with the message that was addressed to me and her talk page should be left alone  
I asked you to delete it from Alisons talk page you only copied it Please delete it it does not belong there and well talk  
 Well it does belong there It is not only a message to you it is also a message to the other two that were there Why would I post it there if not because it completes a story only said in half I said to continue here because the rest seems to be going to be about me But notice the text there hints the readers here so that if they want to read more they know here to come If I delete that paragraph there not only info is lost there but also nothing links to the continuation here

Sole purpose Just look my at my user contributions Sorry but you are prizing yourself too much thinking that the my sole purpose is to help you It is the other way around Just by chance I noticed that your problems had not stopped since they even came to disrupt FPC You are being a bit paranoid as you were when I reviewed one of your pictures in the most impersonal and objective way as I always try to do I just happens that among the things that I see I support those that I think are right No matter what When I saw people doing wrong to you I condemned it If I see you doing wrong I tell you But not more than once You say that I need some help Go ahead tell me the symptoms that you see In my talk page since Alison should be annoyed with all these posts Abisharan talk 



Common languages are all context dependent This message is what it is within that contest Thats why I believe more in just copying

 You are Spanish 

You said edulcorantion which is close to edulcorante or sugar  Preceding unsigned comment added by 71107144106   
 I did Although it is also a word in English that means the same thing as sweetening Also chemist used for the action of rinsing a beaker with water It is a nice word specially if you already used sweetie in a previous sentence Things sound better when you dont have to repeat words
