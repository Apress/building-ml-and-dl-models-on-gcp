Oh please My sole argument with him was on the content boardwhere if youd note I agreed with what he was saying just not the manner in which he was saying it He is the one who is being abusive towards others including me he is the one who is taking opportunities to make this a battleground not me More to the point I was responding to you Saying Oh thats just how Malleus is Thats bullshit and you know it He is causing the problem and yet Im punitively blocked You have really got a strange sense of humour I simply will not stand for people making allegations about meand that is something Wikipedia needs more of not less Other people come by and read things they never look into the history and allowing bullshit such as Malleus commonly spouts to stand means that he gets to dictate reality
