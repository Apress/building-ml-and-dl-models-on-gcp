I have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of fuck  That is a total nonsequitur  I have not seen anyone here assert that there arent any ways of using fuck that are slang  The point was and remains that the standard use of the word fuck as both a noun and a verb  the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post  has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang

You used this nonsequitur as your basis for reversion  And to this day you are persisting in it  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange

As for the metadiscussion the discussion about the discussion Andys revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted  And where did he choose to raise that discussion  Over on my User Talk page  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here  Instead he moved it to an Admin page where he called for me to be blocked  Is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion  This too are questions that I do not need anyones answer to

As for your opinion that this issue is now resolved I never shared any such view  I added the See also link as a step in the right direction  Not as a cure  I cant have stated that more clearly that I STILL see the article as broken  My decision to leave here for the time being is because I see a critical mass of editors who are bent on keeping it broken my opinion  my view  Its fine if we agree to disagree but that doesnt mean that the problem has magically gone away
