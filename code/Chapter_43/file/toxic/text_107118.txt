Images Ive taken will not be removed from my user page 

This is ridiculous I am not going to be bowing to the contention that I am not allowed to use images that I myself acquired no less on my user page Fuck policy Policy is made by social people who have no better thing to do than constantly bicker amongst themselves about Policy is inherently flawed because its made by people who dedicate themselves to a bureaucracy Under copyright law I am more than well within MY FUCKING RIGHTS to use these fairuse images of MY taking in this way Wikipedia policy should be consistent with copyright law and no more My use is allowed within copyright law If you think otherwise kindly direct your concerns elsewhere Thank you
