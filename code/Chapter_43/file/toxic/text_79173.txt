Gwen Gale 

Ms Gwen Gale YOU are the one who is vilolating Wikis policy and you are abusing your powers as an editor to distribute this garbage and propaganda Your source documentation is nothing more than hearsay There are many theories which exist regarding the dispappearance of these two historical figures yet you choose to use Wikipedia as your personal sounding board I have several authors scholars and historians standing behind me to refute your claim of your sourced documentation

Vandalism is any addition removal or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor page blanking or the insertion of nonsense into articles

Ms Gale you are the one in violation fo this not I Your editing is nothing more than nonsense You are comprising the integrity of Wikipedia by refusing others to correct your hearsay and propaganda If anyone tries you banned them You are nothing more than a Wiki Nazi
