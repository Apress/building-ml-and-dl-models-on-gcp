In case Connolley deletes the message I sent him here is a copy

I request that you unblock my talk page and immediately and permanently delete the contents of it You are free to permanently block me from contributing to Wikipedia as I have no intention of doing so in any case If you would like a reason to block me or prove that I have violated the rules you need not preserve the talk page Here is another deliberate  intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an oldschool personal insult

You are a loathsome sanctimonious hypocritical ignorant twit If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them

I hope that is satisfactory

That should do the trick
