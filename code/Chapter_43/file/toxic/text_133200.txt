You are a soldier a dog of war you understand nothing of power politics You are welcome to come to Athena but rest assured my fellow Hellenes do not like people who come to our country and espouse antiGreek views You are clearly a proud American but I am a proud Greek and I will be DAMNED if the antiGreeks are going to get the better of us I bet you love good old FYROM and Albania as well Yep Americans love shitty pseudostates with no grounding in History so they have to steal it off others they would be easier to control than a strong Greece and Serbia Make no mistake though your reign is coming to an end sooner or later well drive you and the British Murderers off the island and well run the Greek Muslims so called Turkish Cypriots into the Sea
