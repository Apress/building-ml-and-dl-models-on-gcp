Who The Fck Put You In Charge

I create an account on wikipedia not 2 minutes later I receive a message expressing concern over my username I know it wasnt you and I admit to my three consecutive acts of vandalism regarding a subject I particularly hate but I looked at your history and all it seems that you do is attack people over edits and usernames Instead of acting as captain of the Wikigestapo maybe you should devote your time and energy doing something that actually really matters and get of my and other rowdy wikipedians asses We may offend occasionally but it is all in the spirit of jest So after you read this log off of your computer and go live a little Also get that dick out of your mouth
