Youre really pushing my buttons Wayne Dawson really pushing it You can do what ever the hell you like for all I care as Wikipedia is wayyyy at the bottom of my list and means NOTHING to me I can easily make a new account which you will never know about anyway so it doesnt bother me You say you want nothing to do with me yet you continue to make a fuss and create new discussions I cant belive how worked up and excited you get when some issues occur on this website you launch full on investigations and take it all so serious Get a like you pathetic looser
