Talk San Francisco Burrito 
As Wikipedia has no formal hierarchy and as you have no authority over me as an independent editor Ill go ahead and be my own judge as to what is and what is not appropriate Random pieces of profanity do not amount to personal attacks on other editors If you gave a shit you might comment on the content Instead youre wasting your time complaining about my behavior with lots of babble which amounts to nothing Fuck off for a while talk
