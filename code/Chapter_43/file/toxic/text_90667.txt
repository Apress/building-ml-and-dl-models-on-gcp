Although Ken Barnes is a fucking moron we need more criticism to balance it out
Hi As one of the primary authors of this page I want to make it absolutely clear that I in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation I added from rock critic Ken Barnes Having contributed nothing to music himself it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album Nonetheless we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out I have also added many wonderful things lately such as Freddies top listings in international polls so dont worry too much I also want to make it clear that although I cite Rolling Stone a lot I basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate Forgive me Freddie
