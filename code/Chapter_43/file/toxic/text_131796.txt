WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable

Having returned to my cozy semisecluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives With the exceptions of the location  a house  and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together The three of us tightknit friendswithbenefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together Then Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad now they were muchwelcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justines skin and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulderlength brown hair As when we were in college together she wore virtually no makeup just a thin gloss upon her lips  an enticing strawberry flavor as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening  and red fingernails Her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the welltoned thigh The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes Surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe

The conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other I took the opportunity to once again study Beth and was equally impressed While noticeably shorter than Justine Beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research As in college Beth preferred the color black for her outfits a somewhattight sweater formfitting slacks and a pair of low heels Four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril Beths black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine

It felt so good to be in their presence once again Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed together I was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder An arm wrapped around each of them I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood My eyes closed I reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time

No words were needed And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me I smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters But eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep I stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee faint yet unmistakable Justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while Beth and I held each other as she slept The feel of her pajamacovered breasts against me was a welcome sensation as it h
