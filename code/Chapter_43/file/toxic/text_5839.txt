Orangethroated males are strongest and do not form strong pair bonds instead they fight bluethroated males for their females Yellowthroated males however manage to snatch females away from them for mating
Bluethroated males are middlesized and form strong pair bonds While they are outcompeted by orangethroated males they can defend against yellowthroated ones
Yellowthroated males are smallest and their coloration mimics females Under this disguise they can approach orangethroated males though not the strongerbonding bluethroated specimens and mate while the orangethroats are engaged in fights
