Personal attacks Canvassing LOL YM is in monkey heaven right now precisely because of people like you I was waiting for you to arrive much earlier than now  Have you actually read my post on the Winter Palace which is completely calm and constructive or are you so wrapped up in yourself The fact is that most administrators here lack YMs sense of justice in favour of being popular He did not care about being in with the crowd like you Mr Vulcan but always sought to do what was best for editors Your block is the most pointless thing you can do to me and given that the issue over Winter Palace seems to be ceasing once again it extremely poorly mistimed You lack the judgement to be an adminstrator Mr Vulcan and I find it very sad indeed the only time you ever visit my tlak page is to block me The admins presiding over this case should be ridiculed for their failure to adhere to WPOWN or even warn Giano about it Only you cant take criticism so feel that a block will help wikipedia and sustain your reputation Dr Blofeld
