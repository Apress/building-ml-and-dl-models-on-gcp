Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all I mean the content wasnt as strong as say Final Fantasy VIIIs but I would imagine something was censored Plus it doesnt say anything about censorship on this page Could someone please answer to this 
Not that I recall It certainly wasnt censored as much as the older games were  
As I recall some language was censored some wasnt  
The word bastard appeared on various occasions but fuck and shit were censored  
 recet indent
Some words were censored some were not which ones seem arbitrary
Only instance I could find of Fuck uncensored
Computer Cid We have an emergency situation A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket
Cid What Who is the little fuck
Computer I dont know Activating the intercom in the engine section
Cid Hey goddammit Who the s still in there
Earliest instance of Shit
Shinra Manager Im not give in to violenceand Im not giving you my seat either
Tifa Barret
Barret  You lucky 
Cloud So what are we gonna do now
Barret Shit The hell you so calm about You bustin up my rhythm
In total Fuck is said uncensored once Shit is said uncensored 12 times ass is said 15 times sometimes occuring as Jackass Damn is said 68 times and I couldnt find any occurances of Bastard  Censored words appear approx 33 times  
My version must be different  The fuck is censored and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted the first word was uncensoredthough it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle making it shit  I noted a lot of uncensored ass and shit though and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long going back and playing FFVII I was a little surprised by the language  In fact its the only Fantasy RPG Ive ever played with uncensored profanity  But yes it was at least partially censored 
 Nevertheless unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever we cant include this in the article  er 
Well the box says its rated teen for mild language and violence  But Im not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really dont think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia  And even the slight mention is iffy to me   
Well its the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language  But then again all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of Americas censorship guidelines of the time 
It might be worth noting at least in the discussion that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version Almost every instance of shit was removed consistently with  or similar characters Also certain important lines had their translations changed Back then you could get by with only skinned knees for example was changed to something likely more grammatically correct but weird to a long time player of the PSX version  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret They were all situations of anger though so it didnt impact the storyline much

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall Slightly stretched underwear was changed to Therapeutic underwear Not sure why its better but Im pretty sure they did it because they thought slightly stretched was sexually inappropriate The item is found in Tifas dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence

Mentioning Midgars future
During the epilogue that follows the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinras operations it is now a land of lush greenery

This sentence should be removed as it is trivial unnecessary and uhhh too minor for mention and there is no explanation for this scene  NEWL
