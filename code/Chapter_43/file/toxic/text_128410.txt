By abuse administrative privileges I mean I am an administrator I am not impartial for some reason I care way too much about this article enough to spend years policing the people who disagree with me and nobody but other administrators have ever agreed with me So if I have a problem Ill just call another administrator to back me up and Ill even have somebody lock the article for me so that nobody else can have any fun  Yes this user has actually gone through other administrators undoubtedly having private conversations with them to lock this article Pages upon pages of discussions with people disagreeing with him be damned  hell get his way Its abusive and it needs to stop Find somebody else to police the article enough of this  Oh and I dont care that you dont like my personal attacks  Mangojuice is a troll 75127214162
