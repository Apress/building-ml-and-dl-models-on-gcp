Related projects is made for stuff that is somewhat more related then just having 4chans name in it The lolikon boards on not4chan was on 4chan but then changed to not4chan see the article And world4ch is managed by 4chan staff Anyways plus4chan has nothing to do with 4chan except that they actually archive some stuff and the mods have stickied it for a while If we would add all Related projects which are not run by Team 4chan the article would look shitty
