Downfall

It was common knowledge that de Molay planned on corrupting Catherine of Valois male children by tending to their sorrows then by engaging in acts of anal rape

Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay Upon escaping the vile pervert they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do

Myths

It is said that Jacques de Molay cursed Philippe le Bel and his descent from his execution pyre a curse which was responded to by Philip shouting in defiance Fuck de Molay

It has been speculated that several of the boys whom de Molay had corrupted had grown to enjoy the perversions of the homosexual lifestyle introduced to them

Legacy
