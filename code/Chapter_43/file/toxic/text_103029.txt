What How dare you call me a bloody vandal Just because I dont spend half my life on the internet doesnt mean I cant read and write and as far as I know anyone can write on Wikipedia as long as its true referenced and makes a better article If Im a vandal then why the hell did the last guy who throws that word around a bit too easily say sorry after seeing that I wasnt a vandal I get very cross when people say Yanks are closedminded because some of my good mates are from the States but you sir are a tired old cliche If you think bears attacking people are a joke then maybe thats cos Im an Aussie and here we take animal attacks pretty seriously like after the poor bugger Steve Irwin passed away So have some bloody manners for goodness sake You just ruined my afternoon
