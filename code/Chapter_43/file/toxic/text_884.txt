I TAKE OFFENSE 

I take great offense that some pompous sanctimonious twit thinks that no one should be allowed to express appreciation for women like the Gibson Girl as the finefeatured and achingly beautiful creatures that they are  

I dont know what kind of totalitarian feminazi dystopian agenda you are trying to foist on people but dont do it here  This encyclopedia is based on free speech and a free exchange of information not bogus political correctness and schoolmarmish thoughtpolicing  Ill take a Gibson Girl over you anyday
