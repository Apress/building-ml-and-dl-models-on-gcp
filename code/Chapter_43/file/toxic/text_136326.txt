Hey Fuckhead
Quit acting like the all mighty editor It is not up to you to decide whether something is adequately cited to be on Wikipedia Your argument that there cant be any orignial research is utterly ridiculous Everything is original research at one time or another Let the reader decide or bring it to the talk page before you decide Leave it alone until you are given premission by the group I think more people like the cultural references in South Park than do not So under rule of the majority leave it alone or you will be deleted
