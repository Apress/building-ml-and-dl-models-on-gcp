WPDTTR is an essay I didnt say anything about WPDTTR I pointed out what is a practice according to members of the community something I would not merely dismiss out of hand as you seem to do

At what point does an editor here pass your threshold for what constitutes a nonnewbie As for DeltaTriangle sorry I dont know how to make triangles on my keyboard I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above It was an explanation of my perception at the time and not some type of value judgment But if you really want an answer to your question Id say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement make a point of communicating with image uploaders and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community

If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages or are being deliberately churlish I didnt say anything about images being retained without a rationale I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale and if youre either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate as Im quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other peoples mouths constitutes discussion If you dont like my edit summaries then tough shit
