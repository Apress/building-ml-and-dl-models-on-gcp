Rhobite a hypocrite 

Below is what  wrote on a page discussing blocking personal attacks Bold added for emphasis

Im slightly against removing personal attacks There are too many instances of revert wars on talk pages Also people should not remove personal attacks that are directed against them  ask someone else There are too many instances of people in a dispute editing each others comments Rhobite 1821 Jun 23 2005 UTC 

Is Rhobite a hypocrite He warned me about a personal attack which I admit I probably could have worded better I removed it I then probably crossed the line making a comment about him I was just a little upset with him trying to muscle me See above He then removed those comments and blocked me for a reason which he never warned me Hypocrite I think so
