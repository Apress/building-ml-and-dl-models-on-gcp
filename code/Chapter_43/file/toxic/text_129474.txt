One last thing Tiptoety I was not a part of ED but you successfully drove me there  I opened an account a couple of days ago I honestly tried to start on a clean slate and somehow contribute to Wikipedia with a healthy portion of common sense Unfortunately I fell victim to bureaucratic masturbation which is fairly common here You people have given me the ultimate proof that admins bureaucrats checkusers etc dont know the first thing about properly investigating sockpuppets and block evaders You fling arbitrary blocks by association protect wikibullies bite newcomers guard articles based on communal POVs yes yes dont even try and deny it refuse to exercise the tiniest bit of common sense in any situation the list can go on for much longer I just dont give a fuck anymore Rest assured Ill have a new username sometime in the near future I still want to be a good contributor because I really want to make Wikipedia better as opposed to what the socalled seasoned editors do here Its like a badly run political party in here Youre the same bunch of trolls as ED the difference is that at least they admit it while you pretentiously mask yourselves as a civil community my ass This is why Wikipedia is a joke in the eyes of any serious scholar community Buhbye for now
