THE USED WORDS OPENLY MAKE THIS ARTICLE A VERY BIASED ONE

I would like the person who wrote the line that an increasing number of Turkish intellectuals support the genocide THAT HE SHOW SOME REFERENCE and PROOF  Also the SOCALLED fact that over a million Armenians are killed IS A VERY DUBIOUS ONE AND REQUIRES SOME PROOF WHAT MAKES WIKIPEDIA WIKIPEDIA IS THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A TRAGEDY AS IMMENSE AS 911 IT PRESERVES ITS NEUTRALITY HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS ARTICLE NEUTRAL IF IT SMELLS HEAVILY BIASED For example the VERY IMPORTANT START PARAPGRAPH SHOULD BE MODIFIED  LIKE  SAY 

 It is also alleged that over a million Armenians were killed during the relocation etc 

OTHERWISE  you have to show immediate references or supporting articles proofs etc I would like to receive those proofs if this is really a documented proof I very much would like to read them  
PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SOCALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS 

No academic research  conducted in Turkish Republic ever denies the fact that MANY Armenians were killed during the relocation but A MILLION IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE

Just because there are some PUNKS  Do they call themselves System of Something  who make their homelands propaganda does not mean that you can falsify the history

PLEASE REFER TO THE RESPECTED HISTORIANS MANY OF THEM ARE NOT TURKISH WHO DENY THE SOCALLED GENOCIDE

I WOULD LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROL THIS SITE CHANGE THESE BIASED LINES IMMEDIATELY
