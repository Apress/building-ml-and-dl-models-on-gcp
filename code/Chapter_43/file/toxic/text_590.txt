Another crap article 
Parrots what promotion websites of capoeira schools say about myths of origin And also that persecution thing By the late 1800s capoeira became a word for street brawling Thus authorities did not prohibit or sanction practice of capoeira In banning capoeira they were banning outright street brawls Its why Mestre Bimba presented his art as Luta Regional Baiana No decent carioca would be eager to sympathise with capoeira and malandrismo I could attempt to alter the article but its become such a mess by now
