No  This is a GROUP EFFORT  Wikipedia is a collaborative COMMUNITY and there are no school essays here  The article needs to be more professional and adopt a better title besides the references  This is all that needs to be done so get off your high horse and accomplish what you want to see done  If you have these goals then put yourself to the test of solving this problem  Thats what I do whenever something perturbs me  Youre just looking for a fight about something you admittedly care nothing about  How about I come by your house and criticise your gardens  Why You say  Because they are too fucking ugly and I dont like the way they  dont blend in with the neighbours yards  So tacky but Im only passing by and Ive never been down this road before   1524 25 Feb 2005 UTC
