The arrest of Gerry Adams isnt front page news according to Wikipedia 

If you want to know why read the WikipediaIn the newsCandidates page There you will find all sorts of uninformed illogical and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works You will also see the quite idiotic claim that by ignoring this news Wikipedia is somehow defending Adams from defamation  something apparently the rest of the worlds media and indeed Wikipedias own article on Adams isnt apparently all that concerned about If like me you think this is contemptible and want to challenge it  then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talkIn the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments will absolutely positively not answer any questions at all about it  and others will apparently defend their rights to do so by closing down such discussions Apparently its disruptive to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this As always if you want to know whats going on the world consult the other old media outlets who for all their faults still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner Only come to Wikipedia if you want to know about video games and other stuff nobody really gives a crap about
