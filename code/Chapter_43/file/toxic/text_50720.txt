Your sarcasm 

Hello Angr

I think that your recent addition to a user talk page of Your efforts to get yourself blocked from editing Wikipedia have been successful If the block expires you can come back to make constructive edits was frankly stupid You people are trying to promote yourselves as the Wikipedia elite and believe me it doesnt help your cause by writing garbage like that Stick to factual information not useless crap Thanks
