First of all SarekOfVulcan still did not get back to me to disscus civilized Instead NotARealWord added some nonsense It seems that this is your style how many 35 editors keep moving around replying to me Anyway I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES READING WHAT NotARealWord just wrote above 
NotARealWord said quote What do you mean The statement about their 100 clean award is cited Are you for real or you want to insult myusers intelligence What you have another set of policies about reliable sources and self promotion means WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT 100 CLEAN AWARD Can you answer me SAREKofVULCAN My feeling is that the guy from Softpedia entered thatwhat a reliable source Secondly what does it means 100 clean AWARED Is this award given by a reliable verifiable sourcebodyentity maybe Golden Globes NO that comes from the same reliable source softpedia And 3r THIS IS PROOF THAT AMOUNG this team of editors that are against me are some like NotARealWord which is SAREK here is another personal attack according to your definition or in a hurry to close my mouth or just incompetent 

Here is my proof  NotARealWord said the statement about their 100 clean award is cited 

And read what is on the page httpenwikipediaorgwikiSoftpedianow programs which are also freeware or open source are given Softpedias 100 Free award4nonprimary source needed

Where is your nonprimary source SAREK and Wikipedia and David Biddulph David added this fault pas in NotARealWords name
 
Regarding the 2nd point that I did not insert a name of a reliable source we debated that I inserted more sources but none is for you guys I will start to differentiate between you editors and Wikipedia in my naivet√© I still want to believe that how you act is not actually Wikipedias way to work a reliable one  

Conclusion my belief is that I cannot pinpoint orand there is a matter of incompetence from the editors part some WikipediaSoftpedia interests or just a vendetta

I still hope to hear from you SAREK to discuss this points civilized I think I am doing my part buy you dont do yours
