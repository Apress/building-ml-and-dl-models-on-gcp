If I believed you it would be fine  But what has happened for SIX MONTHS is that the article will be at least acceptable then some jagoff comes along and edits it and adds perjorative shit and I have to argue it all over again  That is unacceptable on every level  It is the cults responsibility to make sire the content is not actionable not mine  Now the cult will have to contend with something different what will they do when they are exposed at work or with family members as being part of a porn kings online cult  The conversation is fine Brad  The problem is that this shit makes me crazy because some ignorant freak will come along and quote something from here as if it were true and then I have to deal with it  No more they want to gather shit on me I will gather shit on you all
