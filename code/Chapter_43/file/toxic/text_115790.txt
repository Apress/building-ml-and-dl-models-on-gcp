THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own HELL why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody but hasnt done anything to deserve any special credit Apart from his compositions which truly arent anything brilliant  in fact theyre almost bland and boring from a compositional point of view he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant which seems to be the deluded sick biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music 

Now this deluded sick individual on YouTube MikeCaffey seems to go about praising Dick short for Richard and far more funny to refer him to that than Richard for his compositions deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others As a pianist myself I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to pianogod and even if it did Dick STILL wouldnt be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent Although they may not care whether they have a page or not I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own 

Hey  I can play Hungarian Rhapsody can I have a page
