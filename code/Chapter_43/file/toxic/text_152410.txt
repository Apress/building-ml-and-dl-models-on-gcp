Typically fanatical English nonsense Just what is wrong with you people What is it in your culture By that imperialist logic every single Irish person was British simply because the British murdered enough of us and robbed enough ie every single bit of land from us to dominate over us in our country Oh yes might is right for the British boys when they invade other lands  Charming All my grandparents were born under the British boot not one of them would have described themselves as anything but Irish In fact with much justification see above they hated the British and their notions about Ireland and the proper position of us Irish in our own country The British being what they inherently are sought to keep the Irish people in a subservient position in Ireland But by the logic of some people no doubt of the British Isles worldview if the British say we are something we must in fact be what those people say we are Yes you really are never what you really are until the British tell you what you are What a quintessentially British mentality Get a grip you shower of obnoxious imperialist arseholes Except for Six Counties and a few rocks your Empire is finished You are small fry now all that remains is the notions about yourselves  864271111
