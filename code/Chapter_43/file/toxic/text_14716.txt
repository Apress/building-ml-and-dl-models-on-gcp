SUSPICIOUS MASS EDITSIS ANY ADMINISTRATOR FOLLOWING SPYLABS EDITING

Can anybody tell me who gave the right to this guy under the pseudonym spylab to behave like the master of wikipedia deleting my comment I uploaded yesterday here and ignoring the comments of other users despite the fact they were based on wikipedia policy according to which he cannot introduce mass changes to an entry without generating a discussion first in the talk page about the changes he suggested Evidence was produced by other users to show that he LIED when he said that he did just a simple copyediting as it was shown that he deleted sentences and that he distorted the meaning of other phrases simply because he has no clue about the Inclusive Democracy projectDespite all this he comes back again and again addingdeleting and reorganizing at will this entry Has anybody appointed him to do this damaging work which far from enhancing the significance of wikipedia it creates the impression that any ignoramus can do whatever he likes with longestablished entries8616120518
