Jose Baez 

Well asshole The article was properly cited with reliable sources stating plainly he was born in Manhattan New York The source of the reliable information was the person whose article we are discussing

The articles that you have erroneosly cited as reliable are bogus and inaccurate at best Who would you believeJose Baez or some junior reporter who doesnt even cite a source for the incorrect information

Please take a moment and review the source  I cite because then you can see a picture of the subject of this article stating where he was born and not some moron stating an incorrect place of birth because of hisher laziness That sounds familiar doesnt it asshole Check sources of data before you incorrectly cite it and remove all doubt about your usefulness in the internet worldjerk6581536
