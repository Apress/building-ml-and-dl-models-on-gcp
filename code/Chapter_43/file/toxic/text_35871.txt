God damn it doesnt matter IF I DO provide proof As you will put a prorussian spin on it anyway
As you and your russian buddies did already numerous times 

The reason this prorussian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other prorussian admins are allowing this Also your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesnt help either

Tricky situatian you got yourself into here shame that I dont have the time or the motivation to meddle is pointless discussions with people who are brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing to do with Crimea by their own government 

Just open any site that isint Russia Today and youll see the real situation in Crimea and not what Ymblanter or any of your russian buddies are trying to portray here Ive had numerous discussions with prorussians and I know that you dont have the capabilities to think by yourself even If you had  Ymblanter would come in and adjust it to give a false impression of russian uninvolvement in the matter Apologists the lost of you

Have fun posting propaganda Ive already informed other admins about this editing policy abuse
