Christians were reportedly present in early demonstrations in Homs but stopped participating in them when Islamist Salafi slogans were proclaimed

do you think you fairly represented the referenced material with this edit I couldnt find in the BBC article the emphasis you put on  the material here at all is that because Im missing something or is it your POV editing the article says everyone walked off in solidarity with the Xtians and as far as I could see didnt say  they stopped participating full stop at all  
Why do you attribute those edits to me   
because in the edit history it isnt there after you edited on 2 march and then it is there after you edited on 4 march still a revealing answer in its way i guess says it all  
Read whatever you want into it who cares seems I must have mixed up different articles or something it was months ago   
 i read into it you are a liar and a twister for your POV  you got mixed up  yeah right fuck off   
This is my talk page so I think youre the one who needs to fuck off
