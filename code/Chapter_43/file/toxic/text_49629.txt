His son already mentioned on Rodgers page has gone on trial charged with serious criminal charges how exactly is writing one referenced sentence on that giving undue weight to the story Youre being entirely ridiculous and probably biased do you support LFC its an important story which has gained significant media attention Rodgers has also attended the trial Im going to continue adding this And I dont care if you abuse your discretionary powers to try and have me banned I know that I am right and that your bias is clouding your judgement Shame on you
