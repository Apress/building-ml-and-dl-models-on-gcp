There are zero reliable sources and I dont mean Youtube and Crawdaddy they are not reliable for this If theres a reliable source for the Def Leppard incident then include that in the article Personally I cant stand Danzig but thats irrelevant to producing an accurate article sourced reliably and not filled with seedy tabloid garbage You sound like someone with a bone to pick If you want gossip and sensational nonsense go read The Sun Otherwise nobody cares that Danny Lollipops deliberately provoked and then assaulted a singer backstage and then put the video online in hopes someone would listen to their awful band Considering it was 5 years ago and nobody remembers the shitty band Id say their ploy failed
