WRONG retard The good ending is not the canon ending Wheeler only said that no one knows what happened to Cybil She could have simply sneaked back into town backed up her belongings and fled town to start a new life If you had paid attention while playing SH Homecoming you would have learned that Wheeler said that The Order is one to bear a grudge They dont take kindly to people that dont share their beliefs And they are known to have the ability to track people down And in the translated book of memories Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybils fate is left to players imaginations

Also SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill Does that mean he died too NO not at all

PLEASE pay attention when you play video games 

Thank you
