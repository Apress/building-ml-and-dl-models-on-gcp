Id hoped for a better more neutral response from you but apparently you too have your own biases Even if my remarks in that in exchange were indeed especially incivil and immature which is an absolutely ridiculous proposition Id say Id at least expect you to give me the slightest bit of credit for the rather magnanimous step I took in apoligizing to Clio But no such luck

I think you may be mistaken in your assertion that Clio and myslef have buried the hatchet I may have buried the hatchet with her through my unqualified unconditional apology only to get a lukewarm okIllacceptyourapologybutyourestillwrongandImstillrightsopleasecontinuetostayawayfromme response The hatchet is only half buried at this point

As for having a giant chip on my shoulder how in Gods name can describe me in such a way after taking such an extremely magnaminous step in offering such an apology One would only hope for praise for taking such a bold magnanimous step rather than yet further insults as to immaturity My apology was indeed the most mature thing Ive ever seen on wikipedia Shame on you for giving me absolutely no credit for it Youre certainly a rather poor admin afterall Block me again if you wish if you feel Ive insulted you Ill just award myself another resilience barnstar for it
