Message What message I didnt realise Id been tried convicted and sentenced already  and purely because UserEnochlau has put up a big shiny warning Obviously its against Wikipedian rules to utter a sentence in defence of oneself Wikipedias pseudoelitism is very nasty
 My experience with Wikipedia has led me to be sympathetic to the point of view as expressed by others of Wikipedia being the concensus of the uninformed Please block me for much longer than 24 hours Im going back to the real world
