God God God 

I would to mention one BIG thing that people making this chapter missed and that thing is to LEAVE GOD ALONE Damn it people it is not all God God God God

Classical Pantheism belives in god as conscious and Naturalist believe in again God as uncoscious This is ridicilous Naturalist Pantheist believe that there is no such thing as God but unity LEave God We dont think of it as unconscious God but like one BIG UNITY Now please change the whole thing for naturalist pantheist or whatever you call them
