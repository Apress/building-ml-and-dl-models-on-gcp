You must be stuck on stupid Dmries Im not arguing about why I was blocked Im saying that ABC News has an opinion that the ad was an attack ad Its not a reliable source because it is biased and the no original research policy is a dumb policy Why would you not want to see the actual ad for yourself Oh I know Were all too stupid to figure out what the actual ad means We need ABC to break it down for us Save it You have an agenda and you wont let anyone interfere with it I feel sorry for any student who would get stuck in one of your classes They probably end up dumber for the experience
