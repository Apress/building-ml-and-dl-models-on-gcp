Ok i take your point I just dont see why you guys have to be so gay about a page like this You arent the brittania encyclopedia mostly from what i can see youre a bunch of mugs with nothing better to do then write silly articles about nothing in particular On the other hand this article is in my opinion an interesting and hopefully expanding drinking organisation We are using wikipedia to spread the word about our idea and a bunch of loser gimps are trying to stop purely because they have nothing better to do
