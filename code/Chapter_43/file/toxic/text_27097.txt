My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it This is sad that political correctness has come to this level It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior This is sad We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech This is next Truly sad Truly sad indeed 

 Also regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as china is the reason why the USs economy is in the crapper and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980s We have made those people rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling Open your eyes

And for those reasons I despise China as well as the politically correct

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wikis page on the controversial word niggardly that stupid people and words do not mix It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language As I said idiots and words can be a dangerous combination

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wikis niggardly page and was accused of vandalism yet others posted similar comments I must of hit a nerve with some idiots who dont have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage LOL
