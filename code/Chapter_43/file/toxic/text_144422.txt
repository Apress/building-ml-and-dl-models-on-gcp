Help Please An evil Wikipedia editor attacks aviation pioneers Coanda and Vuia constantly TAB 

Unfortunately an evil Wikipedia editor who uses a multitudes of names  Romanianlies Romaniantruths Binksternet Soundofmusicals Andy Dingley GraemeLeggett BilCat   and is also in the Bord of Editors so he has more power on Wikipedia that an ordinary contributor has been attacking for more than three years various aviation pioneers amongst others Traian Vuia and Henri Coanda for unknown reasons TAB 

In general as soon as he sees the two names in Wikipedia articles he immediately adds the word unsuccessful and other unjustified bad characterizations multiple timesTAB 
TABTAB 
Any attempt to delete these unfair remarks always fails and the user who dare to confront Romanianlies gets suspendedTAB 
TABTAB 
Something has to be done If you have an idea feel free to share it This man is paid with donations from Wikipedia supporters and he simply abuses his position and denigrates at will and with no justifications personalities that he does not likeTABTAB

The last contribution of this evil man under the name BilCat was at this page 
httpenwikipediaorgwikiAircraft_engine
where he added the word unsuccessful in connection with Coanda1910 planeengine making it the only unsuccessful thing in a large list of engines
