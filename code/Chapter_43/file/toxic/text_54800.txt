Last comment by you Multi has just proved your inablity to think rationally No doubt you would back up and old crap proposed as a smear The problem with you is that youre all about taking sides Learn to be your own person and make edits according to fact and relevance I barely need to list all the reasons who holocaust denial shouldnt go in that box But quickly so that you dont waste anymore of your precious editing time trying to argue for it Ill give you 3 reasons 1 Holocaust denial isnt a political ideology its a personal belief 2 Griffin has no convication for holocaust denial so you wont find a source anywhere for it 3 There WAS no source provided anyway Stop wasting our time with these silly proposals thanks
