I noticed a Tweet by you on the topic of CNNs Don Lemon that read Forget about some measure of objectivity as an anchor

I was just wondering if youre fucking retarded I mean you do know you work for Fox News right

Even if we were to limit the discussion to just you do you think it would be difficult for any person with a working cerebral cortext to find one or two hundred clips of you anchoring on Fox and expressing an opinion Oh Im sorry Not an opinion  the opinion of the Koch brothers My mistake

In conclusion Id like to offer you a great big glass of shutthefuckup juice
