ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED

Please do not delete content from articles on Wikipedia as you did to Solaris 2002 film Your edits appear to be vandalism and have been reverted If you would like to experiment please use WikipediaSandbox for test edits Thank you Ali 

What the fuck is your problem Did you even read what I deleted

DO you know what the word PLOT means

Plot does NOT mean talking about the movies trailer or what genre the movie it is A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie

Read whats in the Plot section of solaris right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot or any other section It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations
 

Heres an example dumb fuck from the solaris wiki page

The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop in contrast to Lems novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them

That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot

Jesus FUCKInG CHRIST Wiki is full of fucking morons

Delete that shit
