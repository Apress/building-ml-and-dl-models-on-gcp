REMOVE OBJECTIONABLE OFFENSIVE MATERIAL 

Who gave you the right to place that objectionable offensive material on the biography of Mikhail Tolstykh which is nothing but cheap propaganda  And then you have the audacity to say I am the one vandalizing the page  On what planet

Questionable material is not supposed to be placed on biographies a legal action could be taken  The supposed Wikipedia rules forbid it  Are you a Nazi or something  By what right do YOU break the rules and I am the one blocked from restoring a biography to its original purpose  YOU are the one who should be blocked  Something is very fishy and it stinks  I am not stupid and naive

I am going to ask nicely one last time to remove that material it has no business on that biography and you know it  Lies and distortions of the truth are unacceptable  And you have the audacity to block me when I am trying to restore a biography  Watch the international media you are going to be a star on it

Do you have the guts to stand by what you say and give your real life name
