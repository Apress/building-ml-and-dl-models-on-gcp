I am playing by the rules you need to breathe out mate How can a law suit be brought for defammation or libel when the word alleged is used and other such provisional language ok a case can be brought but having studied law myself the judge would not rule in the plaintiffs favour the plaintiffs legal rep would probably advise against bringing such a silly action in the first place if he brought a case on the basis of such ambiguous language lacking in positivity so stop overestimating and exagerrating the legal potential of this type of statement You worry too much it probably stems from ignorance of the facts in your case
