Mlpearc says he still agrees that I am unnotable for thew record and thinks I should be speedily deleted

Im an internationally known author and Holocaust scholar Amazon sells 19 of my books only four of which were selfpublished

Amazingly Mlpearc boasts on his Talk page or Wiki internal bio hes a high school drop out but DOES have his GED I suspect there is a LOT of professional rivalryin Mlpearcs mind not in the opinion of Wiki editors who way back in 2011 decided to KEEP my Wiki bio because Wiki DOES think Im notable

Mlpearcs comment above about still believing Im a nobody doesnt rankle me If there is ONE thing I am NOT insecure about its my resume and other credentials But Mlpearcs opinion that Im not notable sounds rude to me

Anybody else agree

Again THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO UNBLOCK MEItalic text I am through editing my Wiki bio Ill let Mlpearc and nonsenseferret continue to inadvertently vandalize my Wiki bio misspelling Hitler my last name TWICE etc 

I have a book to write I shouldnt be wasting my time with you clowns in here but right now Im Kindlizing my book which is boring and NOT gratifying Instead Im using the poor substitute of posting flaming new sections on my Talk page Pathetic Im pathetic

Exactly what part of GFY dont you nonreaders understand You cant ban me Im abandoning my Wiki bio to you incompetent butchers who post notes on my Talk page restating claims that Im not notable despite the 2011 KEEP determination by Wikipedia

LEAVE ME ALONE AND STOP SPAMMING MY AOL EMAIL INBOX WITH YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE ON YOUR TALK PAGE I guess I have to block your emails One good block deserves another  Henry VI Part II Shakesppeare William

GO AWAY
