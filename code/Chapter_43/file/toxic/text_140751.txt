You reported me to AIV Hilarious Thats one of the dick moves Werieth pulled too Although he only did it as he knew reporting me to SPI would have probably brought him to much attention  at that stage he was still trying to keep the whole thing quiet as it obviously benefited him Not that he need have worried  every admin that ever responded to him either at SPI or AIV took the exact same view of my socking as as you espouse here although obviously some were motivated by more than just incompetence As such its likely your report to AIV is only going to ensure their names dont get picked up and the systemsattitudesculture that cause this obviously counterproductive reaction dont get fixed  meaning that Werieth might as well try his arm at another return later It speaks volumes that youd think reverting me was remotely a good thing even though in that very same ANI theres an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasnt for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks on the basis all socking is ebil Its beyond idiotic
