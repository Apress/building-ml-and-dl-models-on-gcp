Ok first of all the reason I didnt delete the entire sentence is because his retardation is a recurring gag  Second gay jokes are also recurring gags because they appear numerous times throughout the series  I have no problem with creationists getting slammed as Im not even one myself more like creationaryevolutionist so dont play the youre just offended bullshit because its just that Bullshit  Also the throwaway gag thing does hold water because they could have had the entire episode without it  The episode would have held just as much merit and made just as much sense without that gag  Tell me how is the creationist gag essential to the plot of this or any Family Guy episode
