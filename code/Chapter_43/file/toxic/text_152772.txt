SimCopter Shenanigans
Hiya I originally followed this controversy in PC Gamer my god back when printed magazines were worth a shit so off the top of m yhead I didnt have any sites 

I remember there being a few Geocities webpages on SimCopter but by the time I had graphical internet circa 1998 it was already considered an old school game

One page I found while googling that mentions the controversy is httpwwwlangstoncomFun_People19961996CFMhtml  another is httplistssamuraicompipermailbryanslist1996December001811html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired Go figure  and here we have people trying to push the view that the Clinton years were all about tolerance What a load 

ANYWAY before I go off on a political tangent check out those sites and Ill try to find some actual SimCopter sites at some point though I get the feeling this will be a fruitless endeavor
