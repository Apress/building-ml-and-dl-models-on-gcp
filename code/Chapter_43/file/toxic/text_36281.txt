DUDE i am 53 and possess degrees in philosophy science and theologyfrom Notre Dame not from a votech where you likely went after finally getting your GED

You offer rejoinders to my points without ever having addressed them  Clearly you are unfamiliar with Pope John XXIII the pontiff who facilitated Vatican II in the early 1960s and who intentionally refused to refer to the Catholic Church as the Roman Catholic Church  It is equally patently obvious you know nothing about Father McBrien or Charles Whitehead  Are you incapable of reading above a fifthgrade level or do you just lack the capacity for intelligent thought  Whats most remarkable is that rather than take solace in your own selfassured beliefs you repeatedly return to this forum in a juvenile effort to have the last word  i have one last word for you  chill  Again grow up and grow deep  We in the Catholic Church forgive you for your obstinance and your ignorance
