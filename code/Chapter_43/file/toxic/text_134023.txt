Picture this Wikipedia user_A in China posts material that does not support the current government User_B is also in China and privately messages user_A that they will report them to the authorities as they are required by law to do Wikipedia would obviously not allow user_B to continue to help suppress the freedom of speech of User_A especially since the Law of China has no authority over Wikipedia and neither does the law of the US armed forces
You Orangemarlin are overstepping your duty you cling to your past authority like a baby clings to their blanket You have no business threatening anyone for their actions on wikipedia Your intent is purely to feel some sort of power over another person because if you were doing it out of duty you would have gone through with it without informing the second party of your actions Shame on you 642309223  2308 4
