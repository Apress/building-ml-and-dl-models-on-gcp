Cut the crap already Unless youre a pedophile you dont have anything to worry about And even then all you have to do is stay quite about it and youll be fine On Wikipedia we are focused on creating and maintaining an encyclopedia not a social networking profile If racists pedophiles murderers thieves or prostitutes find the need to announce themselves as such then they are at the wrong place Stop looking at the policy as Block on sight and instead look at it as Dont disclose controversial information about yourself or otherwise youll be blocked I think that if you look at it that way it sounds perfectly fair Its fair because this is an encyclopedia and there is no need to disclose that kind of information anywhere back
