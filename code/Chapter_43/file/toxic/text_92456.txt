Weve been over this a zillion times already  you worthless sack of shit      The rule against using personal blogs as sources has no exception for notable blogs

If you can swear  so can I

If what the blogs say about Yecke has been discussed in reliable sources  then link directly to those reliable sources and not to the blogs    We dont need the worthless personal opinions of Ding Elsberry and Sleazy PZ Myers thrown in with what comes from reliable sources

Yes  enough already
