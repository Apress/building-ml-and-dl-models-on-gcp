TVTimes images
Hi Ben Youve recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine Youve correctly tagged them as fairusemagazine but I dont think the images are being used under fairuse considerations

The tag for fairusemagazines says

It is believed that the use of lowresolution images of magazine covers to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question

The images are being used to illustrate programmes not the TVTimes magazine Therefore Id say theyre not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedias fairuse copyrights policy

Additionally the tag says To the uploader please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use as described on WikipediaImage description page as well as the source of the work and copyright information These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they dont provide the source of the work scan taken from another website etc

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles youve put them in but Id be interested in hearing your views Thanks  REDVERS 

Your quibbles of fair use are so much ridiculous pedantry and if this is the level of petty officiousness you subscribe to here Id sooner not bother Fuck you cunt
