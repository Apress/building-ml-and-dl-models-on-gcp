Thanks for your message on my talk page When I voted keep for Tom G Palmer I justified it by writing that Google returns 13500 hits for the query Tom G Palmer cato 3 Tom G Palmer alone returns 34900 hits on Google 4 So on this point my vote is not necessarily inconsistent 34900  19000
Well sure but thats weak35000 is notable but 19000 isnt Come on Thats not serious

But even if you had 50000 hits on Google I might also have refrained from voting This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article If I was in your position I would probably keep my distance from the discussion You are a primary source of information for yourself and in that sense your position might be biased I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy which applies to articles but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole I dont know and I prefer to abstain from the vote
Understandable and advice well taken and appreciated But I am a justice seeker I really dont care as much if my entry is deleted or not as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment as I perceive it Here I was many moon ago minding my own damn business and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry Interesting Then someone says its up for delete What do I care I really dont give a damn But some jerk says its nonnotable okay by meI didnt konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway and vanity Implying I did it as selfpromotion This pissed me off I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge Later many months later someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmers site Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHansHermann Hoppe Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc of the same type made by Palmer So I figure lets take a look at his entry I did so and in the ensuing VfD debate realize there are actual policies on this I studied them and thought son of a bitch I qualify By their own policies These wikinerds should not have deleted me And to top it off the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer Something aint right So instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet I did it myself nothing hidden And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time I decided this time I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it the voters will be made aware of the policies That is all If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry I dont care But what do I see Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay or has a large number of publications or has 13000 google hits voting to delete me even though I have similar criteria It makes it seem arbitrary to me So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people Nom
