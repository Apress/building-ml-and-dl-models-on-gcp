Huh actually according to WPPORN this has been an issue before an image was deleted back in 06 with the summary Image would trigger 2257 record keeping requirements While from the name of the image creampiesexjpg it was obviously a form of explicit sexual material I wonder where the line is drawn when it comes to penis images I suppose its time to ask someone at the Foundation 2Δs
