If you see this message Wikipedias talk system is terrible feel free to direct me to the appropriate response method because those talkback tags are 100 confusing

Anyway I only edit pages with contributions I think will help hence the Code Lyoko comment which is why my contribs page is shallow that and my IP address changed during a thunderstorm a few months ago  Im not here to write a book if I was that into editing I would be a member by now  All I know is I called bullshit and got harassed for it by that person and now Im calling double bullshit

Its a shame you cant even go on Wikipedia anymore without being harassed
