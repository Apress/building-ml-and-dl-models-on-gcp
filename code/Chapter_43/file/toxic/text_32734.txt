Bullshit  The Bolshies grain requisitions were much greater than those carried out by the Whites and also had the effect of disincentivizing grain production by the peasants  It was this secondary effect that caused the famine because so much of the land was allowed to stay fallow  As for Davies et al they are probably relying on official data from the Soviet government that was purposely falsified to disinform the people 67169177176
