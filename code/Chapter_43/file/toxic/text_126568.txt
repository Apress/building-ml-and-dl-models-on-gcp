Will you help me rephrase my comment as a civil criticism  Since youre like a professional Wikipedia contributor or some shit bahahahabet that pays real well huh  Basically in my civil criticism Id like to communicate that this Tgeairn douche bag is a huge ass hat he wastes his life on this punchline of a website playing hall monitor  Its like he wasnt loved as a child or wasnt cool enough  to be a hall monitor as a kid  Id also like to express how he enjoys making love to various domesticated and nondomesticated animals on a regular basis and also spills his seed on other Wikipedia poindexters every once in a while  As a professional Wikipedia user bahahahahahahha can you help me a n00b express this as part of a civil criticism  Id really like this Tgeairn ass hat to feel really bad about his life choices as a result thats my goal  Thanks Tgeairn
