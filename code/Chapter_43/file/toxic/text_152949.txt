What a bloody damn joke  We have half a dozen censors ready to spend many hours until whats left of the article is all of 4 sentences long and relates ZERO about an ogoing public fraud The SINGULAR contributor has been chased away and AFTER said half dozen censors have done their badgehunting work what is left

And a body cant say squat about the fully licensed Kleargear lawyer scamming people every freakin day Thats Wikipedia censorship and to join this club is to lose all ethics completely Take a bow boyos

I keep asking the question and NOBODY will answer it WHO thinks Kleargear is NOT a fraud  If a body is accepting the obvious then WHY are censors bending over backward to censor every word
