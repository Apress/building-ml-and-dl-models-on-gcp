you will be reported as a racist 

 you are obviously a bigoted racist as you have not removed the page for Gordon name which is an article about a name Yet you are removing articles about names of people from a nation you clearly have something against

 But it does not surprise me at all Most people who deal with IT are of a limited intellectual capacity especially when it copmes to evaluating their own shortcomings cf httpblogstelegraphcouknewskateconnolly3637231Are_you_a_Fachidiot  and even more so when they have not actually graduated from a university but are selftaugt like you appear to be

 In any case your blatant Serbophobia in removing start up articles about the names of a culture that you disparage is a disgrace to Wikipedia in English

 BTW I deleted the nonsense you posted on my talk page Do not do that ever again It is unwanted and unacceptable I will not be posting here any more either and I will report you to Meta Wiki as a racist unfit to work on the site
