COI and AFD 

I wont bother to join Wikipedia to delete your vanity spam cruft Dan  I am not a banned user still got the evidence for that despite the months of unremitting cyberattacks but on principle I will not join  I will provide sufficient evident to assure that your the hypocrisy behind your abusive attacks for COI against others whilst applying alternative rules to yourself is known  If you erase it here Ill make a new site and post it to other places where persons can come and view it  Jigs up Dan  And  please do come on my machine use whatever tracking tools possible via Applecom and G  I need some more forensics  I think you are onboard with the fact that the attacks are serious matters in continental Europe and the United States as well as being copied to the UK authorities  So please do come on my computer  or arrange for some hackers to do it the FBISSA CD told me that was how it was done but he just didnt tell me who and how  Im sure that this can all be brought out if needed  Just give us all the material to make that possible
 Oh and ps Your three spam cruft articles are going to go  Booksmart was subsumed by Adobes new products  You are not notable Dan  Wikipedia is not to be used for selfadvertising  Your hypocrisy was never ok  Neither the bullying 
 Please come on my computer  I need more forensics  Or send over some kiddie hackers  We can catch them and have them squeal on you  If they come from some small country somewhere I can have a regional office of my former employer help to procure evidence and testimony  With great pleasure  If not the US Government  At this point everyone is embarassed to pieces by you guys  And then theres those subpoenas of G  208549428
