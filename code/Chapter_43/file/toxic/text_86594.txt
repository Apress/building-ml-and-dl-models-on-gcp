WHAT THE HELL ARE HOPE STILL DOING IN THE COMPETITION Its so obvious that the public dont like them because theyve been in the bottom two three times now It doesnt matter how bloody good you are if noone likes you then noones gonna buy your singles Beverly sounded a lot worse over the TV than what the judges were hearing  they loved her performance when it sounded terrible from where I was sitting On a firmly positive note Same Difference were seriously good tonight I have finally been wonover by those two because they actually delivered a decent vocal performace rather than larked around with props on stage Rhydian was soso tonight in my opinion he can do a lot better than that because his performance wasnt original Niki as well lost it halfway through her song and it sounded rough Im starting to like Leon a lot now Hes a better jazzsinger than a pop singer hopefully we wont have another Ray Quinn on our hands Ive got to say though I loved the whole deadlock thing it was so dramatic and the suspense was way better than the normal voting
