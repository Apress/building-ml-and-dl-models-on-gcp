Wait  Youre not going to block me for posting an RFC

Or did you block me just so that I couldnt go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant

See  Theres the problem As a nonadmin I am liable to be blackballed by admins some of whom suffer from Projection or do they merely think sophistry is administration

I performed no personal attacks  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power
I was personally attacked No admins have been blocked

I was not trolling  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact  Its an attempt to fabricate evidence for a block
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence because now I am blocked And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption

There are 17000 admins on this thing  I have no illusion that all 1700 of them will be right all the time  The first 20 who saw Chooserrs postings may have said okay by me  Its the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones  Meanwhile a wellmeaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong demonized in the community and the community is thrown into dysfunction  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness intimidation sophistry and dismissive attitude followed by an abuse of power

Do not block me  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps error rather than taking a skeptical attitude  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it
