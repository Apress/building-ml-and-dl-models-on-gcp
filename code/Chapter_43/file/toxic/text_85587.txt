The gender gap will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on The only cultural bias Wikipedia has is that it is biased towards objectively important subjects such as science which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all The undue coverage of women comes from the fact that there are less notable women Insisting on equal coverage of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and nonnotable people The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women such as illconceived politeness will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done
