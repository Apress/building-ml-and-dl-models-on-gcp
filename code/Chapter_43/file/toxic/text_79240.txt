UserBagumba I would like to know how using another account is wrong I was not abusing it I never got into another fight with an editor I was just minding my own business and never got into any edit wars making useful contributions I do not like this vaselineeeee account I screwed up this name and everyone would be watching me like a hawk for one stupid mistake I want to start fresh and show that I am useful without having everyone down my back
