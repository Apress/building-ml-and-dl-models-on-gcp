Just to put you in the picture Trident13 the tone is nothing unusual for Dingley Hes got a long history Being sarcasticpatronizingabusivecontemptuous makes him feel good He does it a lot Funny thing is though when he decides hes a victim of it he runs crying like a toddler whos just dropped his icecream to the notice board demanding people be banned Hes always telling others how to behave but he doesnt think the rules apply to him Selfesteem problems He wont read WPAGF of course because as youve probably noticed he already knows everything Take no notice of the sad fucker
