Hey 

First its between me and idiot so please dont get involved ok

I had added information to the Snopes article that I not only verified but then provided information on the talk page on how to do so Instead of checking the talk page though lazy idiot just hits revert and goes back to eating chips off hisher chest

Unfortunately that seems to be all too common around here  Ive read countless bitching sessions posted by other people added constructive and meaningful information only to have some lazy jerk remove it on a whim without even bothering to see what it was
