What is this admins swooping down and gang banging me just because it helps build your wiki juice  Just because I ask the all political biographies to use the same tone style general treatment as the Obama bio  I wanted all the bios to be EQUALLY teated and I GET BANNED AND SLAPPED down by the DCCC LOVERS The process is fundamentally unfair and stink of a kangaroo court  This just plain railroading kafka pure and simple WIKPEIDA IS FUNDAMENTALLY in regards to political biographies and other political subjects bias and pro liberal SO BE IT but I as a US citizen I  dont have to see Wikipeida enjoy tax exempt status You can BLOG all you want but the US tax payer dont have to pay  SO WTG you now have I will be filling out a IRS compliant form which will challenges WIKI nonprofit status under rule 501 c 3  I will state there fundamental political bias see IRS Complaint Process here  and form  Form 13909 any cursory review of Barak Obamas and other democratic biographies and compare them to corresponding republican bios and there will be uncover a fundamental biaswhich will cause the IRS to look closly at wikipeida
