Axeman 10 says I didnt vandalize ACDCs page they did perform a song called Big Balls it was released in 1976 but they did perform it at that concert in 1979 i didnt make an inappropriate edit at all do you even know anything about ACDC I really dont care ban me ive done nothing wrong and ill just change my IP Address and get a new account if it comes down to it so just come on and ban me and continue to live in your little fairytale land since apparently it makes you feel more important in life because youre an admin whoopee

Update from Axeman 10 It wasnt a personal attack on you Scarian this is the only way im able to reply to your annoying warnings just ban me already you pathetic loser i told you all you need to know youre just stuck is this sad little fantasyland where everythings overlypolitically correct just ban me already and stop messaging me i dont respect you or any other admin
