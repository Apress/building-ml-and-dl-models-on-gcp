Stupid 

As soon as I saw the phrase metal is stupid at the very beginning of the article I assumed I misread it When I confirmed that it did indeed say metal is stupid I then assumed it was vandalism However I dont know anything about chemistry See Soviet education system so if the word stupid has some other meaning in chemistry I would have no way of knowing or refuting it Could someone that actually has some amount of knowledge on this subject confirm whether this is or is not vandalism or a typo or whathaveyou
