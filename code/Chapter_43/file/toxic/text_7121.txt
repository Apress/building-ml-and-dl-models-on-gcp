Is Deepak the ruler of the world 

Let me give you people who love this guygirl DeepakAn idea of what Deepak is likeHe must be some really unhappy personi promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info or about editing an article or about taking something out of an article 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit I remind him that i backed up what i said That i had information that was logical And why my edits are good 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult every accustation  and every put down that Deepak gives me And then i remind him of why my edits are valid

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll Or a nazi lover Or other insults 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer Why does he not give me logic in return 

And Deepak wont reply  

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid And some answer and some agree and some dont 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding againwith logic Nowith answers nowith reasoning nowith information nohe tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then  

I then answer all of Deepaks insults I remind him of why i want edits to be made I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll and a nazi and a pro India dude 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and onyou get the ideahe ignores information you give him He picks and chooses what he wants to answer And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes But he wastes his time in name calling and insluts and putting you down then 

So then after a while i get annoyed And i remind him how things got this bad between us I type and type and type and type just like i am now 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit or whatever it is im bringing up thenand no matter how much i writeeven if i write these long replies to him theneven if i answer every point he brings uphe usually either ignores most of what i wrote downorhe picks and chooses what he wants to answerorhe just responds back by calling me a troll or accusing me of being pro nazi or something or accusing me of ignoring his points which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me or just accusing me of being pro India then which I am or just insulting me or just name calling me or just putting me down 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus hes this a guy here then with me now and so i start to call him names I call him a dictator I call him the ruler of wikiepdia And I tell him how he ignores my points 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names and how i cant throw mud at him and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then How come its ok for him to break Wikipedias rules but I cant then 

And Deepak has no logical answerorhe wont respond to those questions that I ask him then  Or he just ignores what i ask him and goes back to accusing me of being a troll or acting like im a pro nazi or something then  or just insults me in general then

So then I get more annoyed and call him things like a dictator which as you can see here with our history this is how he actsisnt it truehe ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answersometimes he wont even answer you at alland sometimes he just insults you then  So its logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right

WrongDeepak then holds it against you that your name calling himand threatens to block you or report you or he just tel
