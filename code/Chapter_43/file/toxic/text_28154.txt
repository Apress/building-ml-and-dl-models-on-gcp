Crusades
Hey S Schulz amigo stop screwing around with legitimate edits  I put thus and CE in the Crusades piece and you called it vadalism  How is that  If you object to use of CE then suggest AD but it seems to me that any piece that deals with events in the 9th century should tell readers if you are talking AD or BC  And I dont know who put word Jason in the article but if your point in editing that was to refer to vandalism make very sure you dont overreach and call everything you take out as vandalism  You paint too wide a path when you do that and its a misnomer  So stop screwing around and get with the script  rossp
