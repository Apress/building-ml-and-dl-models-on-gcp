Your ignorance disturbs me I am not just some guy and if I were not professionally trained in history I would not continue on arguing with you But you will agree that we are all humans on the internet I was pointing out the absurdity of that statement And Adam if I were trolling you I would be stupid in the field of the Crusades which I am not I have no desire to piss you off If I am insulting you please let your rage out on my user talk page Silverwhistle I couldnt care less how much you like Conrad but you have no need to defend him I still think he was a jerk Besides if he never came to Tyre Saladin would have spared the population and probably 100 years of bloodshed and perhaps the gay crusade would never have taken place Perhaps a thousand years of bloodshed would never have taken place It was unfortunate that Guy of Lusignan was weak enough to listen to Reynald but Conrads interference only intensified the conflict I suggest we get back on the topic of Humphrey and how we can better this article Again please take this to my user page if you truly hate my guts
