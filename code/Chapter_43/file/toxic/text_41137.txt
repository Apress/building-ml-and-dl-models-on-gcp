A Blast from the past

I was interested to read in your hidden DXRAW talk page that not long before you changed your name the following message was posted

WHY DID YOU REMOVE MY EDIT YOU CANCER RIDDEN CUNT IT WAS CORRECT BUT YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT WHO CHANGES ANYTHING YOU DONT LIKE

On reading the details of the Nicholas Saunders professor deletion debate I see that you havent changed one little bit How does it feel to be the mosted despised editor on Wikipedia You can change your name as often as you like but nothing will help your social skills
