31 hours appears rather mild 

Fucking replied May I direct your attention to the fact that alcohol wears off faster than that However its a good excuse not to show up any earlier And maybe to think whether I shoudnt always be drinking when I post Navou definitely is a badfaithed troll Its Majorly were talking about right He doesnt feel comfortable with Majorly wielding the admin tools right Well the alc made me speak my mind Maybe thats not such a bad thing Just avoid thinking about it when youre sober So 31 hours appears just right Not appealing the block in any way Im guilty as hell
