what kind of joke is this 

you guys are like jokes came out of movies
armenian pontic assyrian
what is next
lets see hmm
german genocideyep during ww1 those who wanted to be on side of allies killed millions of germans
british genocide in the war of gallipoli we killed hundreds of thousands britons systematically
french genocide yes we killed them too
kurdish genocide you know we always kill them cause they are freedom fighters
red indisn genocide we were the ones killed millions of native americans actually

just because we didnt assimilated these people we are accused of this things
we should have colonized all of them just like britons and the french ohh algeria didnt deserve its independence right

all of armenians greeks assyrians jews turks kurds whatever they all lived peacefully for thousands of year and they still live if any of these people try to split the country which some of them did in the past they paid this with their life dont think turks didnt affected by this those of you still think there is genocides by turks to other minorities have to read memoirs by armenian grandmothers greeks grandfathers living in turkey i bet youll find interesting things
