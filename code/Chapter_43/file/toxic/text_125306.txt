This website is really joke One of your editors Sam asked me if I wanted to get down in the weeds Charming and called me ignorant for correcting him Charming again Yet my response of calling him catty and vapid is a nono LOL He pursued me on the Columbus was a Spaniard section for changing the word leader to president Come on you people Youre the worst offenders here It isnt the first time your editors can dish it but cant take it Ive seen you guys pick on others as well Your website is a awful And I assure you that teachers insist that their students avoid Wiki at all costs And rightfully so If you want to see a mess just look at how the Columbus Physical Appearance section is written Since when is an artist an author ROTFwiki PS Find something better to do with Peter Lupus like play with his muscle
