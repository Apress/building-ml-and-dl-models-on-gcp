As for the arguements that abo should be included  it already is Wanker is used alot but only as a common noun and the usuage isnt unique Same for the other words mentioned

Though other commonwealth countries such as new zealand may use cunt in a similar fashion Australians do seem to use it more However this arguement is irrelevent since many Australian words such as mate bloke etc are used extensively in NZ and the UK though are still in the article
