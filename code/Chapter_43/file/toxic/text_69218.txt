You said 24 hours to Mewulwe for personal attacks on this page dishonest liar and troll An admin board is not a freefire zone Mewulwe was asked to withdraw the term liar but he refused To be exact I did not use the term liar but lying and only after Caden used that same term against me first Now my question is are the terms dishonest lying and troll against other users per se regarded as inadmissible personal attacks or am I accused of using these terms here without justification Certainly the fact that the user Caden was lying is trivially verifiable he never made any edit except one brief vote on TalkEast Germany and the dishonest behaviour of Darkness Shines who himself reverted 5 times while launching a complaint against me reverting 3 times plus making further obviously dishonest statements throughout the complaint should be equally manifest
