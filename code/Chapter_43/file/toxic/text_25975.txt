LOL  you thought your sources  including the TBR were more reliable than Boxing News You know nothing about boxing

Youre also a fucking liar

The jokes that is Ring magazine uses caps which contradicts your own personal format httpringtvcraveonlinecomratingssupermiddleweight

WBC varies and uses yet another format httpwbcboxingcomwbcengchampions

WBO using fucking hypens here in yet another format httpwwwwboboxingcomourchampions

Your sources are all over the place with formats you stupid bastard LOL

Boxing News is far more credible and consistent

More correct sources fuckwit
