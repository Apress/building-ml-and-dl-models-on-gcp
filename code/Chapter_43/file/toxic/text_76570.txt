So if someone stands up to your bullying their work is a piece of shit Like I said appalling Nevertheless I dont mind telling you that I have tried in the past while doing the primary work on the article to use block quotes for precisely the purpose you suggest I am tempted to say great minds think alike but I will restrain myself but I could not get that function to work unless the text was up against the left margin and as you know one of the shitty aspects of the article is my use of tables and images of which I happen to be rather proud If you know how block quotes can be used in this situation I would welcome your helpful advice I value clarity as much as you do
