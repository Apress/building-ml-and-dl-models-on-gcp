Small minded and ignorant Wiki contributors 

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of  Thus when I spot an inconsitency in their pieces and add some correct and especially logical words to their precious piece they get their knickers in a twist and childishly erase my effort and thus leave all other Wiki readers just as ignorant as they themselves

This is Fascism and more fitting to Hitlers Germany or Stalins Russia that the wide world of today

I will nevertheless continue to add subtract or otherwise modify and improve various Wiki articles I find as part of my conviction that eductaion should be progressive not regressive
