Now hear this Somchai Sun cracker   Some of us here on Wikipedia are not caught up in the racist swindle of using the word Islamism  There is nothing wrong with wanting to delete this page that is not censorship but respect for encyclopedic knowledge whereas you worshiper of authority want to kiss the ass of all the white scum antiMuslim prowar intellectual nobodies who want to turn wikipedia into the National Enquirer or some kind of British tabloid  We wont stand for it so dont bother coming back you simple antiSemitic pseudojournalistic charlatan     31 July 2014
