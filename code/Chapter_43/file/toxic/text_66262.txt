This talk of the article being a hoax is a lie Someone placed Vitus name into a fake article about Sacred Skull order and then everything that was also attached to vitus got destroyed believing that it was a hoax it all went through the grinder but that is bullshit there is no hoax with anything attached to the vitus person except that his name was unfairly put into that bogus society article Go to wwwavoisioncom and punch in what people said about him when he took on his title those are the pople that looked to make trouble withthe guy on wikipdeia now if anyone writes about any topic related to this guy they are labled as a hoaxer but every peice of work I have written on is verifiable by the sources given and is truthful Why should anyone put up with this constant accusation of hoaxing there is no hoax except for people placing the guys name into a bogus Sacred Skull order article why should eveything else be destroyed too This is bullshit and Im sick and tired of that
