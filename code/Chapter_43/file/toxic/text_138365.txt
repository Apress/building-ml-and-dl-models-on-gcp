The goddess is defined by Abraham ARE YOU KIDDING ME 

There are any multitude of things that amuse me about wikipedia these days but the concept that the GODDESS is defined in ABHRAMIDIC terms is just so completely rediculous as to make me giggle

Could we PLEASE get some definitions of goddess here that DONt reference the boring staid religions of antiquity  Thank you
