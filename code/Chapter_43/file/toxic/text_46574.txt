Unwarranted remarks 
hello  First of all Im very well aware of 3RR and secondly you should be aware that I did NOT reach 3RR or violate anything  Thirdly it would be nice for consistencys sake but since I see favoritism and politics at work here that you would give that same lecture to Malik  Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh 3RR  Of course you didnt per your bias in favor of him for some reason a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users and sided with his nonsense that somehow ICGC was somehow not notable  Never mind that theyve been all over tv talk shows for years guests on interviews and in the radio and even in the news  Never mind that theyve been around for decades  And have internet sites for years  Youll kneejerkly take Maliks side on this because after all hes Malik Shabaz  A bully on Wikipedia who is revert happy and for some reason you favor  I do NOT appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page   I did not violate anything NOTHING  But Malik was arguably violating I dont like and no own  Youll deny that because after all hes Malik  And for whatever reason whatever he does or says you admin or not seem to kneejerkly side with  So now that Malik has obvious backup for his bullying and ownership violations backup from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesnt bode well for me does it its hard for me to do anything  Yes Im angry  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary  I violated nothing  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles as is seen from his history and pattern  Yet you wink at it or deny that because well hes Malik  Good day
