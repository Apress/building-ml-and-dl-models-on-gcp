Hi Pompous Ass   

I know you think youre some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia and that its somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on whats acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here but guess what Thats not the case You are one of MANY arrogant conceited selfabsorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of selfesteem builder because here you can act like a big man and make unilateral decisions on whats acceptable or unacceptable here

The edits I have made and will continue to make on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesnt violate policy in ANY way If I had the time or the inclination I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything pokerrelated on Wikipedia You are not and you will not censor me And as Im sure youve already realized my ISP address constantly changes so you wont be able to block me either
