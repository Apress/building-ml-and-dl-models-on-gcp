To UserSennen goroshi Well you could have at least used terms such as bullcrap horsecrap cowcrap or any other less offending words than bullst whatever the lame drama you witnessed And you just said a single fking wordDo you feel like a grown man when you use that kind of language There could be some children refering to Wikipedia for hisher homework and I dont want them to learn foul languages here
 I do not know what this wikilawyering that I have supposed to be doing according to you I only could find that it is a pejorative term Could you explain to me an ignorant user who is new to Wikipedia that exactly what behavior of mine is wikilawyering
 Why do you have to say things like just to shut you up or you would waste so much of the other editors time You are hurting my feelings It is uncalled for I am a delicate sensitive guy _
 Wikipedia articles are made by editors gaining consensus  this process is something that you do not seem to have any respect for  Have a look at the policy WikipediaPolling is not a substitute for discussion You say this process is something that you do not seem to have any respect for but notice that I am the one who officially started a consensusgathering effort at  and you have not even participated in it
 WikipediaLamest edit wars What a valuable piece of information that I have not noticed So what I dont see this discussion included in that category By saying that you are not offending every editors who participated in and worked hard for this discussion are you
