I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following American English is quite simply English for the stupid man and of course your country would require it Your version of English is oversimplified 
I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way Why shouldnt you accept our spelling
 Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot I think not 0904 17
