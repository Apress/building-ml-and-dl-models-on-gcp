stop stupid acusations 
I find it unacceptable to delete peoples contribution without any comments I have now been repeated acused of writing a long rant while all my modifications thereof have been reverted 

There is no OFFICIAL evidence incriminating Osama as the eavil doer 
This reenforces why all acusations of muslim terrorist attack should have proper quotation
If you lack such sources which I claim you do we do not need your opinion to provide the rest of reality

Your lies as the truth here in wikipedia
The suggestion there would be sufficient proof or even mainsteam consensus about the event is a clear lie I personally find it unimaginable that wikipedia has a page where Muslim Extremists are claimed to be the cause leaving no room for any sensible explaination

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence This was the main embodyment of the attack Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder

FOLLOW THE MONEY
The page should mention Lary Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks Thus he cashed in multiple times

the muslim extreamist terrorists label kit
A discussion about using the word Terrorist seems to provide an interesting vessle to obstruct the discussion It has repeatedly been made clear the word terrorist attack can be used to explain the event but there is no ground to keep calling those who staged the event muslim extreamist terrorists
