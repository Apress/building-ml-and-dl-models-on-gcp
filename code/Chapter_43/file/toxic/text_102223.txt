I dont edit Wikipedia as I am no longer a virgin and I have a life
You reverted an edit of mine on the Lily Allen DISCUSSION page
If you revert something I wrote I dont give a shit and you dont have
to tell me I could care less Just delete it and move on
And of course my comment was unconstructive it wasnt meant to be constructive 
And quite frankly every single Wikipedia editor and administrator I have met
are extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeme losers with no lives who speak about frivilous crap
like Lily Allen as if anyone actually gave a shit 

Let me take you out for a drink or to the strip club or something and show
you how HUMAN BEINGS spend their time 7514821
