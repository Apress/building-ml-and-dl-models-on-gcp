I just wanted you to know that youre worthless 

Why did you make changes to the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute article  You probably arent even Canadian and to think that you can remove something that is very important to LCI history is unfathomable  It would make me very happy if you killed yourself sometime today or tomorrow as you are no longer needed on Wikipedia  Thank you for your time
