You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site 

This is just plain sad I am a susbcriber to Janes Intelligence online and I found the article easily you need to be a subscriber to access it but it is certainly not hard to find If you tally up the total UDAUVFLVF killed in the book lost lives from 19681998 it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period The book The Irish War also gives the number of 90 on the page I quoted as does the Janes intelligence report That is THREE sources to the one source you quote I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some halfassed administrator who cant deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator you should be recieving an Email from him shortly Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked I suggest you either stop reediting my article or merge my facts with your own I am pissed that I took the time to resubmit the article in the way you asked and you are still throwing a hissy fit You are one of the worst administrators I have ever dealt with you are the reason academics dont respect Wikipedia 

PS I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter and therefore cant deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDAUVFLVF membersbut those are the historical facts grow up and deal with it

I will repost my article daily to ensure that people who want a relaible article can have one
