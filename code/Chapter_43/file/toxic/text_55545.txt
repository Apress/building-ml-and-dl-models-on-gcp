Blocking Mardyks 2012 

Excellent work there Shii We cant have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies We insulted him offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant BLOCK those Mother Fukkers Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also There may be others of his kind that sympathize with those Indians These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah use that as the title of the page And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section Not a single scholar or Mayanist agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about We can get away with it by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets so let us know how many you want FREE popcorn too Whoopee Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 9712326228
