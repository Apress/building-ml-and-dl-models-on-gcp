How dare you call ME the vandal or a Yankees fan I am neither Paul Byrd does have a pig nose and closely resembles a swine so that is why I made those edits It was considered to be original research by other users which is why it was reverted You are the one adding disgusting things about filthy accidents that have no place on Wikipedia Your efforts to appear as a nonvandal just go to show what a true vanalism lover you really are Stop arguing with me and leave me alone I will be watching you and your future edits so I might quickly stop more of your vandalisms in the future Also you will take me off your wall of shame or else I will bring your vandalisms to the attention of people less reasonable than I I suggest you cooperate
