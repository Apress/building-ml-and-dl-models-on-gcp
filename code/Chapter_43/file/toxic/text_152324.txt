My assertion was not that alot of people read the blog but that it is a relatively popular blog meaning that it is popular enough to garner articles on the websites of Collegehumor PCmag and NPR I apologize if a simple checking of blog hits is not enough to endow something with the long coveted notable status which you so graciously endow You misquote me further I did not call Wikipedia a clusterfucked internet bureaucracy I was referring to the system which allows certain users to override others simply based on their own personal experience without any further insight Listen I understand that you do have to prevent spam on this website I know that anyone could come in here and edit the page of a noted dignitary or president to say FUCK FUCK BBOOOBIES POOP but my posting was relevant enough to instigate investigation and your deletion of it amounts to an ego trip in that it simply regards the information I posted as irrelevant despite the fact that my previous posting of it on this website lasted for months before being taken down I assure you I am not trying to spam up or fill the already expansive page about Marmaduke with misinformation I simply want to let people know about a blog I enjoy which is critical of Marmaduke I am acting in extremely good faith and have all the freedom to call the levels of bureaucracy on wikipedia a clusterfuck and to call your edits an ego trip God forbid I should question your authority on the subject I would appreciate it if you didnt try to condescend me

Thank you
