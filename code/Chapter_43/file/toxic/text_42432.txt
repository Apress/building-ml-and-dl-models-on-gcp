Image caption  Homosexual 

The second image of an infected persons back has a caption which reads
A 23yearold homosexual man had an intensely pruritic papulonodular eruption over his arms and back

How is the fact that the man is homosexual relevant The sexual orientation does not change the course of the desease and I believe that the comment could enforce the stereotype that homosexual people are all infected with STDs
I think it should just say A 23yearold man
