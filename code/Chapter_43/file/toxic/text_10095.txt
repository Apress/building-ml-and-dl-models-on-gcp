Hello again Tdadamemd Getting right to your comment about slang I dont understand your stating that fuck is not slang or your linking to dictionarycom as proof that it is not The word fuck while vulgar is also slang the dictionarycom source you cited even states so It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things including sexual intercourseother sexual activity It list 13 numbered examples regarding what fuck can mean As for Wiktionary I dont refer to sources like that And yes I am fine with mentioning fuck or fucking and the euphemism sleeping together lower in the article in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section as alternative words for sexual intercoursesexual activity But again there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse most of them slang That these terms exist doesnt mean that all of them should be in this article In fact most times when there are many alternative terms for a word especially if those terms are slang we dont include all of them As you know this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary 

If WPCONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal Ill add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar andor slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourseother sexual activitysuch as fuck and sleeping together the wording wont be exactly like that of course And really because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse and fuck is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse by that I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word fuck when discussing sexual intercourse that is probably why fuck isnt currently in this article Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that fuck is also UScentric so thats also something to think about though the term is also used outside of the United States 

Also sexual intercourse does not  fuck Its that fuck  sexual intercourse in its literal sense anyway since when people use the termthey are usually using it as profanity That is also why I told you The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic However the term fuck is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesnt currently include fuck But like I stated I dont mind adding it to the article Id rather see what others have to state on that matter first however
