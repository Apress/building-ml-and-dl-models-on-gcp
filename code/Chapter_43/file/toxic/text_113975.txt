Im not really sure where to respond but here goes anyway  I dont see how pointing out a fact is racist  If I was to point out that African Americans have darker skin than whites would I be deemed a racist  I dont think so  It is a fact that the KKK was formed to protect white Southerners from Blacks and Northerners during the rape of the South that ensued the Civil War  Do you really believe it was formed by a bunch of slack jawed yokels to hate on Blacks  Sure racism was a part of it but it was not the defining birthmark of the KKK
