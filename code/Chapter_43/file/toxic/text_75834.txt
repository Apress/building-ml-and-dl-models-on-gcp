You idiot ever since I first heard of Santa when I was 4 years old I NEVER believed he was real Any kid who is SMART AND LOGICAL would never believe it either My parents never gave me stupid delusions of it either I used to go around my 2ndgrade class and say Santa wasnt real and the teacher told me to stop but I didnt You are preventing children from developing their logical thinking skills if you tell them its possible to travel to every household in Christendom in a single night Considering in TV and movies Santa spends at least a few minutes inside a house delivering presents and eating cookies The time doesnt add up Those were my exact thoughts at 4 years old and thats how I deduced he couldnt be real If your kid doesnt think like that hes retarded and youre not helping him by saying thats possible
