Also everything you linked to Dennis Brown was quite obviously meant as humor ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN 

Dont Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour Perhaps you didnt find them funny but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated socalled Coal Wars I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coals Health and Environmental Effects I wasnt taking an unreasonable position and you will now see that thanks to my tireless thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia that information is now in the lead on Coal not through reverts by me but by others who agreed with my position I have not edited coal since my block so Im not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I havent gone back to doing

Also I did not harrass Flyer22 She harrassed me May I relate the course of events  which you may verify First of all I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so Second of all she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her Happiness article under the section Philsoophy of Happiness Arguably as other editors agreed Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsches moral philosophy on this topic No it wasnt perfect and the referencing could have used improvement but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat onesided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness Flyer22 reverted my edit giving a basically spurious reason Unsourced as I recall But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy by general and academic consensus the SEP It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free peerreviewed academically rigorous resource

Then withouit provocation after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness including similar statured luminaries like Augustine Aquinas Aristotle Mill etc she responded not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit but by telling me ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR PURE AND SIMPLE YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR I thought this was rather rude and ignorant especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits when Hume was not under discussion telling me your edits on Hume largely consit of such readpoor edits and Im tempted to revert them Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation I gave in to the temptation myself and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia Within hours a throng of rebellion began to emerge a grassroots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the muchloved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia Editors rushed to my defense I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that contra her opinion my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all She declined and escalated her attacks She was the one who harrassed me and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice   Kingshowman
