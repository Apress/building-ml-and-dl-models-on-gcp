One guy seemingly some sort of administrator deleted my contribution of fifty minutes worth of edits I went to his user page The guy is blind Blind How ridiculous that my carefully set out text with bolds and italics gets deleted by a blind person But Wikipedia gives people that power 

Another administrator repeatedly deleted a link I added to a page I have already added that link to three other pages without difficulty When I asked him to justify it the request was ignored When I reinstated the link I got banned by him Arbitrary I am in the hands of fools in this place 

Wikipedia works on the principle that He who comes early does the hard work but he who comes along later gets to dictate the form of a page What a stupid system Arbitrary wasteful silly
