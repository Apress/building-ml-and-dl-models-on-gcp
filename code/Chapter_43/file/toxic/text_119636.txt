Youre right I do want to complain about you
Not really you in particular but the way Wiki is run  the people who enforce itthe people like you  Its really fucking pathetic that Wikipedia is run this way  If Wikipedia ignores truths and only sources reliable articlesthen it cant be cited at all for being true  If an article basis their opinion off of something unreliable does that make them unreliable as well  What if theyre a reliable source  Or what if that reliable source is reporting on something completely untrue  Doesnt matter apparently does it  Fuck that and fuck the people who uphold this  So in short fuck you    715918946
