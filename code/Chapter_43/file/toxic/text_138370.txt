Im afraid I dont understand what you are asking me  But virtually all of what you quote is simply factually incorrect  There exists no other website where the communitys control is greater  The users of Facebook do not elect the majority of the board  The users of Google dont get to collaboratively work with developers with all software open source and publicly distributed to improve Google  you must now accept a new political economy you have permanent lowercaste status  thats just sheer unmitigated bullshit
