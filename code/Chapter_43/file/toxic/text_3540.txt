It is not disruptive and does not appear to be attentionseeking These remarks are just argumentum ad hominem arguments nothing more You have zero evidence of this supposed motive on my part and are just attacking me because we disagree on the article an unambiguous violation of WPAGF 

Is there a particular article Im working to improve There isnt How do you figure What is your basis for this accusation Have you checked my edit history Theres lots of articles Im constantly working to improve as any look at my editing history shows which flies in the face of this idiotic remark of yours There are entire lists of articles Ive created and worked on seen on my user page including three articles I singlehandedly brought to GA status The Arthur Adams comics article for example has been expanded and improved by me on an ongoing basis for the past three years and is currently undergoing a GA examination process These inane comments by you do nothing other than to reveal you to be an abject child and a pathological liar one who brazenly attacks others who dares disagree with him
