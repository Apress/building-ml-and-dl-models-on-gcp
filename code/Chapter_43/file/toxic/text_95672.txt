Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is But not to worry History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here All the Castros agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents A decadent regime a waste of time for the Cuban people 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this So do not worry History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy 
But you want to know something You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world 

RightHow many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands How many desperate people abandon the  island Because there is no other choice or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia Cleaning up your image 
It amazes me Because this goes to show what you are A megalomaniac too worry about what history will tell about you about what your legacy will be
Do not worry Fidel Castro I will let you know this Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles  
You must be full of envy about Chavez because his got the oil money you never had and because of it he can buy some people But do not be Some people are not for sale Some people will not buy the lies you sell
This is for you all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Ches level yes the same one you made a martyr an icon of the revolution Your first patron saint The same one you sell in tshirts and postcards now and you profit from 
That is because at least Che had principles something you really do not know what it is or even fathom 
heChe probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit

Ask yourself why Che die why Camilo Cienfuegos die and many others close to power in Cuba

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him He just can not stand someone close to powerbecause he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about itobsess with power  anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones Poor guys I am sorry for them 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants But no more Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later Do not worry when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry Cuba will be rebuild All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane You know why that will be Because Cubans will have learn their lesson 

For you all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution How power have corrupted him and his regime How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution how much intolerance how many times he has sell out his principles 
Just to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to
