The facts 
1 This is a blatant lie as proven here Your comment dates from  The last version containing nonreligious reasons for conversion to islam which was active around that time  did not compare zakat to jizya anymore 
2 You have complained with a fellow administrator in order to get me blocked Because already several lies from your side have been proven beyond doubt this does not surprise me at all
3 People that reverted were mainly Irishpunktom and you both known for their proislamic POV and regularly cooperating in edit warring also regarding several other articles such as Apostacy and dhimmi for instance in order to press proislamic POV All this indicates a coordinated campaign in order to press Islamist viewpoints
4 Prove it The fact is I have sources you dont even try to source your POV OR and take resort to weasel wording instead I will force you to source your statement in my next edit 
5 Prove it I added sources for every statement I  inserted while you failed to do so
 I conclude that it is in Wikipedia interest you to withdraw from administratorship
