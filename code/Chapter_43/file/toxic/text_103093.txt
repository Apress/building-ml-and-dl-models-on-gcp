Hate speech is serious Mr Malber  As I recall your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech in that you suggested that people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia  Malber you are a poor person to comment on such an issue  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments yet here you remain continuing with your hate speech  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you  He was banned as you were  You Malber were banned for hate speech  Did you forget this  Perhaps you forgot this  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important  You can disagree with as much of it as you like  Criticism by its very nature is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of  This does not illegitimise it  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism  One such criticism is why a hatemonger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia  Perhaps you are biased in this however  Perhaps youd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review  As far as our evidence has proven you are much worse than the worst on WR  Yet here you remain free to post on Wikipedia  Strange that
