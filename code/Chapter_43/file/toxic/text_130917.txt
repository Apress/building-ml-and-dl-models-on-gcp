For the record this Indian boy is a troll or was trolling for fire BR this reminds me of OH6 flying low deliberately to draw for enemy fire look at his comment and youll see Note that I have a very low tolerance for trolls and vandal so as such I have been the target of such imbeciles from the start of my wikicareer BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secretadmirerstalkerimpostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editors who harass me while imposting as me what Im doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secretadmirerstalkerimpostor to latch on his tail instead Yes I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but Im not stupid Him on the other hand is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secretadmirerstalkerimpostor reacts to him What are we to do then Lastly the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date end of our one month mutual interaction ban to revert my edit so Im fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronicinsensitive jerk especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert Tell me now does it take two hands or one to clap In honour of that interaction ban Ive stayed away from him for one whole month to the letter and the spirit of the law that requires of me but he did so only to the letter and yet at the end of it he has the galls to come pick on my edit Come on how oxymoron can that be that he is indeed trolling by all account And both times he goes to ANI he doesnt have the courtesy to post an ANInotice on my page tell me now if that is not trolling Forgetting twice How convenient for an excuse the nerve of this boy  1185
