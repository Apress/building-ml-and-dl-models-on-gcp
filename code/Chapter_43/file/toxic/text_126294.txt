Oregon Vortex 

 Hello Queen Cake  Your comments to me about the veracity and the worthiness of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude  Have you been there  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a PhD or less who has NEVER been there  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides  That optical illusion that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment  It takes place in the great outdoors  And I have also seen the golf balls and many many other things  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame and theyre going to go for it for all its worth regardless of whether they distort the truth or not  Getting your name out there is whats MOST important  What arrogance  You dont even live in the US let alone Oregon  I have been to the vortex many many times and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that  PHENOMENA  And by the way my name on this joke of a enclyclopedia is Ms Medium  Thats because I AM a Spiritualist Medium and am sensistive to energies both good and bad and I can tell you yours needs a vigorous cleaning  MsMedium
