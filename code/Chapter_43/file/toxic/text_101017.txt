By no means are you being an asshole but I do understand the implications of what youre saying I just dont agree since every measurement is given on first use So Id expect an Australian to understand one of my articles on a premetrification Australian ship just fine Your argument and that of the MOS itself has a great deal more merit when no conversions are given so that people cant grasp the scale of things properly Since my articles can be fully understood by people on both sides of the Imperialmetric scales I view it more as a matter of taste And quite honestly since I have a large number of FA A and GAclass articles under my belt most reviewers seem to agree as no ones ever challenged me on this particular point before
