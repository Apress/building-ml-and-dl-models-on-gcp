Why did you feel the need to revert my SOURCED edit in the I Dream of Jesus article You may think that you have some kind of ownership over the content of this article but you are sadly mistaken I suggest that in the future you keep your hands off of the LEGITIMATE edits to articles which you have also made contributions to If you continue to be an asshole and revert edits without just cause you will be reported to Wikipedia 2416811785
