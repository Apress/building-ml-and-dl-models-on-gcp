Hey Merzul glad you have a sense of humor too  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me  He did not do that  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do  And Final warning suggests a previous warning had been given  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WPSoapbox as an excuse  Oh well what are you gonna do  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDaves talk page he would appreciate the irony here I think  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too   I suspect the batman comment sent him over the top Im Batman  But we have one guy claiming hes a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong another guy who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too who claims hes a doctor and has proven evolution to be false so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting Im batman was just as relevant shhh mums the word my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they canhave proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to ones own authority  But in Nightguys eyes I guess you can claim youre a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy 

To be clear Im seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia  Anyhow heres to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life  1915
