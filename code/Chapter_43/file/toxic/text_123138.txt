I think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage So I will no longer link to the wikipedia Clan Davidson article and will link to the correct history ACCORDING to the Highland manuscript believed to be written by one MacLauchlan bearing the date 1467 and containing an account of the genealogies of Highland clans down to about the year 1450 which was accepted as authoritative by Skene in his Celtic Scotland and believed to embody the common tradition of its time the origin of the Davidsons is attributed to a certain Gilliecattan Mhor chief of Clan Chattan in the time of David I This personage it is stated had two sons Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson Sir Aeneas Macpherson the historian of the clan of that name states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century You suck and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but Im sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view Like I said this page is utter bunk filled with nothing but false information and Im done with it because there are plenty of sites out there that actually have legitimate information Gee it certainly is funny how I keep getting very distant genetic matches to members of Clan Chattan that are NOT related to the Norman Comyn scum Cheers
