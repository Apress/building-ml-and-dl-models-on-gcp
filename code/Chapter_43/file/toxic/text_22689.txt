No  The reason some excellent editors leave is when reasoned and fully explained perfectly valid edits are opposed by pigheaded people with personal motives  as in this case  Your response to my inclusion of both photos has been purely ad hominem  no reasonable explanation given only puerile and boringly repetitive name calling  Curious  I see another white editor has weighed in and supported the inclusion of the photograph of the white woman  What  You gonna call him racist scum too  It seems to me that shrill incivil criticism of an edit based solely on the ethnic identity of the contributor is the only racism here x
