Jimbo Wales and Justin Berry 
It seems the owner of Wikipedia Jimbo Wales has developed a close personal relationship with 19 year old Justin Berry the former underage camwhore and adult porn webmaster recently profiled in a series of New York Times articles by writer Kurt Eichenwald  At Mr Berrys request Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article along with its complete revision history and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for get this pedophile trolling which is apparently Wikipedias description of dissent over its censorship  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page calling any criticism of Mr Berry a personal attack and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream medias spin on the tale

Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr Berry appearing in the article are copyright violations even though Wikipedia is filled with fair use pictures whose copyright is owned by others including screenshots of copyrighted television programs  Mr Berry is a news story  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines and available to anyone to illustrate the article   

Way to go Jimbo youre a rancid agendapushing piece of shit and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turdpile  Perhaps you should rename this endeavor The Oprah Encyclopedia  Fuck you
