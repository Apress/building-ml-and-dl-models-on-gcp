re webquest help links removed
I cant believe how you people run this place WTF is wrong with you There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests  2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most wellused resources for the webquests on the internet and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all and do NOT superced them in any manner ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new and replaces them with his own link and when several site owners try to put their information back up this clown repeatedly deletes it and then you mods back him up WTF is up with that PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests and only one link for help with the new webquest which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefactblogspotcom Oh wait theres one more link too and thats to his mirror site at davinciquestblogspotcom How can you justify your actions The owner of googlefactblogspotcom also posted on the site of one of the links he removed studentrantblogspotcom to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the adimpression revenue it is generating for him AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done nor has anyone offered any The ONLY message were getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone elses links but your own WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN  which happens to be the one link you have left on the page At a bare minimum restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some I still cant believe how unjustly you mods have administered this matter so far
