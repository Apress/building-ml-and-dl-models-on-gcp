Ive got to say Ive read you pacafistic rules seen your idea of logic and have heard tales of your justification and I just have to say

I have this to say on my behavior
Im a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements even when they are against my favor I change subjects help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong ask them for proper information that I might use against them basically anything a scatter brainer would do

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top I treat both equelly and I dont get angry when someone yells in my face

Why should I They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them sound fimiliar I give them their space though I would still do what I diddo to annoy them Except I do it without coming into contact with them as they would do to me which I know wed both appreciate

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesntblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable Others cant resolve the problem only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both see below

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to because I wouldnt because I have no reason to because we shouldnt have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it Conflict is stupid Almost but not quite as stupid as the species that createembrace it Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve

Now I have this to say about the good people of wikipedia
Wow
There sure arent a lot of you I wonder why Youve seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits you think you know what to expect Well you have most of it down But you went wrong at a few turns
1 You blindly follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit theyre full of

2 You think you got human psychology in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane

3 You dont want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POVpoint of views but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right You are NO ONE to interpret what mad kind eccentric ect is Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else wed look and be exactly the same And you dont want that 
And dont you tell me to calm down I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way and it certainly isnt any diffent with Bots 

4 Most importantly you robots are full of shit
You take leadersfavorites who take favorites who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they dont knowwhat else to do Sickening

2a You abuse your power instead of embracing its enlightenment
Dont you get it He wasnt going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself But he didnt He wanted to add insult to injury 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to NO They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embracedin 
We all want what we shouldnt have 
Unfortunately there are some of us who already have what we shouldnt have

5 How you go about it is the wrong way 
Some things people must learn for themselves You have a problem try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let thembutt out and leave them to their bickering Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own accountor reasoning Or they may even just stop BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit things will get much worse

Ill let you know whether you care or not
You came in and took his side of the argument and banned me for 24 hours hoping that would teach me a lesson and make me think twice about wikietiquette But you must already know before I just wanted him to stay off my talk page Now I want to kill him for r
