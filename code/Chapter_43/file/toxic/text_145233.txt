these two jokers are just another example of people who fail to realize the importance of descent They are both notably of British heritage ones Scotish I think and you would be hard to find people from any other ethnic group in the world who would refuse the importance of descent in ethnic identity Calgacus even admits how important descent is though since it passes down many parts of your ethnicity Alun you fool most of us Americans and probably most Canadians do not see themselves as ethnic Canadians or Americans since both have always been multicultural multiethnic and multiracial nations Read what the Epf cracker is saying some of the shit he says is deep The majority of peeps here and in almost every nation in the world recognize family heritage and background as part of who we are including ethnicity so go spread your leftist anarchy somewhere else fool
