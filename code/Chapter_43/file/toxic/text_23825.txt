response to your nasty personal attacks Blockader and Blah
You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda
 Learn to read I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected Have you read Paine and Jefferson You are attacking the wrong men If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and others
 I never said they were anarchists I do say though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him Something that many of them wanted to do anyway
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now I personally would love to overthrow the fascistsocialist state were in right now and get back our freedom But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom
 Blah and Bockade since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me let me find one for you Hmm maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate Or perhaps as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought working in a convenience store rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you Or maybe how about going and fucking yourself Now after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments go running to the admins and report me for PAing you thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are

Apparantly Aaron this article is the way you want it to be just to get some accuracy into your last comment
