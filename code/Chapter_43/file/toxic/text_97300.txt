Why the fuck did you delete my article Battlefield Podcast for no god damn reason Its not the deleting that pisses me off its the fact that you didnt even tell me or give me a reason why it was deleted Everyone who has read that enjoyed it then someone like you comes and deletes it because they dont like podcasts about videogames Too fucking bad

You should get a girlfriend instead of spending your time on Wikipedia deleting perfecly fine articles like that you tightarse loser
