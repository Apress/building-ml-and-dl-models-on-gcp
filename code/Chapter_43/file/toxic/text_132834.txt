Purrum look in the mirror mate because youre full of selfrighteous opinions views hypotheticals allegations accusations hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan And you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia 
Tell us Purrum why dont you also request deletion of every published hateful opinions by Hodson that have appeared in various media articles over the decades for everybody to read Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia If Hodson doesnt want her opinions to be made public information then she should keep her vile mouth shut Therefore I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public
Its obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned deleted sensored and replaced with lies  nothing but lies
