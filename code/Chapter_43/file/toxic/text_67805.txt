HELLO  I am the one who keeps insisting on making the God Damn entry  My entry has become long winded based on your both of yours actually insistance that my entry is nonfactual  I have cited a dictionary entry based solely on your statement that the word damn does not mean to be condemned by God when in fact it does  As an atheist you can rest assured that I am not offended by this phrase  Who the fuck are you to determine that because you cant figure out the definition of a word when it is provided to you that my entry is incorrect  The fact that you retracted or edited my entry 3 times does not make it incorrect  It means that you have been an idiot 3 times  YOU are the one guilty of vandalizing my entry by removing it without a valid reason  The fact that you have relatives that do not like the term God Damn for religious reasons is not relevent to this topic and your argument concerning the entymology is fallacious  Does any ever say Steve Damn or That stupid fuck SMcCandlish Damn  No they do not beacuse to the followers of modern mythology ie Christianity the only thing capable of damning is God hence the phrase God damn is redundant
