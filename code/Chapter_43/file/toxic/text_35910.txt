Please ask this vindictive person who drove me away from editing Wikipedia on question Local consensus by who The very small number of people who actually drove me away from editing this article I have not edited Wikipedia for over a month and ALL my previous edits to the article were supported by reliable sources without violating policy not once I also fixed problems that no one else knew how to fix  Anyway let him enjoy his life behind a computer screen  I will not be sucked into this matter once again Now theyre doing the same to  a good editor I am no longer interested in editing Wikipedia at all
