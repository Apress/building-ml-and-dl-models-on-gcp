Hebrew Name of Lydia 
Appologies to Til Eulenspiegel I thought you were one of the idiots which your user page indicates you actually do well struggling against 
Genesis 10יג  ומצרים ילד אתלודים ואתענמים ואתלהביםואתנפתחיםTAB13 And Mizraim begot Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
You see Ludim are from Mitzraim not to be confused with Lud son of Shem in the far east
Best wishes and keep up the good work81103121144
