When are you going to learn that a definition should only be accurate and correct and has nothing to do with narrowminded You should read your crap out loud and hear how bad it sounds University libraries and journal search tools Are you serious Like Im going to find plenty of people reviewing the latest LP that had a few hundred copies pressed at best when it came out I dont have little distro order forms from the early 90s either Those things usually contain little descriptions of bandsalbums Even if I did you wouldnt take them as legit sources anyway as you would delete anything like that if I edited this topic You dont let anyone skew from the word of Greenwald Whats Greenwald have on other people with websites His crap has an ISBN number to it Big deal You already shot down fourfacom What makes Greenwald better than Andy Radin or Ben Gooks 2002 article httpwwwfuriouscomperfectemohtml Why mention Blush when he gets referenced 3 times and clearly is not someone thats written about emo other than filling out the 80s hardcore scene history by briefly mentioning the Revolution Summer Maybe Ill write a book selfpublish 5 copies make a website to promote it then I can fix this garbage up Of course after all that hard work youd just delete it anyway because you love pushing the agenda of lies here
