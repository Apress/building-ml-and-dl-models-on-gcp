PUT UP OR SHUT UP
To all you people who think the President is doing such a terrible job Why dont you run for president and when you get elected try and do it better Its really easy to play the Monday Morning Quarterback Its one thing to disagree with his foriegn policy it another to criticise him for decisions he made when you dont know what information he had at the time We may not have the best system but at least we have a man who is not afraid of making the tough calls
