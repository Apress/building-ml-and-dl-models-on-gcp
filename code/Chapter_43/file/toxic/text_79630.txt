False precision Thats the dumbest thing Ive ever heard The source for the longest recorded fin whale specifically says it gets to 273 meters or 895 ft The others either only give the length in meters or correctly convert meters to feet I like how you dont even know any of the sources in question Youre just another janitor running his mouth Whoever made this mistake in the first place should go fix it Im not adding that little text you suggested to every damned messed up conversion What the hell is wrong with just giving the actual figures in meters and feet Why do you insist on using these goddamn converters Oh thats right Its convention Sheep Youre just another little automation picking up the crumbs
