1 Just because the HD Radio website is supposedly out of date doesnt automatically mean WSFF broadcasts in HD Radio I actually have an HD Radio and I can tell you that WSFF doesnt broadcast in HD Radio You can even contact them
2WJJSWJJX has dropped their Rhythmic format in 2012 Its evident by their playlist
3 The main difference between Urban Contemporary and Urban Adult contemporary is that Urban AC stations tend to stay away from recent popular hip hoprap songs
4I dont even care about WSNV theyve been going downhill
5 In the case of my recent WVTF edit I got information from the stations damn website

Overall shut the fuck up you giant prick
