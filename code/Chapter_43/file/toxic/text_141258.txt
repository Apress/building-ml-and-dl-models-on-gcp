Why should I pay any attention to anything you say  Besides Verbal you are more responsible for creating this situation than anyone else  Though Verbal was clearly doing as much warring as I was you sided with him and blocked me from the only article I care to edit  You are an administrator who enables the bad behavior of other operators  Wikipedia addicts like Verbal who have no contribution to make except to attack articles they dont like and make trouble for other editors  You are part of the problem  Ive looked at your talk page and your decisions are entirely capricious  and without a doubt biased in favor of the editors that you favor  Wikipedia is a totally fucked up place and its people like you who are keeping it fucked up
