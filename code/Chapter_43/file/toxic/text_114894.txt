That is absolutely false
You posted a civility warning in my talk page
That was the only time that you posted there ever for this issue
My reaction to that was to come here to ask what happened
We discussed it here and when the discussion ended without any result I removed the civility warning from my talk page because I use to archive  remove old conversations in my talk page
Automatically wen you saw I had removed the civility warning you blocked me for a 24 hour period
Your block was absolutely illegitimate for various reasons
The way you did it
The reason you gave to block me was Yes Ive seen the comment on your talk page This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question And few minutes later you posted 24 hour block issued
All this information was posted in your own talk page and talking to another user
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me I did not see that you had blocked me until few days later the block had expired I came to your talk page and saw that you had said that you had blocked me
In addition by not communicating me that I was blocked you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block
The reasons why you did it
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page
You neither told me not to remove that stuff
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude Ignoring what I had done before which was not much since the moment you told me that I kept a civil attitude
I also lost my time coming here to reply you so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request
In all your block was just full of irregularities It was not a normal admin block but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you But it is frankly stupid to think that way because of the reasons Ive explained above
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake that you had used your admin powers despotically you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page where I asked you why had you blocked me this one and this one adding to your unjustified attitude towards me a high grade of arrogance
In addition you are threatening me Read well what I wrote
Hello Why did you block me Since when removing a civility warning from ones talk page is something that deserves a block You did not even communicate my block to my talk page I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin You not only block for no reason but you also ignore peoples requests of justification
Where do you see a lack of respect here Where do you see that I keep an uncivil attitude Honestly you are the one being uncivil if you carry on in the line you are takng you will be blocked again  which line I am takng And why do you threaten me If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing  oh we This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian Go to my user page and see the articles Ive created Isnt that a positive contribution
Look I am not being uncivil it is you the one being disrespectful with me And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil I am fulfilling them And it is rather you who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me but also threatening me with new repressive measures
