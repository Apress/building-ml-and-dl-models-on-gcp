Incredibly Biased Article 

This article is so biased it is frankly laughable  Among the innumberable lies and distortions in the article the part that is particularly amusing is how it goes right from talk about how the United States is doomed to failure to talk about the aftermath of the war ie the drawdown of US troops  It completely fails to mention the US victory in 2007  This article is nothing more than ultraliberal propaganda
