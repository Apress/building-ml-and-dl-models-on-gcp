Gee 5 minutes of reverting redirects cost you precious time I am sooooooo sorry bout that I have been back to the page and aside from revisiting burned bridges i admire the work poured in But it does not excuse the way you treated me And before you go into a hoopla about how i acted i do understand your frustration My outbursts throughout my lifespan here isnt perfect nobodys is But its hard Hodson its hard to be the good guy in situations where they only want to rip your heart out and drain it of your good will Ive been treated like scum trying to be helpful and no matter what im the fuckup So i binned good will and civility and adopted yours and Moni ingenious antagonist view of things Fly in guns blaming and be unapologetic And when did the term for coward change to someone who wishes their name be removed from a statement or quote I know what i wrote I was sorry but now im not Its not in the context i wrote it in Its for Moni to get a laugh out of my person So think what you will of me i just couldnt care less anymore Take my spirit and impale it on a fucking spike if you want that part of me is gone Gotta be an asshole in an assholes world   349 15 January 2012 UTC
