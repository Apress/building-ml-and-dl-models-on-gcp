It doesnt make any difference anyway Spartaz Corrupt rude and dishonest admins do what they want here anyway just look at the sections above But here was the start of our discussion  which despite my polite request quickly devolved into assumptions of bad faith on your part and extraordinary rudeness by you Unless I am mistaken it ended with you requesting I not post on your talkpage Unlike the worms and trolls emerging here on my page I had no problem complying I dont like hanging around creeps I did post once when I saw you closed an AfD as delete when they only comments were in favor of keeping but then I remembered who you were and removed my comment Another editor took your inappropriate action to DRV where it was overturned So again yes you are rude yes you are involved yes you are a bad admin yes you are a consistenet policy violator yes you are a hypocrite who asks an editor to steer clear but has no problem going after that same editor at your first opportunity but nevermind That kind of abusive stupidity and harassment seems to be quite common here
