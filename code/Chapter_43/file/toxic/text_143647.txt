Vandalize 

I would have ignored your message normally and by ignore I mean let you live but why on earth would you call my edit vandalize while it obviously was not I merely added a category that I thought was appropriate with absolutely no intent to vandalize You couldve said it was something you dont agree with or even something that most people who edit here dont agree with You couldve directed your warning at my very real threat Like the next time you threaten someone Call me what you want but Im not a petty vandalizer I usually feel lazy to cross international lines to do just one thing but Im glad to tell you that youve signed your own death warrant and as long as you and the guy who reverted it are in the same country both of you can look forward to a painful death very shortly
