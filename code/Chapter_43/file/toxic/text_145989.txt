PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to  and I really cant see any point editing it any more

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming
Pretending global warming is a scientific issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the scientists

And dont you dare think Im pushing POV  I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus which basically means I have never edited a climate article

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV  BECAUSE I HAVENT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED  I JUST CANT STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening till today I havent once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article Im angry  not because I fcking wanted to put the sceptical view  it is because you bunch of prs have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on

And the great consolation is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source
