Your comments on WPANI 

Tomer while I can understand your frustration with some of Witkacys behaviour your comments on the administrators noticeboard are inappropriate

I would encourage you to rephrase or remove them lest someone inadvertently draw the mistaken conclusion that youre attempting to bait Witkacy into some sort of personal conflict or inadvisable action  Your remarks are stretching the limits of Wikipedias policy on civility and brush the border of our policy on personal attacks talk
