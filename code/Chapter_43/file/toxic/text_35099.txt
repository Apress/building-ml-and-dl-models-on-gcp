I assume good faith on your part UserQuiddity because you have always been a gentleman Accordingly either you are mistaken or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism because the facts as I know them are substantially different from your presentation The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism which is a so called noun  adjetive expression according to Wikipedians The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites My position is simple Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning interpretation usage justification etc I am not responsible for the fact that that Draiusred whatever his difficult to remember name is user deduced that I have insulted him The insult was his own deduction I did not hurl at him any insult And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect  whats that word I dont know and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it  it sounds something like suckpoper  can you help me out on this Also I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Dont be a dick Can you please provide me with the link to it Also it would be helpful if you located that link to that popsucker term It was userNoetica  who suspected a popx to be disguising himself as such And   
Yours truly
