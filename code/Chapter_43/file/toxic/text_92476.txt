Homosexuality and the punishment being equal to adultery 

Are we sure that alQaradawi said that people who commit homosexual acts should be stoned as the Wikipedia article currently asserts It all depends on the Arabic words he used If he said the punishment should be the same as those who commit zinnah then its 100 lashes for those who are unmarried and stoning to death for those who are married Thats not the same as saying ALL homosexuals should be stoned7024311753
