What exactly do you mean by that
sorry but the purpose of the page is to let people discuss the article and this editing style of yours is driving off everybody who was actually doing that
What do you mean by this editing style of yours
Are you suggesting that I have edit anything else but my own text
Or do you mean that I musnt perform any kind of correction on my own texts
Where are your several warnings that you talk about in the other site and who are OBLIGATORY to all admin before bloking a user
To let people discuss of what article what are you talking about this site purpose is not to discuss any article are you completely unsane
Did you read this site entirely at any time
You have absolutely no rights what so ever to shortened the texts of other people It is absolutely none of your business and it isnt part of your job as an admi
I found you vendicativ and partial and you do not have what it take to be an administrator of this site if of any other
So get lost
You too vaguely know about the subject you do not know essential texts made in original languages big minus you dont even have followed the development of the discussions on this site you first came in a week ago you make falsh accusations to a victim of vandalism you deny that fact once presented with evidences of it you reiter your error and banish that person again because of personal dislike and professionnal failure to read and interprete correctly archives contain you consciously wrongly accuse me of having perpetrated editing functions on other people text when it is a mistake from you you are arrogant and insulting and you deny factual proof who incommodate you
GO TO HELL
AND THATS EVEN TOO GOOD FOR A CROOK AND CHARLATAN LIKE YOU
ask georg to join you I am sure the profiles feet
I am done at trying to square a circle or pour a quart into a pint potby trying to explain basical things to you You dont have what it take to get it and it aint going to happen sometime soon
