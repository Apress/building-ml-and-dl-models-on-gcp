Frankly you need to stop messing with things 

Why do you remove so many bands so persistantly

Are you that self righteous

It really is quite pathetic how obsessesive you seem to be over this

And by the way Evans Blue are quite simple NOT Hard Rock and its not heavy metal or alternative metal either its PostGrunge just like so many other bands classed as Alternative Metal

And the bands myspace seems like solid evidence to me yes the band can call themselves what they like its their band and surely they understand it more than anyone else so shouldnt you go by what they say

Are you even a fan of the band Or are you just picky

Mabye you should devote your time to something more worthwhile rather than quite clearly pissing everyone off
