Let the fight go on 

Basically i dont give flying fuck what the majority of people call the british isles im sure the majority of people think you are a ballbag but does that make that so  well maybe in this case Im not going to give up on this issue and i dont care how many times you change the name im going to change it back I see you have already had this debate with a fellow irishman and you were conquered yet you still decided to put british isles back on I dont think so I will not have Padraig Pearse James Connolly Thomas Clarke Bobby Sands Francis Hughes etc etc etc etc etc graves spat on by the like of you because millions have died to for the cause and i will not have it belittled
