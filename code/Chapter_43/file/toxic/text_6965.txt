We did about an hour ago and I suspect you and I would agree about most editing matters The only points where we disagree involve how to treat other people and the usefulness of stirring up shit You seem to think that you can yell at people and have some positive effect in the world by doing it and I know that to be false You once tried to set my hat on straight by talking to me like I was dirt That was neither smart nor useful nor effective I mean unless you think that venting your feelings is a valid use of Wikipedias servers Its not  Thats all though We probably agree about most other things  Ill never open an RFCU on you or anyone else and I have no desire to do so If you think otherwise its because you foolishly believe you know things that you just dont know Youre dishonest and emotionally a child Now leave my talk page
