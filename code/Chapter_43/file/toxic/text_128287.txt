Okay you want trouble We have a problem on 4 accounts

1 You delete information out of disconcern without even TRYING to look for sources yourself

2 Even dumber you personally deliver a provacative message to the person who typed the information

3 You brought up those stupid wikipedia policies as if Im fucking retard that doesnt know the rules Honestly who do you think youre fooling

4 You brought the unpopularunfathomable name Jason Anthony Griffith to my talk page which really pisses me off Its not enough that someone would pull something so stupid as to try to start shit by deleting the info someone types themselves and going to their talk page to gloat about it 

What the hell are you some kind of amature Wikipedia is for people concerned with adding the real facts and nothing but that Not deleting info and not even giving back more or less HALF as much as what you took away
We dont need shit like this
The only reason you absolutely require a source instead of taking the word of the people THEN trying to hide behind wikipedias stupid policies is because you just want the article to look clean Well stand by for news the truth isnt clean and orderly It doesnt have to be The one this is all about doesnt agree with the information that WILL still be up Let Jason Anthony Griffith take it down himself If not the truth STAYS up I dont care what you try and say

And those sources ARE good enough for that paragraph Dont delete try editting An artivle doesnt need all sources to be deemed accurate
