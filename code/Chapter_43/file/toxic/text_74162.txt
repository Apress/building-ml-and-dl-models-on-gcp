Bias  POVs allowed by wikimods 

In a nutshell  I am tired of only one side of things being presented and promoted Those links to forums on the movie page ARE biased to the point that they attack and or delete ANYTHING and ANYONE who says so much as I think this movie could be done better and YOU idiots ALLOW AND ENABLE IT the dumbass supporters of this flick throw childish fits anytime anything they dont aggree with is said spouting off with such classic bullshit lines as SHUTUP YOU HATING CRYBABY

Plain and simple  Live honorably or die by the sword
