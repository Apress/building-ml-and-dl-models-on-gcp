Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 19992004 and therefore is a total dickbag I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show The old ones are great while the new ones Id give an F plus 500 million minuses Id be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes because anyone who does is downright retarded Its like all Nicks staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls

When the stooges at Nick began this show it was nothing but great humor for 5 years Now SpongeBobs crew had lost ANY sight of what good quality is all about The writing is totally fucked up I mean Seriously For Here or To Go Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes Ex Petsitter Pat Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary Thats EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in Gary Takes a Bath but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasnt watched the first three seasons Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 13 because no episodes past that were even remotely decent And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be Im 100 certain that is true ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either braindead or childish Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality but now we just have a bunch of screwedup polesmokers who only want the money And NOTHING else Theyre just like fucking Mr Krabs clones Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE Like I said I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes Everybody that likes Seasons 48 smoke too much crack Anybody whos into the new SpongeBob doesnt know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack All I can say is I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014 Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through If they make a SpongeBob Channel they should only do reruns of the first three seasons because absolutely nothing afterwards was good So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage because it needs to happen soon717487105
