Esselamu aleikum we rahmetullah brother

Do you know what hadith means  Why did u revert my edits when they are not in discrepancy with the etymology i have translated the word the word doesnt mean tradition ok  Theres another word in arabic which means tradition  What business do you have editing islam topics you not being muslim and if you are muslim how can you not know what hadith is so please go edit some athiest posts now if u are muslim go get a hadith book and leanr what it is and quit spreading lies about tradition ok  If you keep spreading this lie may God break your leg thankx are you afraid
