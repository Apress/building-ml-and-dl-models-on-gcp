Idiot 

Thank you for calling me an idiot in your edit summary  Lovely

More importantly
 PROMUSICAE
 You changed formats  One usually doesnt change formats especially in GAs
 You removed a ref that was to the official site and where it was available online are replaced it with a book
 I do relise that when a revert happens a person gets a notice  I was hoping you would spot the obvious error 1 atleast  but alas you bark out idiot
I havent clue why you did this as there was no reason   I just fixed Angel Madonna song    
 First of all try to understand why it was done Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not Guess not Second of all the book reference is the one to be used PROMUSICAE be damned or not Thirdly hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain they post from 2004 onwards And using both the book as well as the  template with the same reference name as spain gives a reference error And One usually doesnt change formats especially in GAs is not a reason for keeping errorneous false templates   ChitChat
