OK I have just put another edit on the article page to clean up other stuff u dont have right plus added some re Charles Sturt in 1838  It didnt save  I wont edit this again or add more  I havent put the linking stuff up yet or even got to a third of it and no one will find it  You cooked your own goose with your immature nonsense so wik can go without
