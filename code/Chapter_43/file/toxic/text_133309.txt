Why did you alter my message And youre calling me an arrogant ignorant ass Look at yourself

I wrote that its A PROGRESS not ITS IS A PROGRESS or what ever you altered it to

And even if its your native language it doesnt necessarily mean that you use it better than nonnative English speakers
I still see errors in your message

At least use I and not i

And again what is the point of unnecessarily adding Cum leave
And youre seriously just trying to argue about it doubting MY own understanding of Hebrew and the circumstances of the title

Again once again Im telling you the reasons In Hebrew Ligmor thats the gerund Gomrot is a feminine present progressive or simple form means either To finish or To cum
Cum is obviously some sort of a slang word but thats what Cum and Gomrot is A word and its meaning Because the show is about sex their intentions for the tile are obvious If you insistingly want that I can put both Finish Leave and Cum Leave to show its double meaning
