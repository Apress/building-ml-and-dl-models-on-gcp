What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is

From the main article about Hugo Chavez

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter but over the course of his presidency Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his leftwing and progressivist views He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castros health

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheists Fidel Castro health This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is
