Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak Its been on par with the other 3 for years Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights

This is the last time Im explaining it so read carefully When JonesJohnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion  Michalczewski Jones  Johnsons belts meant NOTHINGPAPER titles As well as being linear champion Michalczewski  was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBAIBF belts anyways He never lost them in the ring He was stripped under bogus politics Your sources are still SHIT You havent heard of any of the sources I posted because youre a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo  The Ring who have ZERO credibility on this issue

Jones had only won a vacant interim wbc belt champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder

Reread the fucking link

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years A policy you being so dumb dont even understand HBO are a jokewhenever Jones faced his hand picked opponents defending his bogus belts on their broadcasts hbo would even mention the legit champion  Michalczewski
