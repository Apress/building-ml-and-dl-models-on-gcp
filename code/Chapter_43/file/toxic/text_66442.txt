Also I must say that I get banned for small simple edits while several russians edit in and out bullshit for people who dont ignore the obvious or in other words russian propoganda including the backwards mindset that Russia is not at all involved in crimea If anything you should ban other editors for reverting my changes both of whom again I remind you are extremely biased and shouldnt be treated the same way given the circumstances of their background government controlled media and motive to misinterpret news to suit the pro russian view especially that article holy shit
