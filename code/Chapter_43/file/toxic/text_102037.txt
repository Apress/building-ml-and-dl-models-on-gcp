Youre a liar You have been lying all along including today and right here above Gurubrahma please see the following examples of lies from just today and here Ill quote what I wrote to him earlier 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies Its very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright nevermind content but even on just simply whats happening here and heres an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you liars from WikipediaWikiquette_alertsDecember_8 I quote your statement and my reply to it

 QUOTED I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system you would play a more constructive role Thanks   

 QUOTED Why are you lying again here yes lying As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out The dictionary defines a lie as 1 A false statement deliberately presented as being true a falsehood 2 Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression First of all all editors have reached a consensus on the article is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that were having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isnt nevermind others Second heres your other BIG lie you say others have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system Oh really why dont you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system and you should know because you have been around I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals 1 2 3 4 and the HinduArabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with  For a start TalkHistory_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numeralsRFC_2 and you should especially know not just because youhave been around but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it  And again I made the distinction in the clearest possible words when I proposed here as my first point in an suggested outline  TalkHistory_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numeralsSuggested_outline2C_please_consider_and_discuss differentiate a specific numeral script eg Arabic Western Arabic Eastern Devanagari from the numeral system ie IndianArabic which includes many numerals scripts the rest of the article should maintain this it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs eg is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the IndianArabic Numeral system and then again zocky who prefers my version and is against yours made the same disctinction TalkHistory_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numeralsWhat_this_page_is_about The dictionary defines a liar as One that tells lies and a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying csssclll 

 In addition I did not start the POV fork Alternative views on Arabic numerals 

 In addition you are being misleading and also lying about the following I replied to his comment at WikipediaWikiquette_alertsDecember_8 and at 2208 asked him on TalkArabic numerals to respond to my comment at WikipediaWikiquette_alertsDecember_8 At 2209 he said he had already replied on that page I replied at 2210 saying he hasnt At 2338 he posted a reply on WikipediaWikiquette_alertsDecember_8 and then posted a message on TalkArabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly lying at 2210 when I said he hadnt replied Obviously anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on WikipediaWikiquette_alertsDecember_8 at deeptrivia talk  which I later on found and I replied to you at csssclll which you should be aware of because you replied at Thanks deeptrivia talk  but you dont mention this above Why dont you mention it You came to TalkArabic numerals within less than 5 mintutes and you posted at deeptrivia talk  csssclll unless you finally decide to read what others s
