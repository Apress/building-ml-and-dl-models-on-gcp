Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warmings alleged impact on hurricanes

The computer models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us said Emanuel whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear

He told the New York Times There are various interpretations possible The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing Hard to know which to believe yet

In 2005 a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate said Marc Morano a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen James Inhofe ROkla

First 2007 turned out to be the tipping point for global warming fears and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views more and more skeptical scientists speak out and new data debunks manmade climate fears

Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of manmade climate fears
