THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556  Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds

There is a constant undermining of the citys Greek identity ie whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views On the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the nonrecognised internationally illegal selfproclaimed state of the socalled TRNC

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on North Nicosia that is depicting a totally FALSE picture wrt the city The TRNC is illegal not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are nondemocratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour

In the light of all of this I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self Furthermore I do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory
