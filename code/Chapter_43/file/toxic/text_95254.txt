You think the video you gave proves anything You ended up contradicting yourself If theres a song from the Rhodopes called Zajdi zajdi its Karavelov who plagiarized it as Bulka varvi iz gora zelena is awfully similar If Bates said that he was inspired by Bulgarian music thats simply his explanation or possibly a way of avoiding plagiarism accusations What you posted was not Karavelovs original text Look a little further up on this talk page and youll see where I provided an excerpt of Karavelovs poem Whichever way you look at it the song sung by Macedonians Serbs and Bulgarians alike belongs to Sarievski

The word slnce is typical of the Galičnik dialect interestingly Sarievski happens to be from Galičnik Admins Go and tell  himself vandal Is there anything I missed

You know it may be worth while explaining all of this on the talk page in the article At least then we wont have sock puppets like  spamming every Macedonian forum on the net with crap like Zajdi zajdi is Bulgarian I mean just read the comments on the video for fucks sake
