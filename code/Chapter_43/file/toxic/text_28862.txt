Im not a spy  he huffed impatiently  I was just born here

Simon made a clicking sound with his tongue and shook his head  Wouldve been a good idea to mention that before dont you think

Tom couldnt say it wasnt Fact was at the end of the day people who stood by and followed him got screwed because of him being reckless This was the mother of all deja vus

 Im taking the deal  he finally said  You two are going home

 And after that what

 There is no after that Thats it End of story

 What the hell do you mean end of story  Mel protested  Were a freaking team yo I say screw those guys and lets get on the first cargo boat outta here We can do it

She was going to hate him Simon wouldnt be happy either but hed get it  there was a reason he was still alive after all So he shook his head  and turned his back to them and went for the door

 Were done
