There are many things Id like better than to see you gone Id like to see you contributing to Wikipedia in your usual highquality manner and Id like to see you involved in less heat and static Id like to see you not show up in WQA threads that are easily avoidable I certainly recall seeing you choose to say or do things that would obviously and inevitably lead to heat and static and then when shit happened you played dumb about it Youre not na√Øve and you cant fool me into thinking that you are  So yeah Id like to see less of that kind of nonsense Id like to see your good work continue and your unnecessarily provocative bullshit end Thats a pretty reasonable desire isnt it
