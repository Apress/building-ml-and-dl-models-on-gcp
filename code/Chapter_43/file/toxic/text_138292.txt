Vandalization 

The section Engine and means of starting contains the sentence Before starting a Model T deul fucking power with the hand crank you had to retard the spark or you stood a chance of damaging the starter or having the hand crank spin around wildly and break your arm
I think that deul fucking power is extraneous and misspelled I attempted to edit the document but did not find the additional text in the text offered for editing 
I dont know who to proceed in this case and am alerting the community in hopes that the more knowledgeable will fix this
