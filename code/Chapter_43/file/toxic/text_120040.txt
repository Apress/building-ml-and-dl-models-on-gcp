Choose your Loyalties 

Sir

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our firstrate American education facilities you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi

My parents arewere Bangladeshis and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing Indeed during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist I use arewere because I regret to say my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh  and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying I mourn her loss greatly

Never have I felt more love for my country than now when I find myself forced away from it I have now given my loyalty heart and soul to the United States of America The greatest country in the world God bless every inch of it

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world or get the fuck out of my country you filthy ape

Sincerely yours

A proud AMERICAN
