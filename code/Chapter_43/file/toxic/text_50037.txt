Very serious stuff 

Sherlock Holms and his sidekick Watson are out camping on a dark clear
moonless night

In the middle of the night Watson is suddenly and perhaps even indignantly
awakened by the famed detective who says to him Watson look up at the
night sky and tell me what you deduce To which Watson rubbing his eyes
for a moment responds saying Well let me see now There are stars
countless stars in the sky and I can even see the Milky Way galaxy And so
if those stars that I can see clearly with the naked eye are themselves only
a small fraction of the total number of stars then by logical deduction
there may be and likely are countless more that I cannot see Now if only a
small percentage of those stars were to have planets and of those if only
a small portion would to contain solar systems like our own and of all of
THOSE stars even if only a small portion were to contain planets similar to
ours which have the capability to house life and THEN IF of all THOSE
living planets encircling THOSE stars there were some which were able to
house intelligent life then I would be forced to conclude by logical
inference that there may be countless stars around which circle planets
just like ours housing intelligent sentient life forms perhaps not unlike
ourselves even right here and now

Watson listened through this long winded diatribe with patience and then
finally albowed Watson hard and exclaimed

You idiot Watson Somebody stole our tent
