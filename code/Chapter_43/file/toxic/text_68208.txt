I havent been around the page much lately sick of haggling over trivialities but the last time I checked the lead was largely the one written my Mathsci which I had tweaked a bit after the mediation was over  As for my redactions they were surgical carefully removing personal comments without affecting the meaning of the sentence and mostly affected TechnoFaye whose mouth consistently runneth over  I redacted Mathscis comments 3 or 4 times as well as comments from several others  it had no impact on the discussion except to remove inflammatory wording

Occam Arthur is trying to insinuate that Im guilty of some sort of malfeasance without actually coming straight out and accusing me of malfeasance because has no evidence or even a decent reason to believe that Ive done something wrong  Plus he thinks were all too stupid to recognize that hes being uncivil when he does it indirectly like this  If he wants to make an explicit argument against me out of this mess of handwaving let him  As soon as he does Ill take him to ANI and request he be blocked for gross incivility  If he just wants to keep insinuating then hes got a toothless argument that you can safely poopoo in proper Victorian style  Ludwigs2
