Hi  Welcome me to nothing bitch Ive been using Wikipedia for over 3 years  I dont vandalise for fun  I admire wiki and use it as a resource regularly  What I dont like is over zealous faggots who are still in high school and probarbaly have no idea about harmonica playing changing edits I make  Everyone knows John Popper is a legend so if Rhymeless would kindly fuck off the vandalism will stop  Thanks Riff
