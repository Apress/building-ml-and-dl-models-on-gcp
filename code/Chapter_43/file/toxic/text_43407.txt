Grow up and hysterical  Well hysterically laughing right about now  I stated a simple question is calling someone ignorant how to make a point and you are the one off on a tangent  Incensed  No laughing my butt off is more like it  You used the word ignorance which I do find offensive in any form and do take it as calling someone essentially STUPID  In my summation you called her ignorant  You may not think you did but your entire diatribe has been an attempt to make her look and feel ignorant  You just dont see that  Im not the one going around telling people what theyve done wrong in my perception which you did Im not the one going around calling people ignorant hysterical and telling them to grow up  You have done all of that and more  I guess I was right about you all along
