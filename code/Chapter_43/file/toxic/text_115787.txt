YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most contructive thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness sitting there with your face glued to your computer screen uncompensated day after day week after week for YEARS tinkering with the biographies of people you dont even know who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely selfdestructive addiction and illness which has been at the expense of living your own life  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness  Its something of an inside joke and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless  Thats not right either and Id ask them to please stop that and try to help you  Dont laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness Something is very wrong with himher and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem we should pause to help with advice  Please share with himher what we all know  Its only humane to do so 

I will do so now too
