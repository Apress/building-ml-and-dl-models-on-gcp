Mod Problem 

I see that on your user page you list pagesusers blocked articles edited etc etc

Is this just a history of your stalking trolling and abusive bullshit It seems to be that youre a loser who needs to brag that you troll Wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place Most of your stuff is done in secret but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page Guess what A persons personal talk page is not yours for editing as it does NOT need to be factual If it did it would be the users Facts page not the Talk page Its for Talking which you as a troll clearly wouldnt want if that discussion revolved around you abusing your privileges as an admin If the right people saw that they might take away those little jpg badges that you think are real and then your life would be worthless even to you like it is to the rest of the world

Its good to know that you guys are immature CHILDISH irrelevant trolls with absolutely nothing resembling a real life
