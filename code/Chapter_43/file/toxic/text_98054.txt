Unsolicited Advice 

Hi Pigsonthewing

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting vindictiveness childishness and bad faith on your part It seems that youve lost the joy in editing Wikipedia and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others What a small small man you are Grow up Get a life Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something because the way youve been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down Im here to create an encyclopedia You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions Youre making everyone elses life harder Please stop that just go away
