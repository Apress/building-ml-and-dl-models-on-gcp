Kumar Rao the idiot fanatic
While you seem to act like the authority on the history Can you explain why there is not much evidence in terms of ancient literature work in Telugu in Telugu script 

Nannaya  has been considered as Adi Kavi 11th centuryFirst Poet in Telugu 

It is not without a reason Telugu script has been linked to oldKannada script It has been well documented by many scholars and in many books It is also widely accepted by Telugu ppl as well
