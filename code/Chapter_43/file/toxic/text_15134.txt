Dude just listen to yourself  Do you really have nothing better to do than chastise Catholics for not calling ourselves Roman as you think we should  You have too much time on your hands and too little brains in your head  Seriously get it together  Its not my fault if Protestants are generally ignorant about their Catholic brethren
