And how did I create that account I cannot change my ip address since proxies are blocked in wikipedia and Im not so stupid to go in some internet cafes only to edit something that would have been undid soon after Just for you to know I told ALL my friends to edit those pages because I want Wikipedia to be a REAL encyclopedia not just a stupid website with untrue information I dont care anymore though You dont even care about your own website Its full of people who are distorting and deforming the facts and you dont do a damn thing about it Instead you ban users who are trying to correct those facts And what about those other reasons you dont let a page to be created Notability Who cares about notability And Encyclopedias goal should be to provide information about as much thing as possible and as much correct as possible Unfortunately that is not what you are doing You are doing the inverse thing Perhaps you are trying to save bandwith and you dont even bother checking wherever what people write is true or ridiculously false This Wiki thing is becoming ridiculous and stupid if you cant even decide whenever something is true or not The more right people contribute the better The more stupid people contribute the worse The more lazy and unacceptable the administration is the more unacceptable the wiki project becomes
