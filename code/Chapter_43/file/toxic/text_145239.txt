NO ONE CAN APPARENTLY EDIT KRISTIAN DIGBY PAGE  HOW DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE IMPROVED
Stupid administrators at Wikipedia are refusing to allow minor editing of this page  You cant change early life to personal and put the movie information into the career section with subheadings for film and television

You cant give his FULL NAME SCOTT KRISTIAN EDWIN DIGBY even though it appears in corporate filings with Government House and he gave his  middle name Edwin on  To Buy Or Not To Buy s10e22

Youre all a bunch of idiots
