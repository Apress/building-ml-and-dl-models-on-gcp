Nakon you deleted the Serianna page  Unlike 999 of other musical artists who dont follow the wikipedia guidelines Serianna does  THEY HAVE AN ALBUM THAT CHARTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE PAGE I CREATED HAD A CITATION CONFIRMING THIS  Quit wasting peoples time and only delete pages that DONT FOLLOW THE WIKIPEDIA GUIDELINES  If a page meets the guidelines but needs work make it better rather than deleting it all together  Youre a complete waste of a human being
