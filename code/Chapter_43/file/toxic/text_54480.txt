If this guy isnt gay he is one SERIOUSLY GOOD actor 

Ive seen Hayes on Will  Grace and the way he acts sofeminine he must be homosexualNo straight man can act so convincingly gayBut then again Sean acted pretty straight and normal in the movie where he played Jerry LewisMy opinion is still in favour of him being gay though
