Professional Wikipedia bureaucrats like you and the ignorant busybody who reported me are precisely whats wrong with this site today and one of the major reasons why few people around the world have any faith in the accuracy of Wikipedia articles Knowledgeable productive editors like me are persecuted by knownothings who are more expert at taking advantage of WPs byzantine bureaucracy than any particular field of study Congratulations on making this site that much worse
