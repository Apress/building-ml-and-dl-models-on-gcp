banning me for a personal attack 

on my talk page you told me that if i made another personal attack you would ban me what the hell was my first personal attack my god all ive tried to do is defend wikipedias actions and for this im going to get banned

people on TalkDigg are accusing wikipedia of censorship i think there may well be some censorship going on in the Digg article but i think its reasonable giving the circumstances but youre going to ban me anyway to do what prove to naysayers that you because you censor indiscriminately that no censorship is taking place even though it obviously is
