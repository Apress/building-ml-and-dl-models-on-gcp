Disgusting

This guy is a disgusting sex columnist He revels in it He does it on purpose and its what gives him and his column their edge It seperates him from every other sex advice giver Ive ever read  and its his signature attitude tone and approach to the issues But there seems to be no way to adduce this highly pertinent and relevant information without violating the lame loose sloppy illthoughtout NPOV rule Hilariously and disgustingly people tell me providing this information violates article neutrality Any help here by any person of quality integrity and intelligence would be appreciated Preceding unsigned comment added by 2444129156 talk 

Imagine that  a sex columnist who enjoys sex How can we work that into the article   Nik talk 

What Nik Hello I would still like to hear an answer to my question  if anyone out there has any integity and intelligence Is insight and perceptivity BANNED on Wikipedia Must everything be banal and bland Preceding unsigned comment added by 2444129156 talk 

I marvel a bit that even my attempt to DISCUSS this issue gets censored repeatedly by anonymous censors who do nothing on Wikipedia save delete THIS Must even the DISCUSSION of this issue be censored and not allowed to exist Im a longtime reader and fan of Dan Savage but he IS a distinctive columnist with a distinctive style Must even a DISCUSSION of that uniqueness  which goes unmentioned in the article due to phony NPOV considerations  be rigorously censored
