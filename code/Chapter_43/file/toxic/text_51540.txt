Im going to be honest with you Im not going to pass your articles as GA because frankly they suck But that doesnt mean an agreement cant be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA

First thing you need to know is that Good Article status is a crock of shit The criteria for it is a fair model and it is not the problem The problem is that it is not governed by a committee Any bozo like yourself is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article in their mind merits inclusion into CGD Club Green Dot The bar sits firmly in the mud Snakes slither across it My articles on the other hand never have enjoyed the benefits of exception With extreme prejudice they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells which I would like a full explanation for Thats one of the agreements that I have set forth in order for you to avoid failure of your articles by me You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not Tell me something are you on drugs prescription or otherwise If that offends you I apologize but your review made me think of three things Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldnt see through it you had a big D in your ass or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse I must confess Im ashamed that Im even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you because Lord knows thats not the case Its just that Im sittin here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer Even at your age I know you understand where Im coming from

Theres not much of a reward getting an article to GA status aside from that dot A small part of me would like to see the article at GA but it really doesnt concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not Howling Bells is at GA and thats basically good enough for me As far as Halfway Gone goes at this point its outta my hands Youre just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be delisted Consider that your penalty for fuckin around with other peoples hard work

Ok so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells album Ill guide you through it on the review page If you decide to play ball good on ya
You must say the following to me here on my talk page I  am just a punk ass teenager who loves Justin Beiber loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists
The font has to be huge too none of this small crap Also see if you can do it in some kind of color that would be cool

Now I will not pass your articles if you agree to this but I will not fail them Instead I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task I will wash my hands of the articles take them off hold and request that another editor undertake the review If you are unwilling to accept these agreements than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles Let me know what you wanna do kid  meow
