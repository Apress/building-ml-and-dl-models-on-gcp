Propol I will make it simple so a young guy like your self understands any additions to the James Philips bio which dont meet standards of Encyclopedic content I will remove  I will not play the games bandy words or question the motives of other editors or any accusations of them being Bias No I will just just simply remove with out explanation what dont meet standards of  Encyclopedic content since my reasons for my actions are censored  Also I will fully expect any content which contain fanciful speculation unproven allegations and other nonsense I expect the Admin to remove and enforce per your wiki policy so standard is meet on the James Philip bio IF you dont I will
In closing YOUR LEADER  JIMMY had said this I QUOTE
 Real people are involved and they can be hurt by your words We are not tabloid journalism we are an encyclopedia Jimmy Wales
Again quoting JIMMY
  reverting someone who is trying to remove libel about themselves is a horribly stupid thing to doJimmy Wales
Dont be stupid
