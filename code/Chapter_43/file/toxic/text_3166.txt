Its a stupid project

Wikipedia should be a hub of information for all ages If it is filled up with porno articles with inappropriate material both Encyclopedic and for the reading of the general population child or otherwise then it is restricting the audience of Wikipedia surely I mean how can a source of information be free and accessible to all if it is ostensibly linked with explicit material most of which shouldnt be in the Encyclopedia

PS  I know about Wikipedias no censorship issue but sometimes it goes too far
