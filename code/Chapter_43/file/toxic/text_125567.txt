Have you seen the reference to their claim you moron This is not a source Its their POV Once I have more time I will reduce your Pashtun nationalist POVs here on Wiki and give order to my uncles and cousins the execution of Pashtuns in the entire northern Afghanistan down to Gardez Jalalabad Lashkargah Logar Paghman Laghman Kunduz Herat Farah  whereever immigrant descandants of violent Kuchis settled and took nonPashtun lands away and traditional Tajik countries When they have no clue about the percentages they write Pashtu Dari and Uzbaki are spoken by 90 So if they know that immigrant Pashtuns are in majority why dont they give any numbers Why Kunduz province is dominated to 56 by Persianspeakers Go take a visit to Kunduz and see it with your own eyes and listen with your own ears but I can not tell you you will survive that as a Pashtun 8459190210
