The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultranationalism and sings about topics such as the love for ones country family and religion but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media 

UltranationalismUltranationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nationWhile patriotism means that you love your own nationbut you respect othersWhere in his songs does he promote hate to other nationsAnd no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbsbecause it was the time of warAnd only mention songs written by himNot what he is accused of performing

 Hatred toward SDPWhereName sourceHe is right wingthat si widely knownOf course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatiabut hatred Reliable source please

Where does he promote openly UstasheCitation pleaseBecause he wears black clothesAre all rockers UstasheBy thisrock n roll is equal fascismHe is a rock singerof course he wears black clothes
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian noblesthat existed long before Ustashe

Despite this his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH in various degrees to the media on at least twenty occasions His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning or other legal action

AgainI see that this is already discussedFeral is not reliableits a tabloidOnly reliable newspapers should be usedAnd these quotations in Feralwhile they may be truethere are no links to check the meaningbecause they may be taken out of contestand they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contestThis is not reliable
