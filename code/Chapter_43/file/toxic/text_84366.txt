Theres no such thing as pollution on a digital forum dumbass No one in memes or atheism cared about the article being vanity when it was negative It was only until the article became a regular Wikipedia article and not vanity that I heard the howls of protests from a gang of gutless thugs who wouldnt dare raise a finger unless they were cowering behind their computer screens Your campaign is a lame attempt to delete one article The cleaning up of Wikipedia Kind of the cleaning up of Germany I guess youre glad that clean up failed or you would have never been born Take your lame campaigns somewhere else Your mind games are boring
