Yes there should be criticism of Schengen  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries the Schengen Agreement is a disaster  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and reentering the country you were teaching in now you must apply for a work permit which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians  Now because of Schengen Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper poste Schengen visa documentation they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America  No sympathy for their situation no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague no concern whatsoever they were treated like criminals breaking the law  This is the ugly side of Schengen it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe  The good old days are gone replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport  Many English schools in Prague for example are complaining bitterly against Schengen because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers  Further if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen you only get 30 days to visit Europethen you must GET OUT or you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting  So for Europeans Schengen may be nice but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE  I hate Schengen and I hate the EU government in Brussels  What a bunch of fucking assholes They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen Fuck you EU government dickheads we ESL teachers all hate you  You ruined our jobs our profession  FUcking assholes
