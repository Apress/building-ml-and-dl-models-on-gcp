Im keepin your poop in a jar
Till the day you come back so Idont forget just what you are 
Yeah Im keepin your poop in a jar

You thought you took everything but you left somethin behind me 
I scooped it out I bottled it up 
And now its there on the stand by the bed to remind me 
In case I ever forgit  youre just a piece of  poop

Im keeping your poop in a jar till the day you come back 
So I dont forget just what you are 
Yeah Im keepin your poop in a jar

Hey pretty pretty lady

I had a moment of weakness once  so I opened the lid for a smell 
Then it all came back to me baby when the vapor was rubbed I remembered you well
How could I ever forgit  ah but youre a piece of poop

Im keepin your poop in a jar til the day you come back so dont forget just what you are 
Yeah Im keepin your poop in a jar 
Ho everybody sing 
Im keepin your poop in a jar till the day you come back so I dont forget just what you are 
Yeah Im keepin your poop in a jar 
Keepin your a poop in a jar
Keepin your poop in a jar
Keepin your a  poop in a jar
