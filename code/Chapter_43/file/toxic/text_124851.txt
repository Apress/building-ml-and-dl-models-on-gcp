Yeah report me 

Have fun reporting me then I wont need to do it Please be so kind and cite the following diffs to the admins will you  leave the real work to real men not clowns  You think your funny pair of Clowns probably responsible for the Hitler redirect vandalism  Just because you get easily confused by logic  sheer ignorance  stop being such a proud moron BTW Im not currently an administrator   

editconflictRegardless I am listing the diffs of the context because that doesnt give you the right to abuse your authority and no Capital of Macedonia does not redirect here Why would it lie changing the redirect so that your statement would then be true I can show the history with the diffs that you have been needlessly impeding and useless basically provoking and abusing your wrongly given authority So laugh all your want adminship isnt permanent it comes under review and lies count  

 Oh and BTW some people might consider that our dispute over the dablink falls under the scope of this 1RR restriction so we probably ought to be careful about reverting I dont think either of us has broken it though at least not today
