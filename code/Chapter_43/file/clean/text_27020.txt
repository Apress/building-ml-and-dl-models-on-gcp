Thank you for the reminder heres one for you  What is this about being repeatedly toldthis is the first time that someone has brought this issue up with me  The reason that I place a vote in an AfD that I start is because many times folks submit articles for AfD out of process rather than because they actually want the article deleted  I have done this a number of times in the past which is why I like to make the differentiation  Is it really a problem to include Delete as nom  in an AfD   talk contribs friendly
