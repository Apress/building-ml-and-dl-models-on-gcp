I think that the following need to be made clear as the have quite an impact upon how content is presented and also perceived 
 There were three trials over many months Clarity needed 
 The trails were covered by reporting restrictions  that affects what is reported here
 Full details of the trials are not public domain due to the need to protect victims  UK Law Applies 

Big Questions  
 Does the table give undue prominence 
 Who should be included  all accused  only the guilty  only those assessed as guilty of sexual offences  what are the criteria to be used
 Should it list only charges found Guilty or should all charges including not guilty and dismissed be listed 
 The Jury were unable to reach verdicts in all charges and the judge ordered they were to be left lie on file for future retrial should new evidence arise   this needs to be addressed as it is a legal reality and on record

Should the table address sentencing rather than charges This may seem a cop out but I have to point to the rights of Victims to use Wiki and not be abused by overly detailed content which does not add to overall reality Footnotes can direct those who need full details to external sources
