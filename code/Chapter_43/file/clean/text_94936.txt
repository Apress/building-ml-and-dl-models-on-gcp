I wanted to bring to your attention WP3RR If you continue to revert changes on this page you will likely find yourself in violation of the Wikipedia 3 Revert Rule which is intended to encourage discussion and stop edit wars from beginning If you violate 3RR you will likely find yourself blocked from editing Wikipedia The aim of wikipedia is to produce neutral articles about notable people and subjects and as such editors pushing of POVs to try to slant an article is discouraged If you feel that the article is lacking something please discuss in talk rather than reinserting your edits after having been reverted by multiple editors
