Selfpromotion is it then  There is no Jacobite activity after Henry except in culture and the WhigTory conflicts actually on British soil  Tell us which supposed heirs acknowledge such claims or quarter their coats of arms with the UK  Henry was the last to do so and as such the Royal Website  recognizes the last legitimate heirs  Lets get this clear my and other opposition does not necessarily stem from antiStuartproHanover agendas  I think it is debasing to present the legacy of the Stuarts as having been upheld by the House of Savoy and others  Where was their royal visit to Scotland as Georgie Porgie did  Where was their interaction at all with any Jacobites in history except fanboys like yourself who intrude in their lives and annoy them with these fallacious claims  Sure some of those dead people knew the Jacobites and helped them out  Whether I like it or not the Hanoverians rightfully succeeded to the House of Stuart  None of these people YOU support as rightful heirs have had anything to do with the UK whatsoever all this time and yet YOU expect everybody to agree with unsourced claims  Websites can be set up by teenagers  Youve obviously done extensive research into the lives of the actual Jacobites and that is what matters here not theoretical succession  Just think of Michael AbneyHastings 14th Earl of Loudoun  Stop the nonsense
