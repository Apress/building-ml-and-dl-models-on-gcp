Pakoda 

Please do not remove bread as a type of Pakoda  

My wife is from India and yes they do occasionally deepfry bread pieces with Basan flour  Ask ANYBODY from India  They are not as common as say spinach or onion but yes I have had them many times

I cannot understand what would motivate you to remove my post anyway

Thank you
