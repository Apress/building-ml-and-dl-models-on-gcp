Looking for Wikipedians for a User Study

Hello I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota We are conducting research on ways to engage content experts on Wikipedia Previously Wikipedia started the AdoptaUser program to allow new users to get to know seasoned Wikipedia editors We are interested in learning more about how this type of relationship works Based on your editing record on Wikipedia we thought you might be interested in participating If chosen to participate you will be compensated for your time We estimate that most participants will spend an hour over two weeks on your own time and from your own computer on the study  To learn more or to sign up contact KATPA at CS dot UMN dot EDU or
