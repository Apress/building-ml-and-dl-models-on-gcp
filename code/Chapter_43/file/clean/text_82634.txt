Promotional writing and nonfree content 

The tone of this article is not factual and neutral but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lees particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity Cases in point Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit  Rev Dr Lee movingly testified to messages the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear  those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies  In addition criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state

The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lees organisation At the moment there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here

Another important issue is to do with nonfree content Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lees books and text taken straight from press releases have been pasted into the article Its difficult to find all the individual instances because they crop up everywhere and thats a very big problem  contributions talk
