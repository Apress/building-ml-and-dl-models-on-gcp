Entertainment economics 

I noted your recent edits to Nassim Nicholas Taleb My mission is to enter into the historical record individuals who have made significant contributions to the economic study of creative industries Most of them are still living but are at retirement age They unfortunately do not have a fair representation on the Internet although their research is well documented in academic literature which are not freely accessible via the Internet Please take a look at my first bio Arthur De Vany De Vany is a close associate of Taleb and many of his studies of probability and uncertainty are related Thanks   allen
