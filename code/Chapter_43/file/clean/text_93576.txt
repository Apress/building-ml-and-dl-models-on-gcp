Well Guy I was going to ask you why if I have been blocked what your interest was in it and why there was no notice to that effect by the blocking administrator here on my talk page

But then when I come to post that I happen to glance at the jumble of a signature there and see that the Guy who was posting on my talk page was the same as the JzG who appears in my block log

So then the question becomes why the thirdperson passivevoice nonsense  Whats this Right now you have a block of 7 days stuff as if you are informing me of someone elses actions  You blocked me  Just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what I see in the notice is something different from what I see in my block log  I almost mistook you for some wellintentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation  Some helpful innocent bystander with a Help button in his signature for some reason or anther

To say that one cannot raise an issue and claim on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as WPANI that an editors actions have been rude and inconsiderate or even aggressive your word if I had said that is ludicrous  It is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process on Wikipedia or anywhere else Raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of WPCIVIL whether or not in your subjective opinion  you can find some excuse for that actionbut you havent even bothered to try to do that

But you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue I raised at WPANI  Rlevses actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so they are wrong because they are bad for Wikipedia  They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something rather than blocking me out of the blue  The fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue  I even pointed that out there and dont understand how you could have missed that

You are instead assuming bad faith on my part in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there  You have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised just because for whatever reasonand I dont have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me Not a good foundation for any discussion

But then you arent really interested in discussion are you  No more so than Rlevse  No in fact much less sohe didnt block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said He merely didnt say anything anywhere You OTOH have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone elses on the WPANI discussion and the subsequent one on WPAN

The disruption of WQA was done to give an advantage in content disputes to UserGreg L who had already had a WikipediaWikiquette alerts on his own actions at Kilogram filed by UserEnuja in this back on 1 September before I ever got involved in that discussion there  The issues raised then have continued almost unabated or even in a worsening manner with a changing cast of characters other than the constant Greg L involvement and remain largely unresolved
