Dear Sir I do not know what moderators you are talking about but I would likely be one of them and the last time I heard the administrative corps  and particularly myself  had an extremely low tolerance for nationalist revertwarriors Maps are maps The last time I heard they are geographic tools not political ones and it makes zero sense for the article itself to state Armenia is part of Southeast Asia and then for the map to show it as part of Europe If you actually come up with some reliable sources that place Armenia inside Europe I will be thrilled Until then kindly stop revertwarring and trying to bully Dbachmann like you managed to bully others above the alternative is to get pagebanned under WPARBAA2 Thank you
