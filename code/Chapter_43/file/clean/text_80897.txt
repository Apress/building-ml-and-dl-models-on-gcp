 Edit Request 

i would like any administrator to edit these article and fix the issues relating to Mannings gender At some places in the article instead of she  he is written It creates problems for the users and readers As it is a good article i would like any administrator to fix these issues   

As a purely aesthetic issue I noticed the Gender reassignment section sort of buts in between Legal procedings and Reaction to disclosures Id like to request it be moved to the end of the article so it doesnt break the flow of the article
Id also like to request separately that the sections Disclosure of classified material and Reaction to disclosures either be merged with a new subsection Reaction or that the Reaction to disclosures section be moved to after Disclosure of classified material
