Elephanta Island 

I have started expanding this artcile I did it partly today I find that you have also started working on it There is one gazette reference which gives large details of the Elephanta Some of the text would need to be included suitably I have added some part of it in the Geography merged the topology section with it and History sections but more needs to be done It will take a few days to complete this articile if the text from the gazette reference is to be abridged suitably I am glad to see that you have added the cropped version of the plan of the island useful image to unerastand the lie of the main cave images I tried but was not succesful so I reverted it to the original I have also simultaneously started working on the caves Did a bit on Lenyadri and also Junnar
