in response to akaashs original post
I am a current student at fort st and agree completely with what you are saying Ms moxham especially She has gone completely overboard especially with this recent uniform push and is turning our school into a dictatorship I recently went to state music camp and several of the students going asked for extentions on their assignments which according to ms moxham was unacceptable that she was unaware so many fortians were going on the camp and said that so many of us should have the oppertunity was unfair to other schools Shouldnt she have been proud that we all got in 30 of us Then she started going on about how she only knew about the camp one day before we went on it even though she PERSONALLY signed every single one of the forms 
Students and parents are having a very hard time changing any kind of decision made my ms moxham  like this year when she threatened to cancel all or overnight school camps me and a friend went to her and tried to complain directly but she spoke at us for about 2 minutes and then told us to write out what we would do if we were the principal We werent given any chance to voice our concerns even though we had made several appointments which she had continuously reshedualed
