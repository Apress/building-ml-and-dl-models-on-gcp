The American gun culture includes a large number of writers who emphasize opinions rather than pursuing statistics As the internet allows anyone to screen for information sources confirming an existing bias such authors may be well represented by conventional searchengine algorithms I personally enjoyed articles by Elmer Keith and Jack OConnor relating divergent firsthand experiences hunting with light or heavy bullets but I sought out articles by Julian Hatcher to find results of sidebyside scientific method comparisons

I believe sources are available to quantify the features qualifying as top importance articles It may be difficult to find quantification in the popular press including the antigun press but wellresearched sources are worth the effort required to find them

Assessment of importance requires a fundamental understanding of the subject and the amount of time required will vary inversely with the experience of the editor I wouldnt encourage you to undertake this assessment task with an unrealistic impression of the knowledge or time required As a practical matter however you may understand the subject well enough to know the answer after reading the article If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition its probably a top importance article but its probably not top importance if you have doubts I doubt your decisions on that basis will be challenged but it shouldnt be an unreasonable task to find documentation on the few which might be
