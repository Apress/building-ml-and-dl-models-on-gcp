FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas defence lawyer for Ryan recently deceased made it public knowledge that he did not and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated The book was published 35 years after Ryans hanging  only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards But its no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone The book became a toilet item
Its ironic that UserPurrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books which not only contradict each other but have also been exposed to contain lies For unknown reasons UserPurrum deliberately ignores the mega referenced articles published over four decades that acknowledge the facts
