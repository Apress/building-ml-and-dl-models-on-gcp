Placenames in Kosovo

Please before making or discussing changes to the names used in all Kosovorelated topics review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names using English  settlements

In short they ask us to reflect common English usage which will often will be a local name or one of them but not always because those are the forms our intended readership of English speakers would most easily recognize

For a number of historical reasons the English language has adopted the Serbian forms We merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage Wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the Albanian names by the English language

The names will be modified only if the English usage itself changes to something else or if our current naming conventions themselves are amended to reflect local usage instead of English one  Best regards
