Problems 

I took some stuff out 

 he wasnt a lead author for IPCC 90 That appears to be a mangled version of He was the principal author of the Resource Use and Management Subgroup report in the IPCCs First Assessment  Quite what that is I dont know but its different
 the other stuff was a copyvio from the same source

Also Im not convinced that httpwwwworldeconomicsjournalcomContentsAuthorDetailsaspxAID418 is a RS for a biog it looks very much like authorsupplied material
