Tattoos on each others legs 

That bit about he and Chris Simms having each others initials tattooedfirst of all thats trivia Is it really appropriate for Wikipedia Second of all youve got to get a better citation for that A blogger is not a reliable source of information for an encyclopedic article because hes not held to any kind of standard of factual accuracy Hes very likely to have made up the story himself It smells like bull to me As they say if you cant find a reference in a reputable published source then its not important enough to be here anyway Kind of funny but not important Im taking it out If you can find where CBS or ESPN or some other respected organization reported it feel free to put it back in
