One more comment on this I would just recommend doing away with all of these footnotes except for the first one and replacing the battle links with a link to that article for Marathon to Waterloo  This is basically a trivia section and its open to interpretation as I think these are missing the point of the song  Things like the frog chorus highlight the breadth of his classical training versus the shallowness of the martial trivia he possesses they dont need to be impressive in and of themselves
