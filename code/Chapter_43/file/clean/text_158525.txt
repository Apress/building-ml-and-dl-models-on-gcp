From Depleted Uranium in Urine of Soldiers by the WISE Uranium Project

Is DU more hazardous than natural uranium since it contains contaminants such as uranium236 plutonium239 etc

No Depleted uranium used for bullets has been found to contain trace amounts of artificial radionuclides such as uranium236 neptunium237 and plutonium239 The presence of these radionuclides can be explained by contamination from recycling of spent fuel introduced in the manufacturing process for details see Diehl 2002 The radiation dose from exposure to such contaminated DU is only a fraction of a  percent higher than from pure DU  and thus still is lower than from natural uranium for details see Diehl 2001
