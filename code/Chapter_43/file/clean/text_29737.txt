Lets end this foolishness OK 

I have confirmed that the following organizations WILL issue registration papers for Shiloh Shepherds therefor I request that they be added to the list of registries that the Wikipedia has compiled

ACA  American Canine Association httpwwwacavetcom  

APR American Purebred Registry  httpwwwamericanpurebredcom

APRI  American Pet Registry Inc httpwwwaprpetsorgmainindexphp

ARU  Animal Registry Unlimited httpfriendpagescomcgibinpublicpagescovercgipageidanimalregistry

CKC  Continental Kennel Club httpwwwcontinentalkennelclubcom

DRA  Dog Registry of America  httpwwwdogpaperscom

FIC   Federation of International Canines httpwwwficregistryorgmainpagehtml

INPDBA  International Progressive Dog Breeders Alliance httpipdba8kcom

NAPDR  North American Purebred Dog Registry httpwwwnapdrcom

UABR   United All Breed Registry httpwwwunitedregistrycom

UKCI   Universal Kennel Club International httpwwwuniversalkennelcom

WKC  World Kennel Club httpwwwworldkennelclubcom

WWKC  World Wide Kennel Club httpwwwworldwidekennelqpgcom

All I ask is that these be included in your list of registries that are willing to issue papers for these dogs  I think this is only fair  that ALL should be represented

However I do request that you mention that the ISSR Inc formed in 1991 was the original registry started by the Breed Founder

Thankyou
