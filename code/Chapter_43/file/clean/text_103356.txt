Hello Im the owner of the internet connection these were made from We use a wireless router which three users had access to One was a really disruptive and socially deviant roomate He was a friend I had let stay with me but I kicked him out with great protest He spoke often proudly of disturbing all sorts of places  classrooms jobs so forth  and also spent much of his day trolling the internet Hes no longer on the premises so these idiotic and perhaps psychotic ravings and vandalism will cease If an administrator wishes to contact me further please let me know how I apologize for letting such an uncivilized freeloader take advantage of my internet connection let alone my entire abode 2480121187
