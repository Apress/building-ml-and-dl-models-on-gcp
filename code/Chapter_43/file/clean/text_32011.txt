Jdorney really needs to grow up here 

First off Jdorney I keep it up because you are ingnoring facts which I have continually provided proof for I have submitted to you the site sources page numbers and even posted the actual articles in which these facts are stated

Either you dont bother to read them or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them and in some cases you lie altogether How in gods name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me

You basically quote two sources in the PIRA articleCAIN research and Lost Lives CAIN research is a estimated source of information Janes Intelligence the US State Dept and the Council On Foreign Relationsall use official statistics for their information they do not estimate casualties as CAIN does

As for Lost LivesI have the latest edition of that book and if you go through it page by page you come up with the Loyalist casualty figures and British Security Service figures i have put in the article Either you are not really reading the book or your are just lying about the figures because you know they dont support your beliefs

You also misquote other books For instance The Irish War staates that 46 Loyalist Paramilitaries were killed by the IRA between 19861997you state in your article that this is the TOTAL number of Loyalists killed by the IRA that isnt true The IRA killed a further 38 Loyalists between 19741986 but of course you leave that part out I dont know if you are some Loyalist sympathizer or what but the way in which you continually ignore the facts about how many UDA and UVF members were killed by the IRA seems odd to me I have given SEVERAL different sources for this number Books like The Irish War or the latest edition of The IRA A History by Tim Pat Coogan Janes Intelligence the US State dept Patterns Of Global Terrorisim and the Center For Strategic and international studies Why these highly regarded sources arent enough for you I am not sureunless you are trying to push an agenda

All of the above sources agree on the number and breakdown of the British Security service people killed bu the IRA over the 30 year war As a former US Marine with experience in Counterterrorisim issues I pride myself on using the above sources which were the same sources we used in our Force Recon counterterrorisim classes And by the way the IRA was one of the main groups we studied along with groups like Hezbollah Al Qaida and the Tamil tigers These groups are known as the big four to the US Military

If the above sources were good enough for the Marine Corpsthey are good enough for Wikipedia You need to grow up and stop deleting facts just because they dont support your own sad bias views

I will file another complaint with Wikipedia about you and I will continue to edit this article to ensure that it is professional and not the work of some biased little editor who is more interested in pushing his own views then he is in the facts
