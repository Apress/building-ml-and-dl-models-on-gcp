If youre going to keep editing then you really ought to revise the top of your page  We dont need a layer of silly accusations about your integrity or truthfulness driven by the disconnect between your words and your actions    

Good point though Ive not really decided what my intentions Wikipediawise are For the moment Im just checking in occasionally and dealing with subjects on my existing watchlist and dont intend to spend much time here  in any case my personal life is in a state of flux at the moment and I cant really make any longterm plans Ill remove the Retired section though as it is plainly not true This place still seems to have a hold on me
