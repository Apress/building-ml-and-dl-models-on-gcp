I cannot resist Ms Montgomery said Mr Hurtig had indeed spoken to Ms Ny and this was clear from texts sent on September 22 which showed they had discussed a formal interview date and even a possible time Mr Hurtig conceded he had told Ms Ny he could not contact Mr Assange saying he had tried to find him but wasnt sure if he left a message or not  This is the exact opposite of what the above quote and the article have been implying for weeks
