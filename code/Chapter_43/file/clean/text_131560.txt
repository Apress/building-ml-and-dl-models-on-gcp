ITNC 

Could I ask you to keep a lid on your urge to express your opinion at ITNC We all have our opinions and its OK to have a broad discussion about a nominations worthiness but ITNC is not a soapbox Please try to keep your comments ontopic and put your opinion to one side while evaluating an ITN candidate By all means vent your spleen on a blog or something but editors have been sanctioned in the recent past for treating ITNC as a soapbox   Penny for your thoughts   
You could at least provide examples Ill assume youre not referring to any of Lihaass nonsense  Talk 
as opposed to the multiple nonsense you keep rambling on about
