Basic Christian doctrine 

Im requesting the article Basic Christian doctrine because the differences among apostolic doctrines are important Theres a difference between the notion of Christ dying for the sins of the world and Jesus being punished as an example to prevent sins There are also differences among the ideas of being saved by belief in Jesus of being saved by repenting before sinning and of simply being saved by the choice of someone else Also if Jesus had not been crucified what would the doctrines be Salvation by repentance with Gods help Also should the biblical accounts of Jesus death be considered important at all or simply annoying gratuitous violence in an historical record Jesus at the beginning of his ministry preached repentance and prayer and not the atonement Therefore there is room for an article on doctrines
