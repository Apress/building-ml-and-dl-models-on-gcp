I also think its important to recognise that Q22 isnt intended to say why we must on no acccount put your favorite scientific paper in this article  Its only there to explain the kind of thing you would have to demonstrate in order to get a reference to the paper into the article  So if theres some aspect of climate change research that is poorly represented by existing sources in this article and you know a paper that is generally agreed to be representative of that aspect then referring to that individual paper may well be the best thing to do though of course its still true that literature review papers reviews by recognised scientific institutions text books and the like are generally more suitable at this summary level TS
