Hello Jivesh You seem to be quite busy around the encyclopedia these days Who is this fiend of yours Unfortunately I will not be able to copyedit the Halo article first because I have too many WP commitments all pressing for attention at the moment secondly because I am not very competent at these song articles being by your standards quite old not perhaps as old as Malleus or the great Tim riley but still relatively aged  I can remember Elvis being alive There are better editors than me for putting song article to rights have you contacted
