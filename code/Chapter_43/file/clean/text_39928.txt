 Ghmyrtle would you support  Prescott born 31 May 1938 is a Welsh born British politician who served as Deputy Prime Ministerand First Secretary of State of the United Kingdom Its not perfectly worded but atleast it will continue to mention him being Welsh first in the introduction and not just say Wales at the same time as addressing the other problems  
Daicaregos are you sure you would not be prepared to accept the most recent compromise suggested It still clearly mentions welsh before saying he was a British politician I know its not ideal id rather it simply say British you would rather it simply say Welsh but this seems like a reasonable middle ground If we can come to agreement then we dont have to continue going over this and if there is a next time the IP or someone else tries to have Welsh removed from the first sentence ill defend keeping the wording there unless considerable evidence to counter the Welsh article is provided   1241
