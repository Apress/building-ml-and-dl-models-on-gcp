Factual errors in Nelson and Pearson 

The egregious factual errors in Pearsons book on Oxfords wardship and finances are explicated in detail in Christopher Pauls article in The Oxfordian cited in the references for this article  Nelson openly admits he merely followed Pearson concerning Oxfords wardship and finances thus compounding Pearsons errors  There are also a myriad of factual errors on topics other than Oxfords wardship and finances in Nelsons book  And although Nelson does not always openly credit his source even a cursory examination of his book establishes that he largely follows Wards earlier biography of Oxford  In consequence the only accurate source of factual information on Oxfords wardship and finances and a number of other topics is primary source documents and an earlier Wikipedia editor approved my citation of them at the time I edited the article some months ago  These primary source documents themselves along with transcripts of hundreds of other documents mentioning Oxford are readily available in modernspelling transcripts at wwwoxfordshakespearecomdocumentshtml so no user of Wikipedia need go to an archive to determine what the primary source documents actually say  The complete removal in recent weeks of my hours of work in accurately sourcing statements in the Edward de Vere article constituted vandalism as vandalism is defined by Wikipedia  Nina Green
