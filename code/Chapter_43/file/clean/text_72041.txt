I raised this for arbitration by emailing the arbitration list rather than picking a particular arbitrator as I wasnt entirely certain where to go As stated on the discussion page I dont object to the content as it is factually correct but selective in detail Sparxent or NotSparxent has indicated by actions that they have intimate knowledge of the organisation and accused the Sparxent organisation of hiding behind a web of companies see my talk page is making thinly veiled threats to continue to publish additional information should I undo edits designed only to put the business in a negative light I created this article purely because its presence was required to be listed on the PC Power Management article because of a comparison table which I felt was not viable because it meant vendors would be editing with a conflict of interest As of 7th Sept the Sparxent account was created and the edits began Only when called on the fact they were pretending to be Sparxent di a new account NotSparxent get created Whoever is doing this is not coming completely clean on their motivations and this is certainly not being done to assure the quality or accuracy of the article The user account sparxent was created and edits made within 10 minutes indicating this to be a premeditated act and the account name used most probably to make it look like an official edit A little more honesty from this person wouldnt go amiss Id rather not be involved in this situation
