Saju Bhai no matter how hard you try they will never let you cite fair accounts of Zakir Naik The media including Wikipedia is in the hands of people who just wont let us paint a fair picture about our heroes or our people They call our people savages and an unlawful people yet look at them not letting other users speak positively about others in the face of criticism and negative perspectives They call this freedom of speech freedom of expression while barring us from sharing our views Just like how Canada and Britain banned Zakir bhai they do their best to stop our advancements  but they know not the Power of Allah InshAllah even with all this negative media Zakir bhai will come out of this as a hero And as for you Ari89 and SlimVirgin may Allah either give you either hidiyaat or punishment for neglecting your duties as honest editors  InshAllah  Preceding unsigned comment added by 891082487
