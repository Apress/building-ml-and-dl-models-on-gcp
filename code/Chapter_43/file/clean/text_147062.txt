Thank you for contributing to Wikipedia You may be unfamiliar with the copyright rules regarding what you can and cannot add to Wikipedia I noticed for example that the text and picture for Atlanta Civic Center were copied directly from the Civic Centers webpage For most webpages the content on the page is copyrighted so you cant just cut and paste that information into a Wikipedia article What you should do instead is summarize and paraphrase information from other sources As an example Ive replaced the text at Atlanta Civic Center with a very short summary of what was there beforehand  maybe you could add back some relevant information in your own words Ive also listed the picture there to be deleted Please see WikipediaCopyrights for more information

Please dont view this information as a scolding We appriciate your help and realize that it usually takes new users a little bit of time to understand some of the rules Please continue to contribute but be more careful  2006 Jun 6 2005 UTC
