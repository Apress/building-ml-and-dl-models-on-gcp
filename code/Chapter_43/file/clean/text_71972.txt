Time to start final editing
This article now has a wealth of information more than enough to cover the subject I suggest we begin to go through a section at a time and tighten up
Is all sourced with recognized reliable sources A scholarly article in a peer reviewed article may be a more appropriate source than a book review in a church magazine For instance maybe the Lutheran Church parish magazine is not the best place to find scholarly information on Martin Luther Im Lutheran so I can poke at myself for fun
Is the grammar OK
How is POV
Is it covered in other articles and can be removed or moved to the appropriate article
Evaluate the number and usefulness of some of the citations
I share some not all of Blue Ties frustrations about the article Perhaps some fresh editors can read through it for continuity and point out where the article is unclear and where it is too detailed or muddled
Are our sources balanced Have we used too many or too few apologetic works
Have we strayed into Original Research by using so much from the Journal of Discourses Do any of the established reliable sources cover this same material Can we quote from them instead I dont know but think it should be discussed

Blue Ties comments about the background section intro have made me evaluate some of what I wrote I still need to tighten up and give attributions I might say Historians Brooks and Quinn as well as others attribute the Mountain Meadows massacre to a number of factors relating to the conditions in the Utah Territory in 1857 Both are mentioned in the ref sections for curious readers to check out The succeeding subsections should point to the exact citations in those sources

We need to be evaluating and clarifying not expanding Yes this is my opinion and it is never humble The article is not coming together it is becoming unwieldy I came in to help with citations so I have little ownership for the earlier content Perhaps my edits have only added to the confusion I am trying to remain neutral but it is easy to get sucked in Are there tools to use for editing I have been using a sandbox to do major rewrites then moving it over Do we want to take a section at a time somewhere else and cuss and discuss it I have never worked to create a featured article so I look for guidance in the best way to proceed

There are basically three of us now editing and it may be time to step back and let others with a fresh eye work for a while I know I have miles of articles to go before I sleep So I am looking for direction and going to work
