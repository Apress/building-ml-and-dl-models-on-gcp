Except thats not whats going on here at all It should be pretty apparent at this point from the lack of actual help Greg has given to BLPs that he really doesnt care about them It is a convenient issue that he can make noise about Since many Wikipedians are understandably very concerned about BLPs if he claims thats what he really cares about he can sound far more concerned It should be very telling that Greg didnt pick up claiming about BLPs until very late It was never an issue for him until well after he was blocked Hes simply found a convenient thing that he can use to make his behavior seem more acceptable If he really cared hed point out to us the various problems
