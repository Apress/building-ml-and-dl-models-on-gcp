could I ask you to please comment on what did you perceive as repeated violations of WPNPA so as to give me a chance to defend myself Right now I couldnt care less about this block its your notion that it is me whos in the wrong here after it was Wee who acted without consensus and removed a whole section of an article This just isnt fair at all How am I supposed to appeal a block if Im not given the precise reasons for it Ive said it before and Ill say it again any mention made by me of Wee making untrue statements I can 100 back up with evidence I did so at the last ANI and are prepared to do so again with absolutely any edit you wish Regards
