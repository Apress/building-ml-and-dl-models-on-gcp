Are you sure

Are you sure the NABI 40SFW and NFI D60HF are in service for AC Transit

I was told that all the NABI 40SFW retired or unless that was only 1997 models and not 1998 as well and was told that all NFI D60HF are retired but i would  like to see some proof if there in service still or not
