Yes I agree Wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now Vitali has considered fighting Huck after Huck defends his Cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching Chisora He wants to fight Haye but Haye wants to much money to make it happen clearly hes trying to cash out That might be it for his career Since other p4p boxers have more sections I dont see the issue with adding more for Vitali But we can decide that in the future after his next fight For now there is only the Chisora fight Given the slap in the prefight conference spitting in Wladimirs face before the fight and brawling with Haye in the postconference I think this is worthy of a headline Its also one of the most defining fights of Vitalis career as he won it at an old age with only one arm
