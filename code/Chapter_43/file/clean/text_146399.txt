Unprotection of WPSPOILER
Could you please unprotect WPSPOILER You  Protected WikipediaSpoiler Exactly the same stupid edit war that got it protected before unfortunately When you said Exactly the same stupid edit war that got it protected before were you referring to the reason the page got  on December 8 2007 at 2207 by  The protection policy says During edit wars administrators should not protect pages when they are involved as a party to the dispute except in the case of simple vandalism or libel issues against living people I believe you are involved as a party to the dispute having  the  template which led to WPSPOILER being  without prior discussion on the talk page I see no reason why WPSPOILER should be protected for 4 weeks Could you please reconsider your edit Thank you
