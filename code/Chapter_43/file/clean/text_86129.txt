I would say that the process of lumping and splitting is intimately connected to phylogenetics not to cladistics by the fact that reality is ambiguous both in a momentary and in a historical perspective This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization and try to solve with cladistics However cladistics does not solve the problem but only transfers it into concepts erroneously equalizing time with space The problem ie ambiguity is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality This statement is extremely difficult to understand although it is perfectly clear the problem ie ambiguity is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference since a difference is unsolvable This problem that is this fact is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind ie categories of categories It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with yes There is no way to escape this ambiguity Mats Envall presently at 832542053
