I would recommend this page is moved to Maroonbellied Parakeet with this Maroonbellied Conure becomming a redirect page Maroonbellied Parakeet is the name used by all major authorities that I know of notably the South American Classification Committee and therefore also AOU Sibley  Monroe Clements and Howard  Moore It is also the name used in the recently published BIRDS OF THE WORLD Recommended English Names by Gill  Wright Having spend considerable times in the field where it occurs I have yet to hear anyone referring to it as a conure in these regions This term is as far as I know strictly used in aviculture I have seen the argument used that it as well as other members of the genus Pyrrhura are conures but not parakeets and it would therefore be wrong to call them parakeets but this is wrong as both groups as typically defined see conure and parakeet are polyphyletic
