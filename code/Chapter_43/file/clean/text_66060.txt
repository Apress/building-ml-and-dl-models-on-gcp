SimonP the creator of the 100 or so gospel verse articles has tried to claim that the votes for the only notable verses section would include most of the 30000 verses of the bible because he sees them as notable To avoid such a POV twisting of the votes I have added a new section    for voting on whether the number of notable verses is more like 30000 or more like 30 Would you care to vote there as well
