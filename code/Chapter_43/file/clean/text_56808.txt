Re Your edit to the Messianic Judaism template 

Hello Noogster please note that the only edits I have made to the template have been to remove the WikiProject link this was my latest edit so your comments on my talk page are misplaced apart from the WikiProject link which I have discussed previously at Template talkMessianic JudaismExclusive MJ Please do try to discuss the content of the template on the talk page rather than reverting as edit warring doesnt achieve any productive results it is also worse on templates as every time you edit it a change has to be made in every page using the template You are much more likely to get your points across by discussing them with other editors and reaching a consensus Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks
