I removed dispute tag because you cannot put a duspute tag to whole section because of one or two words azerbaijani if you do not like iranica then you can go and put dispute tag to iranica webpage otherwise do not mess up whole section and it is obviously true that atabegs ruled some parts of modern armenia and modern turkey so it cannot be bounded to arran which was not even used that time arran died before seljuqs came to azerbaijan and no matter your some pseudoscholars try to resurrect it
