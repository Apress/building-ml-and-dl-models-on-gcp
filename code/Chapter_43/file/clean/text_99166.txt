Environmentalists who favor nuclear energy 

The Criticism section begins with the introductory statement that some environmentalists favor nuclear energy and criticize opponents  The body of the section lists examples such as James Lovelock Patrick Moore and Stewart Brand  An editor has questioned whether they are really environmentalists  This is a fair question since many people call themselves environmentalists with no apparent qualifications  These three individuals in contrast have spent their lives researching environmental problems and educating the public about them  If the term environmentalist doesnt apply to them then it doesnt apply to anyone
