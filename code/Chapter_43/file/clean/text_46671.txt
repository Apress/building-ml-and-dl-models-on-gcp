The article should be unprotected on 25 October  After the article published on Le Monde newspaper  its been recalled on the French talk page that hiding specific dimensions of a topic is considered WPPOV  The current montage doesnt even show the actual city only a collection of lifeless landmarks closeups For the matter this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio Europe 1  This is why I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower the undisputed symbol of the city but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis Thats the only way in my humble opinion to reach WPNPOV in this case
