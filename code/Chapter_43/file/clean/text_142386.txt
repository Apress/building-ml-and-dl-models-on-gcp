I guess its a valid point that I could look up these words but my point was that in order to make sense of the Latin words into a system that I and most modern readers would be familiar with the article as written essentially requires the reader to learn about a third set of units which are not at all relevant except very tangentially to either the topic of the article or the conventional systems in use today Its almost like having an EnglishLatin dictionary which asks you to see the corresponding entry in a Russian dictionary to properly clarify the meanming of the terms being discussed None of the other weights and measures articles in wikipedia have headwords that are not the actual term used in the original context so it seems to me this is the article that should be changed to match the general pattern
