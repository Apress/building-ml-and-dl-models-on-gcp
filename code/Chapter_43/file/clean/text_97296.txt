That helped a lot thanks The thing is most of the media sources in Indiaoften considered the criteria for WPRS neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated The other day content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length except for announcing the winning coalition  Nothing muchin fact nothing at all is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance At the moment various Youtube channels and smallscale news agenciesthat probably dont even own a website of their own are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that Iam the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia Excluding this personality There are several others more who are making significant popular impact but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out and worse still they are the first to sponsorsupport opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WPRS every time Thousands of other articles meanwhile present heck loads of falsehood and bullsit Iam not using that as an excuse but you know its just surprisingand suspicious the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles As a relative newbie I find Its tough to resist intimidation and not crumble at the same time Thanks for your reply it was very informative and Iam glad I was worth all that talk  contr  mail
