That seems a bit arbitrary  There are no reliable sources given for the current cultural references  The whole point of popcultural references is that such things dont need to be spelled out  It just so happens that the writers of futurama inhabit a more mathematical popculture where Mobius dick is as common as a chicken crossing the road  At any rate I guess fair enough and its not like most futurama fans wouldnt already know anyway and im sure you have better things to do with your time  cheers
