Siege of Dubrovnik and other nonsense 

Take a look at this part 

Đukanovićs cabinet organized the Siege of Dubrovnik

how could possibly the Government of Montenegro organize a JNA operation Even in todays independent Montenegro Government does not command the army president does

Then theres

 most infamous was the handover of 200 Moslem refugees in 1992 directly to the Trebinje corpus at the order of Milo Djukanovic For 23 days the Montenegrin police and Yugoslav special forces under Milos command hunted down the Muslims until each and every one of them was arrested 

Make a search on the deportation of Muslims and the command responsibility

Milo opposed the Dayton Accords which he criticized as being antiSerb

The moment that sparked most controversy in 1999 is when Milo as President openly asked President Clinton to bomb Montenegro

Anyone can find a source for this nonsense

Im tired of quoting for now but this text has remained to be full of speculative and inaccurate informations Will edit heavily soon
