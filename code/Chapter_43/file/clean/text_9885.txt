What proof do you have that Nowruz is Persian holiday You are allowing the false information to be presented to the public There is certainly no evidence of holiday to be of persian iranian or zoroastrian origin I goes back to the Sumerian festival of Akitu httpenwikipediaorgwikiAkitu Persians came to the plato along with other iranian speakers after the ancient civilisations were already established there Aryans certainly changed the name of many geographic locations including the names of holidays I believe any reference to Persian or Iranian must be amended with word Near East or at least Iranian plate as in reference to the geographic location rather specific ethnicity
