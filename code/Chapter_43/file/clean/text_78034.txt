Yeah See what happened is I noticed there was LS Magazine in jawikipedia and not here So I didnt really check if there was anything similar here  only until AFTER I translated the article and tagged it with CP category  and went to browse it that I noticed there was LS Studio with some information already covered in this article  Perhaps a merge of anything thats new in this article into LS Studio and then a redirect would be a good idea timecop
