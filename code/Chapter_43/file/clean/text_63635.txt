The table was at 100 but a FLC reviewer suggested otherwise  If you would post a comment on the FLC page as to making it 100 that would help me get a consensus as to how to set the table  I tried a similar color scheme to what was on the Vikings page but red on dark blue was too hard to read whereas yellow on purple looked great  On the 1995 and 1976 pages I used the colors of the two teams that were on the draftseemywork
