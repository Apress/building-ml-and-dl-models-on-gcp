Hi Do you mean the box that says This article is an orphan as few or no other articles link to it on the article Gobar Times That has been added manually and can only be removed manually by editing the page but you should only do that when you have satisfied the issue it describes If you check the What links here link in the Toolbox section in the column at the left of the article youll see nothing links to it which is what that is about So youd need to find other articles where a link to Gobar Times would be appropriate and add them
