I completly support Frank Bainimarama  

Frank Bainimarama is a brilliamnt man who is all but trying to create distabilty for Fijithe Australian biased media says so and is merely as he saystrying to clean up FijiHe is trying to diminish all corruptuion in Fijian Politics and an important move was to remove Laisenia Qarase who had been involved with George Speight and had only been elected due to the vunrebility of the Fijian people following the 2000 coup in which Mahendra Chaudry was illegally removedunder duressBainmarama is attempting to remake Fiji into a better country a fairer countryAnd if something illegal has to be done to create democracy and fairness of all races in Fijithen so be it
