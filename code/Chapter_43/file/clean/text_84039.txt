Noclador at the top of this article Sunday Adelaja its written This article has multiple issues and there are four points below

Point 1 It seems like the article has enough verification for the information it contains now Verifications has been added and I think information without verification has been removed

Point 2 I think it has become quite neutral It looks like opinions has been removed and now its information based on different verifications

Point 3 I dont think the article is too long its actually not long at all If more verifiable information is found I think this article could become better even if it becomes longer

Point 4 The edits by persons with conflict of interest both for and against seems to be reverted and the information left is more and more factual with verification

Noclador please look over it and see if you can remove that this article has multiple issues or at least some of these points Thank you I will also look for more verifiable information and if I find I will try to enrich this article and Im sure you and others will edit what I add to keep it as neutral as possibleHheejj talk
