First of all congrats on the new bit

In relation to your questions my answer to both would be yes  I think its fine to promote hooks you yourself have reviewed and its always a good idea to take hooks from the expiring noms section if possible

Some people do think its best practice not to promote hooks you have reviewed but in my opinion the first priority is always to get a well balanced update so I think you should always take the most appropriate hooks for your update whether you reviewed them or someone else In fact when I am preparing updates I frequently review and promote hooks on the fly because I cant find a suitable mix in the available reviewed hooks Hope that helps
