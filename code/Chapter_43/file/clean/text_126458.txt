Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of ImageTTU Sealsvg ImageTTUS Sealsvg and ImageTTUHSC Sealsvg with ImageTexas Tech CoApng in their respective articles  The reason I replaced them was twofold

First of all it simply seems to me that at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles not so sure about TTUS the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question according to the visual identity guidelines at  the Official Seal and Signature are  reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the admittedly small chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university and complies with the advice which while we are not bound by it under fair use it would seem courteous for use to follow that the Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University and that documents that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature ie the Coat of Arms  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles not to mention in my opinion at least showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it

The second and more significant reason for the replacement however was that while Id originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith believing them to be acceptable with US fair use law as well as our policies upon further reflection Im not longer as convinced of this as I was  In particular while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3b especially given that theyre freely available from the TTU web site anyway I now feel that regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images and therefore fail the nonfree content criterion 3a

Thus I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia and do not want myself to be associated with them  As their uploader I have the right to delete them the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while in case someone did object to the change and did not want others to end up tagging them and warning me about it while they were there  That said I still dont want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log if you want to despite the issues I outlined above youre free to reupload them or bitmap versions of them under a different title thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and US law  I no longer want that responsibility

Oh and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus Im pretty sure that blatantly violates our nonfree content criterion 8  Its not like that article really needs either of the images anyway
