I agree with Kevin entirely The first paragraph of the section is highly debatable Certainly Jewsslogan is a recent invention Condescending use of the epitaph has been around a lot longer unfortunately In that light the paragraph needs serious revision
Also it would greatly benefit from mentioning last years attempts by the club to reduce if not eradicate the slogans altogether  The club argued it was inappropriate and hurtful to many of the clubs Jewish supporters the statement must be out there on ajaxnl
Regardless of any of the above hardcore Ajax supporters are not exclusively Jewish neither currently nor historically which is definitely worth mentioning in light of the symbols and slogans
