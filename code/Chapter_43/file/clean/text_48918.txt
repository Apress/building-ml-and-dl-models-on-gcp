Photo 

If the photo is to be freely released there is a couple of things you need to do

 Get the office to write to permissionsenwikimediaorg
 Provide that email address with evidence that permission to release text or images under a free license has been received from a third party copyright holder ie Kim Carrs office
 A day or two later a Permissions volunteer will come and mark the image in the appropriate way so it will not be deleted and can be used in our article on him

We certainly have no objections to new images esp if theyre a significant improvement on what we have but they need to be put through the proper process to remove any doubt that Wikipedia is violating copyright by displaying images that someone else holds a copyright on Orderinchaos
