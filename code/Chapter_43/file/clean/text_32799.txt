On 28 May 2011 actressdirector Sondra Locke turned 67 according to Yahoo News   ABC News  the Associated Press  Leigh Valley News  and The Boston Globe  this directly correlates to her being born on 28 May 1944 Her birthdate is 28 May 1944 according to MSN movies  the Internet Movie Database
  and the Notable Names Database
 Many
printed publications erroneously list her birth year as 1947 The
Middle Tennessee State University yearbook from 1963 has a photo of
her  appearing in a production of Arthur Millers play The
Crucible If born in 1947 this would make Locke a 16yearold
university student an unlikely scenario Lockes age is stated as 45 in this 1989 People magazine article  correlating to a 1944 birth year As of August 2011 Locke is 67 years old according to public records 
correlating to her being born in 1944

I dont understand how this could be disputed It is quite obvious that Ms Locke lied about her age when she began her Hollywood career in order to get roles
