Like Sheen said himself on Jimmy Kimmels show all you need in this country to have a voice is be a tax paying American who loves their country If you believe otherwise I suggest you define what makes a true American then hmmm I suppose youre suggesting a true American is somebody who just yes mans whatever hisher leaders In which case if somebody does otherwise are subject to some type of law violation If this is accurate then what youre advocating is tyranny by definition not freedom nor liberty And for everyones information the FBIUS Government hasnt indicted Bin Laden for 911 either due to lack of evidence Thats right people the fat man dressed up like him turned out to be someone else Stop refuting the evidence and wake up
