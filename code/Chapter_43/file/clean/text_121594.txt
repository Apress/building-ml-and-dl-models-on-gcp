Abusive harrassment of blocked editor 

These related edits on Maliks talk page are inappropriate period and right after hes been blocked are a violation of our policy against dancing on another users grave  I reverted them  I could block you its the standard thing to do when people abuse blocked editors like that but I would much prefer you just not edit Maliks talk page again

Thank you   
Admins stick together Never talk back I get it  Lots of shit 
You might notice the TB above inviting me to respond to his shitty message The Dissident Aggressor 

I think you will find the grave dancing is found distasteful around here regardless of who is being mocked Chillum 
In that case Ill revert to the comments I made before I noticed he was blocked The Dissident Aggressor 

You actually reverted to the most insulting version Youre blocked

   
DissidentAggressor yes Im an admin too and Im sticking with Malik not because hes an admin but because hes a great guy and without him this project would be worse off So you were on the wrong side of some debate with himwell it happens Sorry but Malik was correct in his reading of Selected discography Now you said some shit and you caught Malik at a bad moment and the rest of the admin corps and you said some more shit and now youre blocked for gravedancing My advice to you think about the situation in which all this happened find the appropriate way to take back what you shouldnt have said and get back to editing Ive seen you before Id like to have you as an editor more than as a former editor so please take me seriously And next timebut Im sure there wont be a next timeyou fall into a situation like this take a deep breath Ping me here if you have any questions
