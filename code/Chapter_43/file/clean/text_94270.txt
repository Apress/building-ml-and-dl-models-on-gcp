You wrote The article looks nice and the grammar is good The sentences are a little long and I would suggest that some of them be broken up a bit If you are actually in this area some pictures of the interior or pictures of what it used to look like might add to the article As well if you can find historical references to it that might add nicely to the article as well Overall its pretty snazzy I like it  Arcayne 

I added a couple of pictures like you suggested including a few more facts from its history Thanks for the feedback  Â talk
