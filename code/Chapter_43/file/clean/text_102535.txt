Eagle Scouts are expected to set an example for other Scouts and to become the leaders in life that they have demonstrated themselves to be in Scouting As such they are disproportionately represented in the military service academy graduates major professions business and politics

This statement is not at all supported by the citation The citation only mentions statistics about people who were Scouts not specifically those who reached the rank of Eagle Scout Since Scouts are undefined in the source we are left to assume they are claiming that anyone who spent a single day in the Scouts is to be considered a Scout and thus they statistics are biased However this is incidental The main issue is that the stats dont relate to Eagle Scouts at all
So the citation is a prejudiced source and it does not cite a neutral source for the statistics it claims The two sentences about disproportional representation in major professions whatever those are are unsupported and the tone does not seem at all neutral Since it is not supported by the citation or any real world statistics I suggest it be removed completely unless a neutral source can back it up
