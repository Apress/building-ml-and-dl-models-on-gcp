Hi you have made very sensible edits in the past and wonder if you would mind looking at the Abortion page I have gotten into an edit war with JTDIRL and would appreciate your take on it The war is primarily about style  I have tried to make the article less wordy and better organized But I think there is an underlying NPOV issue  not concerning the matter of abortion pro vs con but concerning the role of wikipedia to educate people about ongoing public debates over certain issues or to provide logical arguments meant to provoke peoples thoughts Right now there is an extensive account in the Talk page if you look at the article make sure to find out whose reversion it is  Well I hope you are having a good holiday if you celebrate it
