AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO PUT UP FALSE INFORMATION I WILL CORRECT IT AND TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO SEE THAT OTHER PEOPLE BECOME AWARE OF YOUR DELIBERATE MALICIOUS HOAXING 

2 previous wikipedia hoaxes you worked on have already been
deleted Crystal Cherry crystalcherry and Once Moore
How many more hoaxes are you going to try to get away with
You are giving Mandy increasing grounds for filing a libel
lawsuit against you as you are putting out false info that
could have a financially damaging effect on her career

Its bad enough that you put a link to the teenage pornography
book on your home page and that you put a link to your home page
on Mandys official board that has lots of very young users
