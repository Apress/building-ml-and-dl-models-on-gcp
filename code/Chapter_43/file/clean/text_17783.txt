There are documented errors in that book so I for one would be more likely to consider the newest version which I have access to that incorporates corrections as reliable than the one on Google Books AFAIK there were errata sheets included in the print volume that likely were not scanned  It might be a good idea to verify those entries but I as yet have no idea how to cite an ebook page because I think they arent always onetoone with the printed volume
