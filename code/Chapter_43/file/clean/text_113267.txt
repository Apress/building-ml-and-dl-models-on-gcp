Program notes
This piece was provoked by Mahmoud Ahmadunejads absurd denial of the more then six million Jewish people murdered during the second world war  Upon hearing his ridiculous denials I felt compelled to learn more about genocides around the world  This research opened my eyes to the horror of well over 100 million innocent people exterminated due to hate and ignorance in genocides that took place throughout the modern world in the last hundred years  The people murdered by the Nazis in Europe during the second world war is not about numbers nor imagination but sadly a fraction of the other genocides that took place worldwide in the 20th century such as those in China Japan USSR Cambodia Ethiopia Armenia Turkey Rwanda Iraq Aghanistan Uganda Bangladesh Luberia Sierra Leone Yugoslavia Vietnam Guatemala Chad Taiwan Haiti Spain Cuba Syria Iran Chile and Argentina to name a few
