Fresh Start 
Alright Neil Lets try from the beginning again hopefully with a better result this time
The GenseiryÅ« Karatedo International Federation article is clearly being vandalized by Mario Roering as he removes links and references from the article with false reasoning Example here  The link clearly shows that the book exist and who the author is Here Mario Roering removes yet another reference even though the reference clearly states that this is the first book ever  Here Mario Roering ads a link to a Taido site with an essay on the history of TAIDO not Genseiryu  thus irrelevant on the issue of Genseiryu This reference has some correct dates some correct information but is at best only a collection of information found on the Internet from various other sources and is as well full of equally incorrect information Mario Roering does not cite any phrase of the essay and he does not provide any reasons for why this reference should be better than the one already included Thus this is not a researched essay or document Also Taido is siding with the WGKF and supporting them as can be seen on many pictures and even the agreement of the establishment of the WGKF At best this reference is a none supported none factual and partial essay And like it says it is an essay on Taido not Genseiryu As a third party reference this is not valid Many of the things Mario Roering has disputed in the great many earlier edits is among others that Kunihiko Tosa president of the GKIF was not the first student of the founder Seiken Shukumine but in this essay it says that he started taking lessons from the founder in 1952 one year prior to the establishment of Genseiryu in 1953 The essays mentions that Kunihiko Tosa published A some book on Genseiryu which is I guess the reason for Mario Roering to include this source Using this argument as a counterargument to my source and claim is the same as leaving it up to me to proof a negative That Kunihiko Tosa wrote and published a book on Genseiryu in 1984 is confirmed in the essay as well as other sources included by me but it does not say that the book is the first ever on Genseiryu As I mentioned above this is like saying that when something is not mentioned it is not so which of course cannot be laid down as fact or support for removing my claim as this book being the first ever on Genseiryu Another point is that if Mario Roering wants to include this essay as a valid reference he must accept all the postulates in the essay also the ones that he has disputed many times before But well I guess that will not happen Thus this reference should be discarded as it is not trustworthy as a reference but merely a collection of information found on the Internet The author is not named could not find it anyway and the sources used in this essay are not listed Here  Mario Roering deletes a valuable link to a reference part of Kunihiko Tosas book written in 1984 In this book the founder of Genseiryu Seiken Shukumine wrote a preface and he coauthored the book as a technical advisor as well as he himself recognized this book as being Genseiryu The reference is thus a valid one but it is my opinion that Mario Roering wants this left out simply because this contradicts his own views and his perception of what is the true Genseiryu In Mario Roerings world he would feel a lot better if this book and the preface by the founder would simply go away like go back in a time machine and make sure it was never published Mario Roering has claimed on more than one occasion that we the GKIF are not doing Genseiryu but only that the WGKF is This book clearly shows that the founder approved and supported Kunihiko Tosa as Genseiryu Thus the contradictions clearly stands out It is obvious that Mario Roering wants it left out simply because it shows that his claims are untrue and impossible to proof and that it is thus easier to simply get this claim removed Here  Mario Roering wants to provoke me by asking for citation It is obvious that this information originates from an interview I had with the author Kunihiko Tosa The information has been put there t
