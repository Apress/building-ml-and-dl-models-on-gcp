First of all blocking me like that was not right You should take into consideration of what I have to say If I believe this guy has racist intentions in what hes doing am I not allowed to point that out Do you Neil know anything about TurkishAssyrian relations Did you know that theyve committed genocide on our people Assyrian Genocide and that they continue to deny it to this day Theres a good reason why he want those Assyrian political user boxes deleted its because he sees it as a threat to his country Please understand what Im saying is not personal attacks I believe he has a something against Assyrians and Kurds because hes Turkish The fact that hes trying to limit our right to freely express ourselves politically and delete our political standpoints is not something that should be taken lightly Im not the one out of line here Talk 2234 13 Jun 2007 UTC
