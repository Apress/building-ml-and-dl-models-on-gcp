At any rate Im going to stand by the position that all unsourced edits can be removed is not the same thing as  All unsourced edits should be removed  Unsourced edits that look very fishy should be reverted  Unsourced statements that look potentially fishy should be given a fact tag and then eventually deleted if no one provides a source  Unsourced statements that one thinks are true should be met by just adding the unreferenced tag at the end of the article
