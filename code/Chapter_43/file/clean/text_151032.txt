Organisation

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification I think the section could be considerably reduced  particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an intext link to the various articles on the regional tournaments By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere

Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer

I wont make any changes to the article unless other contributors think these ideas would improve it Id value your comments
