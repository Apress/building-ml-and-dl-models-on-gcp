Actually I know a great number of scientists will tell you it is not science at all but rather religion or superstition Pseudoscience covers some things but this isnt really even pseudoscience but an attempt to pretend there is some scientific basis for creationism They blatently ignore everything contrary to their theory and distort evidence in hopes of pretending there is some support for it The only reason it is even called science is because they want to put it in classrooms which is something US courts have ruled against repeatedly on the grounds that it is not science at all  1919 21 Apr 2005 UTC
