COI concerns
Simply put after relentless questioning including repeating same question over and over again to the point of harassment I decided to try to figure out your POV through your list of contributions If Id seen your edits were all very proIsrael Id have one viewpoint If I saw they were all antiIrish Id have another But when I went to your contributions page low and behold most of your articles are related to SM including involving women Just looking at a few pages its not like your POV is these are disgusting 

So I have to wonder if you are financially benefiting yourself by engaging in a little written free sadism against a female something which youd have to pay quite a bit of money per hour for even if you just did it online with someone who specializes in that kind of sex work So Ive brought it up here per WPCOI policy
