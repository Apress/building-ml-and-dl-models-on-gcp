Frankly I didnt think the USSR activity during that period deserved a mention because during the period between August 1939 MolotovRibbentrop pact and June 1941 Barbarossa it was not a major player How do you propose to fix it Frankly the situation is very complex because from 1 Sept 1939 to 22 June 1941 the USSR
 Won a border war against Japan
 Expanded its territory at the expense of some Central European states
 Conducted a war against Finland
 Negotiated about further division of the spheres of influence with Germany
 Remained formally neutral
How all of that can be described in few words Probably  apart from formally neutral USSR which also expanded its territory at the expense of some of its neighbours
From one hand if you think it would be not too wordy for the lede we can add that From the other hand I am not sure it would be absolutely correct in a situation when conquest of Norway Danmark Greece or Yugoslavia is left beyond the scope totally
