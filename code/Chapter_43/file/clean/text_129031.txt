I do not have any research sources for this at hand but believe me when Im talking about widespread allegations I do not mean some Internet forums I thought you knew me better than this I could easily provide Internet references from some nationalistic sites but I dont think this is what we need I also do not suggest that these allegations were truthful In fact I find them shameful for Poles who always tried to find the guilt elsewhere as the allegations of German involvement in Jedwabne massacre Therefore I suggest that the fact tag stays until the source is provided talk
