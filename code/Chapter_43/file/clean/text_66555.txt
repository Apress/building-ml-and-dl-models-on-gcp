 Blatant Racist editing 

Hi Mentifisto

You kindly acted on a report just now of vandalism on Sol Campbell diff by  User talk8615318851 I thought such blatant racist editing would receive an immediate block as per 
WikipediaNo personal attacks rather than just a 1st level warning Please can you advise how I should act in future many thanks  
Well in that case the edit had been made some time prior and the latest was not clear vandalism so the IP may have possibly be reassigned but generally I think its best to give them a  warning so as to prepare them  fisto 
Hi Mentifisto Thanks for your feedback and I am truely sorry to trouble you again but I am left even more confused and need to know where to refer to to get an understanding of the line is drawn on racism on Wikipedia The IP used the term stupid nr in caps at 2038 on 16th May This to me is just as bad as it gets I reported this to WPAIV at 2119 and you applied the warning at 2120 I can only assume you looked at the later edit to Didier Zokora which was not obviously that offensive to me at least Thanks   
I am also a little confused I agree that there is a fine line in dealing with personal attacks I simply would like this line pointed out so that we will know how to deal with it in the future Thanks   
Well I think its down to individual discretion blocks are preventive so if the IP is unlikely to commit another similar edit in the next ten minutes or so itd be somewhat redundant Personally Id give them the above immediate final warning so they know the consequences of their actions  User talkMentifisto
