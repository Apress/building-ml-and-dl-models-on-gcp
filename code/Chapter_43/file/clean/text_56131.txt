Query about a speedydeletion decline 
Hi Steve I wonder if you can clarify your reasons for the deletion of the page Chirag Kulkarni In the summary you mentioned that the this has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article appears to be about a person or group of people but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant The article from start to finish mentions the importance of Chirag Kulkarni as a young entrepreneur and how he is mentioned by dpru the leading business magazine of Russia as one of the most successful entrepreneurs httpwwwdprua20140618Millioni_na_raketkahThe first time the article was made it was deleted because of a lack of citations but I feel the citations are relevant and the relevance is indicated Personally I do feel this article is worthy of not following in section A7 Hopefully we can edit this accordingly
