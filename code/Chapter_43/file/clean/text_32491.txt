This info is all messed up  

Pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed pit bull including the American Pit Bull Terrier American Staffordshire Terrier the Staffordshire Bull Terrier the Bull Terrier the Perro de Presa Canario Cane Corso and Argentine DogosThese breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation see below but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is 1 All of these breeds as well as many others including Great Danes Newfoundlands and Rottweilers are members of the Molosser family of dog breeds

1 Pitbull is NOT a slang  its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years
Those that use it for dogs other then Pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them
often used by journalists and people without any background info
Its a pure breed dog  registered under UKC since 1898 its beeing registered under American pitbull Terrier under a few more registrys such as ADBA  BFKC in USA

I dont know why this site that is set to be some kind of kowledge base allows itself to have this info at the top of the page
All it does is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed

If this is the first thing a visitor reads  then it often sticks to hisher mind as truth and he leaves the site
If a reader comes in here to search facts because heher is unsure about what a Pitbull is because of medias coverage then this info just confirmes to himher that there is no such thing as a real Pitbull with is as far from the truth you may come
There are so many myths and hearsays around this breed  so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain FACTS

Many countries have their own Kennelclubs  and they are all tied together by FCI as an international organ
But FCI only works with 1 kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club  other countries follow FCI regulations and do the same
This is why FCI dossent recognize the Pitbull as a pure breed
They work with AKC American Kennel Club that dossent keep register of the Pitbull  But the American Staffordshire Terrier
Pitbulls as i said erlier  was first registered with UKC United Kennel Club and because only one club per country is allowed in FIC regulations the Pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality

This is the same in several countries
The national kennelclubs is tied to follow FCI regulations if they are members  and thats why Sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub SKK

Why did i say all this then 
Well  it goes back to what i wrote erlier
If a person think that Pitbull just is a slang and not a pure breed as written at top of Wikipedia site about pitbulls  and lives in Sweden for example  then this sites info add more to the myths

So if a moderator reads this  please think hard about what signals the top text about Pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers
