Removing talk page comments 

Hi again Aperisic this is just to let you know that in general you cant remove a discussion from a talk page if it also includes comments by other editors as in TalkAlmost integer It had only comments by you and me and I dont mind in this particular case so you can leave it as it is Thanks
