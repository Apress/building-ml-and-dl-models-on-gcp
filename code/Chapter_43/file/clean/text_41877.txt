Im not so much objecting to the last of negative reviews but the general composition In the example above the section on Growth features a rumor wordofmouth from an interview published in a trade magazine about working conditions and a reference no a notnecessarily notable award I can find few references to that award that arent from the publication in question or in press releases by winners of said award neither of which are directly related to growth of the company I didnt want to go through and delete stuff willynilly without feedback but it seems a bit on the promotional side as it is written now  TALKPAGE
