Hi RobIm certainly very willing to begin a further appeal on your behalf  I dont know whether it would succeed  I used to understand Wikipedias notability criteria which used to be a simple and objective test  The rules have changed in some way that I find mysterious and confusing and things that would have been acceptable a few years ago are sometimes getting deleted now  But if you do want to go ahead with no guarantee of success then Ill happily follow the process just drop me another note to say so  All the best TC
