Could you please explain 

Could you please explain why you redirected Military Commission to Military Justice

Were you unaware that one of the huge controversies over the USAs use of military commissions to try the Guantanamo captives was that they were a new distinct system separate from its traditional military justice system  The Military Commission system had no established rules of evidence no established precedents  This is why rather than being the speedy system that was promised these cases have dragged on for almost a decade  

Legal critics predicted these problems back when Bush tried to create the new Military Commission system  They pointed out that the USA already had two perfectly adequate justice systems its civilian justice system and its military justice system  The military commission system they pointed out was a brand new third justice system

One of David Hickss lawyers described with disgust why he wasnt available to give Hicks his advice when Hickss was presented with a plea bargain deal on the eve of his commission  Hickss lawyer who had flown all the way to Guantanamo from Australia described being told he could not participate any further in Hickss defense unless he signed a draconian document that would have imposed heavy punishment upon him if he broke any of the commissions rules and procedures  Fine he says please let me read those rules  He then described his shock and outrage when he was told that he couldnt be given a copy of the commissions rules and procedures because they hadnt been written yet

Did you make this redirect on your own sole judgment or was it made after discussion with others

Frankly I think this redirection was a bad idea very misleading
