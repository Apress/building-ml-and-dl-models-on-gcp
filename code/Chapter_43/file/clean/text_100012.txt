Has it failed WPRS I thought that is what we were meant to be discussing And when did majority rule replace consensus That discussion has only just started I find your aggressive actions in this episode disturbing It would be nice if you would let things run their course without hyperbole doublespeak contradictions and threats In fact it would be nice if you didnt keep typing things but never addressing any of my questions so please dont reply here unless absolutely necessary Thanks
