No problems then and candor I have in spades People around here from Jimbo on down definitely know when I have a peeve though these days seems like most I knew well have quit Loosing people like CBD Mel Etitis and David Kernow I really have to chalk up to the endless strife and hostility of these episodic outbreaks of someone creating a dislocating change Deletions of something just created qualify for that if youll allow the personal reference I dont hold grudges as many can tell you so Im taking you at your candorous word too

 Admittedly the sweetness and light bit gets cloying all the time so putting some mustard on things is actually compensation for the the otherwise thankless efforts now and again I know thats bent but selfhonesty let that out so may as well admit it Shaking preconceptions in those that forget WPIAR is perhaps the best legacy I sometimes think I can give around here particularly the young folks dont have enough life experience to know when to live and let live and so ignore a rule or guideline 

This silly series Im working is a case in point Ill served by it when I checked our coverage when I stumbled across it in November Im compulsed as I have been in many areas here to try improving it mainly by adding to it for it was cut by a harsh illjudged ruthless person The original writers went on to other tasks in lifes stages so a nicely put together set of articles covering the series got run over by the mac truck of one guy aided passively by 23 others pushing the new notability rules so they wiped out hundreds of manhours of work in some nifty and salvageable articles Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry inuniverse list article that had almost zero value leaving things well enough alone would have been far better Kidz Sigh

So take care again And mind Franks 24 hour guideline Cheers  nkB
