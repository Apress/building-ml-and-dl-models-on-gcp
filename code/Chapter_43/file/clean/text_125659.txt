And was before was under Prussian control from the beginning of state formation in this area is not it 
This intolerance and disregard for any other citizenship or affiliation is shown over and over at wikipedia by many Polish people
There is mentioned in the article Prussia later Germany thus he was a German citizen  I think you do not tolerate the thing the nationality is before that
The Polish law on Citizenship seems to supports something like this attitude While dual citizenship is tolerated no other citizenship than Polish is recognized
You mean on territory of Poland Yes I believe it is if you are Polish citizen and you enter Polish territory you can not disregard the any the duties as such You can not be both at the same time on territory of Poland and claim different treatment and rights Simple you can not switch with rights and duets as it is convenient at a moment I think this is reasonable solution
Poland only recognizes a dual citizenship person as being only Polish
It is not so simple but something like I explained above
Johann Dzierzon was not born in Poland His father grandfather etc were not born in Poland They were all born in Lowkowitz Silesia Prussia Germany
You know my perception is that in history Germans changed their minds When was convenient the people were Germans citizens subjects on other time when convenient there were some individuals were set as alien element because their origin This imperial politic injustice
The person Johann Dzierzon on Wikipedia is now Jan Dzierżon completely overloaded with Polishlanguage sources 
And it should be as Jan Dzierżon is Polish name and he recognized himself as Polish Also his closest relatives in at least two next generation continued this way 
Many of those are already in the bottom references so now we have the same Polish sources plastered onto Dzierzon double or triple times
Sorry You can dislike it but Further reading is chosen set of most informative publications That is other purpose 
Seems like complete overkill and against Wikipedia policy
I do not know what you mean
No wonder Encyclopedia Britannica reflects this kind of overload 
There is also on some newest French encyclopaedias on line I am sorry you are disappointed It sometimes hapend that our own point of view is not the common one
Best regards
