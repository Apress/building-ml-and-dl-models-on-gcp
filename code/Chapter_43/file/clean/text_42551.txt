He keeps inflating Soviet casualties 400k lost in one particular battle despite the source quoted providing a very detailed breakdown of losses which were not 400000 but 112k killed and 300k wounded

huh this are my orignal words The battle in the Orelsweep which is the German name for this battle was the bloodiest of the three major operations during the Battle of Kursk German losses were 86064 men145 the Red Army lost 429890 men this is exactly the same  for german the losses without breakdown and for russians the same now the real story dapi marked the russian casualties with dubios than he checked his sources and found out that this numbers are exact krivosheev then he splited the number in wounded and killed to tarnish that he simply did a mistake with marking this number as dubios u must note that the german numbers is still simply 8600 men 

Well this one He quotes two selected words and the rest completely out of context in effect ignoring that Glantz writes the Mius operations were successful and achieving their objective of diverting German mobile forces from Kharkov 

dapi provided a source by glantz claiming the russian units diverted german units this is not disputed by me but i added that the divertion operation himself was a disaster where is the problem  the first sentence explained that the operation was succesful and i added that militaryoperation himself was unsuccesful dapi wanted only the good of the operation  but i admit the version now is better

He also claimed that this information was on p 230 of Glantz it was not

lol thats called failurer and i admited already to hohum funny is that while u provided faked sources for prokhorovka i see no excuse of u nothing u dont respond u did a failure but u dont comment i comment everything if people ask me 

again i can provide sources and everything to support my opinion i would appreciate if dapi does the same and we discuss here who was wrong
