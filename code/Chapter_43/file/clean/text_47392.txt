What to do with the Timeline 

Im almost done rewriting this wiki Among other things I added a detailed Timeline at the end but Im not sure where this timeline fits best Should it come at the beginning Is it right where it should be Should it be moved to its own wiki Timeline of the Battle of Shanhai Pass Any suggestions Thanks
