Dear  Ward Churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of TV cameras last night February 22 2005 that he is NOT in fact an Indian  He has been lying about his heritage for many many years and people like me who live and work in Indian Country everyday have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage  I repeat  Ward Churchill during his speech at the University of Hawaii admitted that he is NOT an Indian  The comment word for word was published in the Honolulu StarBulletin Vol 10 Issue 54Wednesday February 23 2005 Churchill attacks essays critics by Craig Gima  Im going to attempt to be gracious but I have to say that you and  missed the boat on this one  Im not going to do it tonight because I do need sleep but there is going to be huge rewrite of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now  These allegations of fabrications have been provable facts of fabrications  It calls into questions so many other things about the guy  What other things is he out and out lying about  But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely rewritten  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchills fake Indian heritage was a cheap shot  We have been hearing that from nonIndians for many many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters  That is a damn lie too  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes  That is a damned lie  There is going to be rewrite and Jodi Raves comments are going back in and all the rest  Your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by Churchill himself 0404 24 Feb 2005 UTC
