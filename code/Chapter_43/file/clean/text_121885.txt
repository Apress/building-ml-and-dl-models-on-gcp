Oh and my dad died of mesothelioma in 1987 5 months after his diagnosis  He was not a smoker and worked only 6 weeks cutting asbestos shingles in 1941 before he went overseas in WWII  He was also a conservative geologist who once said environmentalists would be the death of business   Sadly it seemed that business was the death of him
