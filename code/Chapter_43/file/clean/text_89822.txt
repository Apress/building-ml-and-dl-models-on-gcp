Removing Dyer references 

I propose removing from the references section the books written by Dyer I have not read Dyers books but from what Node_ue says it seems to me that hes just a crank He appears to have no clue in linguistics

I dont think a sane linguist would take two random people put them to translate a text from Yiddish compare the resulting texts and get to the conclusion yep we have two different languages

Also he uses madeup expressions such as sovetul sic de deputaţi or cuvinte slujitoare to prove his points which is akin to data fabrication in regular science 

Bogdan Dyer did not come to the conclusion that Moldovan and Romanian are truly separate languages
With regards to the parallel translation he says the greatest difference between these two texts are in the vocabularies and in the styles they employ There is a more flowering prose in the Moldovan text to reiterate the difference here is one of style not one of substance

 Actually le style est lhomme même as Buffon once said Dyer starts from the premise that the style in each country is homogenous it is not there are much more differences between different individuals in the same country His ways of studying language is just as useless as the way the Nazis studied genetics by assuming the homogenity of the Aryan race  

 Yes thats his point That nearly all of the differences between the two passages are not differences between two languages but just because two different translators
 Earlier you said a sane linguist would take two random people put them to translate a text from Yiddish Actually he got these comparisons from published translations in Romanian and Moldovan He didnt just walk up to random people on the street  

The only actual possible grammatical difference he finds in the texts is Moldovan pe tot ce vretsi and Romanian pe cît vretsi There were very few web results for pe tot ce vreti about 5 and one of them was from the Zdob shi Zdub website a Moldovan band There were no results in Moldova for pe cit vretipe cat vreti So that may or may not be valid I personally would say pe tot ce vretsi But I dont know if its real

 I suppose this is part of an expression such as jur pe tot ce vrei or pun pariu pe tot ce vrei Anyway both sound common enough in Romanian and sounds pretty subjective choosing one for Romanian and one for Moldovan  

Now neither of those expressions is made up He takes both from M Bruchis work one step back two steps forward which is also quite critical of the notion of an independent Moldovan language

 But can this author prove they exist Probably not since no google hits are found  

 Michael Bruchis you mean Im sure he can Hes an expert too He wrote an entire book on the subject Just because no Google hits exist doesnt mean an expression isnt real  do you find any Google results for cit vreti22site3Amd or cat vreti22site3Amd Or even tot ce vreti22site3Amd No you dont But that doesnt mean that nobody says those things in Moldova How many results do you find for instrumente gramaticale 37 and none of them are at md websites You can find the word cuvintelnic on Google but does that mean its really the Moldovan word for dictionar No Moldovan ppl only use that word when were joking dexonlinero finds 0 results too Just because a term occurs or doesnt occur on Google doesnt mean it is or isnt real  

sovetul is not a misspelling Rather its a Sovietera spelling  soviet was spelt as sovet Some Moldovans still spell it that way although its usually considered incorrect however he is quoting the phrase from Bruchis who published his work a bit earlier when the spelling was still accepted  

I agree with your opinion Such an ignorant person like expert Dyer cant be called expert talk  contribs
