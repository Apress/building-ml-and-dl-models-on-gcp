I do not hate Columbia College I hate seeing students waste their time 
Heres a fact Columbia College is unranked by US News and World Report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings This is because it is openadmissions Theres nothing wrong with Wikipedia publishing an article on this school There is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an openadmissions art school and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop Wikipedia is not a brochure  
Being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction In fact the fundamental problem with Columbia College is related to the quality it touts its big Its big because it does not limit its enrollments There is a reason for that Its not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life If it did it wouldnt be so expensive It does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get 
Now the members of its administration its PR department and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality in order to make art one needs talent Talent is by definition inborn and innate You dont get it by acquiring skill You dont get it by purchasing the most expensive camera or the most expensive education money can buy Youre born with it and by late adolescence if youve got it it will make itself apparent 
Therefore any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closedadmissions art school one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work These schools are also very expensive but its possible to get various kinds of financial aid Once in the program the talented painter photographer writer or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students That creates an entirely different atmosphere one that keeps the student on his or her toes as it were and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better 
You might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent Its because talent does not hide itself it is apparent to experts in the field 
There are two ways in which Columbia covers up this fact by telling students that if theyre showing up and willing to pay big bucks then theyre talented Its easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she and its usually a he who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent 
The other means at Columbias disposal is that for the last thirty years children have been taught that selfesteem is the most important quality they can develop In a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of selfesteem schools have simply stopped talking about talent They might at times call it merit but that too is a bad word So an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the drive to succeed youll succeed The problem what if youve get the drive to succeed but reaching down within yourself you find youve got nothing to express
If you think Columbia loves you try falling behind on your tuition Good luck
