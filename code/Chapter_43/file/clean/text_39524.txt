Replaceable fair use ImageRonda L Ellerjpg 

Thanks for uploading ImageRonda L Ellerjpg I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of fair use but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first nonfree content criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information If you believe this media is not replaceable please

 Go to the media description page and edit it to add  without deleting the original replaceable fair use template
 On the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all

Alternatively you can also choose to replace this nonfree media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or similar media under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself

If you have uploaded other nonfree media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our nonfree content criteria You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on  this link Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above nonfree media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification 7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006 per our nonfree content policy  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you Do you want to opt out of receiving this notice Â Parrot
