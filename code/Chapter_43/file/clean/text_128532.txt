They are not my POV There are enough WPRS to support Sri Lankan Ethnic Conflict started immediately after the independence of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Civil War was subsequently after that We can summarize the Ethnic Conflict or Sri Lanka Civil War in the main article Sri Lanka and then direct to the main article Again Sri Lanka is much known by outside world for its Civil War than its more than 3000 years old history is not a PoV at all because every other country and region has more than 3000 years old history in the world and why they should look at Sri Lanka other than its bloody Civil War or its unresolved Ethnic Conflict Only those who want to hide the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka only want to hide it on Wikipedia also But that wont work over the time
