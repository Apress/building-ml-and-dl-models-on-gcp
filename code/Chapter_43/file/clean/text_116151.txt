I question the choice of using a standard disambiguation page rather than what I would think is more appropriate where precipitation is the meteorological meaning and contains a link to precipitation chemistry The vast majority of links to precipitation are going to be for the meteorological meaning IMHO at least from what I can see from using the What links here Unless someone objects I will consider making this change in a few days or so  0356 Mar 26 2004 UTC

Youre dead right about most of the links going to the weather article Im disambiguating ppt at the moment dont let it put your plan though  2352 27 Mar 2004 UTC

See also my response on the Village pump which is the proper forum for issues like this   Talk 1227 Mar 29 2004 UTCAlso precipitation is rain forms like halesnowsleet and hale

I did post it on the Village Pump but the topic has already been archived but I did find your reply My suggested change is one of the standard disambiguation options It most cases the current method selected in having a standard disambiguation page works fine for me In this case however I think one of the other options as pointed out above is more suitable IMHO Since the chemistry definition is relatively obscure to most people I think I think the most well known definition should be front and center Look at London for example  0140 Mar 30 2004 UTC

 Ha  Found this after I had mostly replaced all the links with the disambig precipitation
