Well actually i was looking a bit more for articles about Umbrella Consulting in papers such as the New York Times or on the larger news sites Anything that published by a third party source Meaning not your company or anyone related to your company which has a substantial size Which means no local newspapers Of course the articles must provide a bit more information then just menrioning UMBRELLA Consultings name

 To give you an idea what good sources are have a look at the Primavera Systems article under the section references The links provided there are examples of good independent sources  Contact meContribs
