If you like Ill take it to arbcom or the like  Opposing the inclusion of an image that accurately depicts something described in the text is nonsense it actually refers specifically to a flag that uses Pantone colors that match to those used in the image in question Im not talking about where the text generically refers to flag of Italy  Its of course even more nonsensical when no relevant justification is givenbut I digress  If you dont like or dont care Ill just reinclude the image forthwith as such action would be well within the bounds of consensus Wikipedia policy and the purpose of Wikipedia in general
