You treated me ill  Please do not misquote me thats not what I said  I said I have been treated very badly FFN too in a general sense by those of the opposing opinion  Again read the discussion so far  I thought you wanted to get back on topic

I never said I was exempt from anything  Are you making accusations that Ive violated a policy  That in and of itself would be an attack on my character  Again I thought you wanted to get back on topic

You dont want to help with refs but the complaint is that they arent good enough  Ok how is your contribution productive or helpful then  I have plenty of good refs already  If someone doesnt like them for some odd reason well then they need to go get some they do like instead of arguing mine  Pretty simple
