Ill explain it again shall I Bilinge Hospital was closer to Wigan than it was to St Helens By road Billinge Hospital to St Helens 69 miles St Helens to Whiston Hospital 48 miles Why would someone drive to Billinge from the middle of St Helens when thier wife was giving birth when they could be at Whiston faster what would be the point Why would I want to put Wigan in every article A good 7580 per cent of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan were born at Billinge Hospital not just the immediate area ieWigan Orrell Pem Ince etc etc A much smaller percentage of the of the Met Borough of St Helens ie Rainford Haydock Garswood Billinge Chapel End were born there most were born at Whiston including those from the centre of St Helens as Whiston is closer Why is this not reflected in the article I put the word Wigan in the article when it needs to be in it ie Bilinge Hospital was the prnciple maternity facility for the Wigan and northern St Helens areas What is wrong about that
