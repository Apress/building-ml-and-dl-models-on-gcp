 Hi
 Unfortunately I referred you to the talk page without realising Josephzemskova23 had vandalised the talk page and stripped out significant and contradictory references from that talk page on 24 February including foreign sources and interviews that support a birth year of 1977 Further a google turns up no evidence Joseph Zemskova as a manager or anything else Maybe I missed something but I spotted no undisputed indicators that 1980 is her birth year On the whole the preponderance of evidence in the deleted talk page references appears to be 1977 You can see part of the original supporting references on the simpleenglish talk page
best regards  say 0348
