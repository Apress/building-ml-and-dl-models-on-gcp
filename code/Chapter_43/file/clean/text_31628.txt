User Denmark template 

Hi Ssolbergj For the time being Ive reverted your edit to this template If you wish to change it might I suggest that you ask around first if people agree Alternatively the white template can be substd to the affected userpages However I cant help but notice that Dannebrog red and grey make a very bad combination The red is dusty on its own but it gets amplified by also adding grey Why not ask on the Danish Wikipedians noticeboard how people feel Cheers  T  C
