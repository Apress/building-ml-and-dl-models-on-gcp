Biochemistry Vandalism
PLEASE if you are not sure about something please discuss it here Steroids include phytosterols Phytosterols are not derived from cholesterol otherwise all vegan people would be in deep trouble  In general there is a tendency to write comments from a human perspective Please remember that compounds are found throughout nature and span many living organisms That said I removed the anonymous persons comments that all steroids come from cholesterol who he removed my previous comments on the HMGCoA pathway I added lanosterol and squalene instead  Thanks

removed section and reasons

TABThe first Steroid was a product developed in the 1930s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate Once Steroids were proven effective on animals Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII The Germans saw that their POWs Prisoners of War were suffering from malnutrition so they made the decision to treat them with steroids The steroids helped prevent muscle loss thus making them live longer It wasnt until the mid 1950s where steroids were first used in professional sports Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting
TABThere are many types of Steroids but the most common of them all is anabolicandrogenic  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings Anabolic means increasing body tissue mostly muscle So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically it can cause the user to become more prone to injury The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part This part is highly related to the male hormone testosterone This increases facial hair baldness nervousness bad breath and much more The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own Doctors however prescribe only about 410 mg a day whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses unless your body is lacking testosterone Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids they can also be taken a couple different ways The most common way to take Steroids is through injection this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle The user then injects the needle directly in the skin like a shot in the doctors office This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills Pills are chea
