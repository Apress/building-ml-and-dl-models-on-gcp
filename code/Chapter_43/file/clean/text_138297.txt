User Vaishnava on the Article Vishnu 

Hi Maam I really appreciate your politeness in addressing my edits and also explaining to me kindly about the issue I now understand it However I would like to submit that the sacred texts like the Yajurveda Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are accepted as authoritative texts on the Hindu religion by a majority of the Hindus These three texts namely the Yajurveda the Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are a part of Hinduism and not just Vaishnavism To describe my edits as purely a Vaishnavite point of view means that the sacred texts like the Yajurveda the Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are not a part of Hinduism The language used by me only state the facts of Hindu Religion and not a POINT of View of Vaishnavism For Example the Quran declares Allah as the Supreme God Now if this is mentioned it is not a point of view but a fact that the Quran describes Allah in that manner  UserVaishnava  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
