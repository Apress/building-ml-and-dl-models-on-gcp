Updating biographical information of self 

Hi Wikipedians If anyone is interested I have been updating my own biography which had fallen a little out of date For example a new edition of one of the published works mentioned was published on 9 June 2013 It is not a commercial publication therfore I posit I am not adding information about the revised edition for personal commercial gain The book is a community environmental resource I hope my material on myself is transparent balanced and written according to Wikipedia guidelines despite my obvious conflict of interest The Wikimedia community here in Brisbane Queensland is not very active at the moment I am a member of Wikimedia Australia and all the editors I know I havent been in contact for some time and I suspect they havent the time to look at the page and update it On balance I believe it is better to update the page myself to reflect true facts than leave it out of date I would welcome any copmments suggestions or feedback on this matter
