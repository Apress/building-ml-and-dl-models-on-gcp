I looked again a bit more carefully and interestingly enough I still see no articles at all that even mention the fact that the final result was way off from the poll numbers much less analyze possible reasons why that was the case  One that I did find though noted that its margin of error in its poll of likely voters which showed Leppert up 4745 was unusually high almost six percent because of low confidence in their determination of which voters were actually likely to turn out  

Since at this point it seems no reliable sources are raising the issue of whether something like the Bradley effect occurred I dont think there is a basis right now to include it in the article
