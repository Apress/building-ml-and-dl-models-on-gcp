Administrator intervention against vandalism 

Thank you for your recent reports at WikipediaAdministrator intervention against vandalism One of the reports was very helpful and has resulted in a block however you also made two reports on IP addresses that have not edited for some time in one case not for two and a half years We do not block IP addresses unless the vandalism is currently going on as it is entirely likely that the same user is not currently using the same IP address
