Aces of ANSI Art
Looking back it appears that the article was Proposed for Deletion with the rationale that the group was nonnotable and that the article lacked sources and was abandoned That was in September 2008 the edit prior to this was in November 2006 No one objected to the deletion so I deleted it without prejudice If you like I am happy to restore what little was there to your userspace so you have a template to start with The only source was a zip archive of examples from the group 

I dont know enough about the ANSI scene back then to judge notability in this case but if you have sources that discuss the group in a neutral fashion and if those sources are reliable then I think an article might be worthwhile So let me know what youd like to do and Ill take care of it If youd prefer a fresh start that works too  your call Best   Said  Did
