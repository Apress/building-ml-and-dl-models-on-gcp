Support the removal of Iran  Conditions are different in Iran than in the Arab world  Its not connected to the Arab world in the same way that the Arab states are connected to each other and is only included by dint of being a Middle Eastern autocracy  But I believe that WPCOMMON should be our guide and in this regard media seems to be contrasting Iran with the Arab countries rather than including them
I ran a Google News search for Iran Arab Spring and will list a rundown of the treatment by sources on the first page
The Christian Science Monitor refers to protests sweeping the Arab World
The Huffington Post refers to another spring on the Iranian scene
The next two articles and two later down talk about the threat posed by Iran to the Arab Spring  or Arab World 
The next article talks about Blackwater for some reason 
Jerusalem Post calls its article Arab spring Persian winter Nuff said
The BBC includes Iran with China and Azerbaijan as related protests 
The AFP Whatever that is says that Iran is different from the Arab countries but also uses Arab spring to refer to the protesters there  At four days old its the second oldest source on the front page 
The oldest article coming from The Telegraph doesnt provide any indications either way 
In short all these articles either exclude Iran entirely from the Arab Spring recognize it as distinct from the Arab countries or remain silent on the issue
