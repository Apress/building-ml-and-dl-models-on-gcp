AntiLove Song 

I moved your information from the talk page to the main article It looks shorter now but I kept everything The main reason it is shorter is because phrases like from RavenSymones fourth album RavenSymone just become from the album

This is the right way to handle singles that never charted They dont get an individual article but theres nothing at all wrong  with putting the infobox and description in the album article

We havent been working well together but Id like to try and change that I can see that you are an editor that wants to do things right Unfortunately part of doing things right is to not create articles that fail guidelines The guidelines for article creation on singles are at WPNSONGS which I kept pointing at every time I redirected one of these articles or nominated it for deletion Following guidelines is important and if you do so we should get along much better
