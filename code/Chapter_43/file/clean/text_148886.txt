I noticed that the location of the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran was appearing incorrectly within the Google Earth Geographic Web layer  This may have occurred from the split of the articles for the city of Dhahran and the Aramco Dhahran camp discussed elsewhere within this articles discussion the locations for both appear to have defaulted to Dhahran International Airport possibly because of the use of a geocoded photo of the airport within the articles and the fact that no specific coordinate for Aramco Dhahran camp was given within this article  I have set the location for the Aramco Dhahran camp at Kings Road Ball Field for a variety of reasons such as the facts that this ball field was the location of many social activities and that it is recognizable by Aramco Brats of all ages which is not true of other locations within the camp for example the locations of the entrance gates have changed over time  I set the coordinates in accordance with the Google Earth Geographic Web layer and the Wikipedia coord template
