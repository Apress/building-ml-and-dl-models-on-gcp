Here are my thoughts on the questions youve posed
Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles if they dont have one now  Ive added links to articles where I could them  Id say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek  Red Butte Rocky Ridge Echo Canyon and Emigration Canyon  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa Nebraska settled by the Latterday Saints as a supply point and This Is The Place Heritage Park  Im sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections like the eastern Wyoming sites Some suggested sections  Iowa mostly covering the 1840s the Missouri River area Winter Quarters  Kanesville  Florence Missouri River to Fort Laramie For Laramie to Fort Bridger with a focus on the handcart companies and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence
And how are we to deal with elapsed time as early companies had different experiences than later companies  One chunk for geography and another for linear time I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article  Would it make sense to tackle both of these articles at once to try to ensure that they compliment each other without simply being repetitive
