Photo Agenda 

Why do all of the photos of Obama posing with one other Politician exclusively include Republicans  This seems to be a political decision to portray Obama as bipartisan by showing him only with Republicans  Things like this however subtle undermine the integrity of the article because they suggest a deliberate effort to portray the president in a certain light that they find advantageous to him politically The point is that it doesnt make sense to show Obama with only Republican senators and not a single democratic senator    JohnHistory
