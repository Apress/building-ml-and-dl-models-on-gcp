I would really like to begin such an article I believe it can be created and it could be a great article There are many people who dont practice a religion yet have opinions about the morality of homosexual acts for instance In my high school whenever we had a debate about homosexuality and someone was against or in favor of the acceptance of homosexuality the arguments used were never religious and yet a discussion about the morality of homosexuality would happen Maybe those commmon arguments could be in this article Like the common view that it is not natural to be gay and therefore it is wrong And the common answer to this which states that we all do things which are not natural every day like driving a car and using condoms Or the other answer which would see it as being natural The samesex marriage article has some of those moral views independent of a religion
