I have to add that some people for example Sj√∂ may claim that Im disqualified from editing articles in Wikipedia by my own research Such a claim does however also disqualify all scientists from editing Wikipedia in all matters except those they do know anything about that is qualifies them to edit only those matters they dont know anything about This is just one more example of cladists inconsistent reasoning The reason for this kind of reasoning is that they do not have any criteria to distinguish true from false which in science is agreement with facts I am prepared to discuss any issue with anyone without ever deleting their opinions and if they show me to be wrong I will change my mind My personality is not attached to my comprehension and conceptualization of reality Personality is deeper than talk Mats Envall presently at 832542053
