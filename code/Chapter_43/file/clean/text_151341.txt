I cannot report it anywhere since I am blocked at the moment Bakharevs accusation was based on the fact that the user returned my edits on one article nothing else There is nothing strange about it since almost any Finn would replace those Swedish names with Finnish ones when talking about Finnish speaking cities in Finland A Svecoman accused me of being a sock in fiwiki too but I requested that IPdetector be used and I was proven innocent  it could be done here too if some people are really so paranoid
