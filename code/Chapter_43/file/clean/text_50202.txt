Weapon demos  Soundtrack 

I feel something ought to be said about the weapon demos unlockable in the console versions of this game  something unique to the Soul Calibur series
Also I have hear it said that some music tracks  I cannot remember which  play in time to the demonstrations Confirmation and clarification of this would be interesting
