Female genital mutilation 
The page has been moved I went through and changed all the FGC to FGM as well as some of the usage of the word cutting in the article I didnt change every instance of cutting to mutilation because in some cases it was referring to the act of cutting and not the overall mutilation If youre gonna change anything else I would think it through a lot its not worth provoking the people who like the term FGC because it will just incite an edit war and give ammunition to the people who think FGC should be used for neutrality reasons In fact it wouldnt surprise me if a request to move back to FGC comes down the line sometime soon
