ok agree is this suitable I still think  to reasonably define the lemma  it is needed to mention the rough figures 130 and 13 when the debt crisis started but not as a cause and it it short enough to qualify for a lead

Ok taking into account the various discussions thanks for the constructive contributions I am deriving a lead start not mentioning the 130 debt and 13 deficit ratios so nobody is inclined to think this is already mentioning the causes

 The Greek governmentdebt crisis also known as the Greek Depression is an ongoing multiyear crisis having begun between late 2009 and April 2010 At that time Greece had a 300 billion debt level This situation was broadly recognized as the start of the Greek governmentdebt crisis because Greece lost the ability to service its existing debt as it was neither capable to refinance due payments with new debt issues because of a reduced creditworthiness nor able to meet its debt obligations via a budget surplus including any sale of assets
 Starting autumn 2010 the eurozone states Ireland Portugal Spain and Cyprus also slid into a debt crisis These debt crisis together including the Greek one also have been referred to as the European debt crisis The five debt crisis shared some similarities but also had its differences with respect to causes measures and crisis evolvement

The third paragraph should now list the causes I have no problems that overlapping causes are listed as that is how reality was I also have no problems if there is one sentence about there being special views on causes but please lets stop to put sources close to Marxism in any prominence as these is not the broad view
