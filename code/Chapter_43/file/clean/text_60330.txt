Linux Source Code 
Acer have not released the complete source code of the Linus Lite installed on the Aspite One so I removed the following sentence from the page
 In accordance with the GPL Acer has released the source code for Linpus Linux Lite and their modified Linux operating system
Facts
 The sources published do not match the installed versions
 Sources for some important packages like the Thunar file manager are missing
 The source rpm of xfdesktopacerlp the simplified UI contains precompiled binaries instead of code
 The Linux kernel sources do not contain the source code of the madwifi stack needed for wifi
 The entry for the r8108 module is missing from the kernel config so its not possible to build the driver for the included ethernet card
When all these issues are fixed the sentence I removed can be inserted again but until then its wrong
