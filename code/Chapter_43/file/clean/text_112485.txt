I disagree  If there are stated suspicions there should be a cite You cite ABC News as the source of the memo  If there is a challenge that should be cited too  I do not care if Powerline is mentioned directly  I would do it but if you think it is too much information fair enough  But the Powerline link should be left there so a viewer can go look at it 1816 25 Mar 2005 UTC
