Outline of knowledge WikiProject update  04022009 

Hi everyone

Things are going slow again  Where have you been

Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition

 Who are we competing with 

Encyclopedia Britannica  Specifically with its Outline of knowledge presented in its volume called the Propaedia  Currently theyre kicking our asses  Youve really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge available only in the encyclopedias paper edition  not the online version

Portals Informally of course just for the fun of it  There are around 600 portals  Were about 100 behind them with about 500 outlines  Lets blow past them and leave em in the dust

 Confusion in editors at large 

Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper article space recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia

However Ive noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages and complain that they are redundant to articles  Well ya  Thats the point of an outline  to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding for easy viewing and faster reading and to provide a topical guide  

A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization

These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before going public to prevent their expansion as the communitys awareness of these pages increases  Consider the response wed get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects 500 article talk pages and placed links in 500 see also sections etc

That could be a nightmare

So

 Encyclopedic and administrative support 

Ive been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice   Theyre drafts still under construction  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them directly or by providing feedback

First is an  article draft intended to replace the current Outline article

Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages

Let me know what you think  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia  What is missing  How can they be improved
