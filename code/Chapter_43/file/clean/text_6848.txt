Relevance 

In a New Zealand TV2 series presented by Rebecca Gibney called Sensing Murder which aired on TVNZ beginning in 2006 three psychic mediums from Australia and New Zealand Sue Nicholson Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death The team of investigators followed up the psychics leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims remains27 Skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources282930 and it was further satirized in the season finale where host Jeremy Wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved31

Just how relevant is this Granted it does provide criticism yet it is from a television show We are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few If high profile mediums were used I would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion

Whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section
