Dear Aucaman I was a bystander during last few months watching your edits and other Kurdish wikipedians edits  and associated discussions  without interfereing I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes I voted and I take the responsibility for it If you read my comments on the same page you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view without mentioning any specific point about you To me the story was over However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies they actually did so And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages About Cyrus I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups National heros prophets Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them Besides you are by no means an expert on these issues About your alleged ethnicity it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd Iranian or Russian You need to revise your views If you were persian you would need an even more extensive revision This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint
