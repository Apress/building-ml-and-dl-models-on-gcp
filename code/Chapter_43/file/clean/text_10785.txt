First of all remain civil Dont accuse me of something I am not User 217 is blocked because of vandalism I have nothing to do with him if you dont believe me ask administrators

Second I dont understand why you have deleted the whole article It doesnt matter do you agree with it or not you should not delete something with the source it is against the rules It is obvious you like Franjo Tudjman thats ok with me but Wikipedia is something else It is clearly designeted that the witness said something It is not put as it is verified fact but the testimony is verified fact As Okun described it etc Cheers
