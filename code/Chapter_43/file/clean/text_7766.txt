Sitush no need to pretend as if you really apologise i know about your attitude  behaviour   

Joshua Jonathan I am telling this to youas there is no need for you to pretend that you have examined the sourcesi have seen your examination which is totally unjustifiable and not valid and also i dont have faith in you because even you includes the group of users to support sitush who make conspiracies in editing articlesI know how you edit articles  also how you support sitush

And also another thing i have to saythat there is no proof needed and also no need of wikipedias acceptance that Sun rises in east
In the similar waythat Rajus or rajulu is not a caste nametheir caste name is Kshatriya which is mentioned by Government of India

httpwikianswerscomQIs_kshatriya_raju_caste_a_forward_or_backward_casteslide1  httpwikianswerscomQWhat_caste_raju_belong_to_in_Sikhism  httpwikianswerscomQWhat_caste_does_Raju_belong_to

It is as foolish as Sun rises in west like way that a christian European like you  a group of shudras when centuries back doesnt have the ability to touch the boots of Kshatriyas when they lived in palaces  Kingdomsnow people like you  your pack are judging the Kshatriyas to be Kshatriyas or notI know you always support unreliable books written in favour of low class Dalitsconverted christians  BahujansShudras beacause of your anti upper caste Hindu attitudePeople will laugh at you and your mate SitushAll the users like sitush  his pack of dogs will definitely pay for the conspiracy when the time comes and also because truth is even supported and protected by god

Finallyremember what should be done to this Rajus article will definitely be doneThank You
