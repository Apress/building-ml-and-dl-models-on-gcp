Error in the Sinfonias and two part inventions on the Bach Page 

The J S Bach page claimed and I quote from the page under other keyboard works

The 15 Inventions and 15 Sinfonias BWV 772801 These are short two and threepart contrapuntal works arranged in order of key signatures of increasing sharps and flats omitting some of the less used ones The pieces were intended by Bach for instructional purposes

This however isnt true The sinfonias and inventions are NOT written in increasing number of sharps and flats they are written in chromatic order from C up to B omitting some of the lesser used ones I have played most of the sinfonias and inventions in piano and was shocked that someone wrote something as erroneous as this 

Its like saying that the Welltempered Clavier were written in some random order  COMPLETELY NOT TRUE
