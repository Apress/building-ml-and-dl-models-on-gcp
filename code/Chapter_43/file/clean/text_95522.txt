Blocked status 

As I said before I have no quarrel with anyone Id like to be unblocked Id like help with my editing so that it is proper to wiki standards 
I had no idea that it wasnt proper to email the editors directly I looked but didnt see any other contact info so thats where I went I did not think of or really know to much about the discussion pages etc at least not as much as I do know 
I see now that if you dispute an edit simply go to the discussion page and hash it out there and a third party will intervene
In this instance I know tempers and emotions went overboard but there really was no threats or real harassment or either end
If you look the night that I made the update I contacted Cliff C another editor Id dealt with in the past to look over my adjustment and to see if it fit correctly or was inappropriate in anyway 
You see Questioning The Report was there for years and Cliff and I worked to get it a way that it fit When the book went online I added another small section in this area The change alone was not removed but the entire section which ticked me off as I worked to get it there
So I ask to be unblocked so I can work with these editors again in a beneficial way in the future
