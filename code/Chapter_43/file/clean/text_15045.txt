Welcome

Hello Directorsara and welcome to Wikipedia Thank you for your contributions

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest In other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone you might like to draft your revised article before submission and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it See our help page on userspace drafts for more details If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation If your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username

If you are stuck and looking for help please come to the New contributors help page where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have You can also just type  on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions Here are a few other good links for newcomers
