Ive made a start as youve seen I think the mistake made by the prior failed guideline was to be too prescriptive for individual types of event and the essay at WikipediaNews articles doesnt strike the right tone for me  its too negative about articles about events and it is too wordy We need to bear in mind that we want to try to distill general principles of the community consensus about these articles  and acknowledge where no consensus exists  rather than try to impose new rules which will never succeed Windows
