I removed 2 sentences from the lead
His mother was a sexually active widow who at James 5 years of age consistently has men over to amuse her She was aroused by different males and this trait was said to have been passed down to James While in the White house James was said to have had many different women over behind the first ladys backgiven the nature of the subject matter and this is a biography article I felt the need for citations  I was going to just throw a tag on the sentences but after going through the article the sexually active mother and subsequent adultery in the white house is not mentioned  Since the lead is supposed to be summarizing what Im going to read I expected more on this matter  If there are references for it by all means please put it back in though if this is the only mention were going to make about it then I recommend it be moved into the Bio section of the article  Or I could be wrong and it was just some slightly more clever than usual vandalism  But assuming good faith  tyvm
