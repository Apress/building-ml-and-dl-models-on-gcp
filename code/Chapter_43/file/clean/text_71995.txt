Cultural references 

Noting that the Cultural references section was deleted I thought it worth discussing whether this was an appropriate move  As a point of comparison the article US Route 66 has a subsection entitled Route 66 and pop culture and the highway has become enough a cultural icon that I dont think an argument for the removal of the section would pass muster  Dixie Highway may not have as much notoriety as Route 66 but it has enough enough that it is worth asking can a case be made for Dixie Highway being enough of a cultural icon that it deserves mention in the article
