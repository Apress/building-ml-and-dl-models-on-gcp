Thanks for getting back to me about the proposal for the bot for 10  Sorry I took a few days to reply things are incredibly busy for me right now  Ill try to answer
 is the bot to just make the list of articles above a certain quality and importance and mark out any problems making a table for example YES as far as I can say at this point in time
 Also will it run off a category to check or another sort of list If you mean run off in the sense of use as a source then it will use the talk page categories just like Mathbot  If you mean run off in the sense of produce it will produce the worlist log alphabetical list and statistics also like Mathbot
Does this clarify things  You should probably take a look at how Mathbot does its thing and ask Oleg any seriously technical questions  he may be able to give you some of his code  Those who have looked at Mathbots code have commented that it is very nicely done Once again many thanks for taking an interest in this if this can work out it will transform our productivity in the next year from the 15000 range into the 1050000 article range Cheers
