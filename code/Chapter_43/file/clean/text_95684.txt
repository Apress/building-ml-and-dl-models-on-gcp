Youre right I did delete the section on the 8th December after MgeKelly inserted the Monty Burns factoid He was possibly trying to get me to lose my temper and he unfortunately succeeded

The sequence of events thus runs this way
You create a compromise
Mgekelly vandalizes the article with the Monty Burns factoid
I deleted the whole section and reinserted the factoid in the main body

Please note that I deleted the section two days after you created it on the 6th Note that I was on wikipedia on the 7th I saw the section then and did not touch it 

SoI should not have deleted the whole section I should have deleted only the Monty Burns vandalism and I apologize for not having appreciated your early effort at a compromise  0343 10 Jan 2005 UTC
