I strongly disagree that the City of Largo photo is unacceptable but I do agree that also having a photo as Susan is necessary Since starting this article backwhen I occasionally check in the edit history with the photo has been that for a time there was a photo as Susan though editors at the time still kept the caption claiming it was the official City of Largo photo which it wasnt Unfortunately the photo provided was a copyvio from a photo session Susan did with I believe the St Petersburg times I would recommend that if anyone has an email or whatever with Susan that they contact her  see if she might herself be willing to provide a current photo Im betting shed be willing given her apparent commitment to using her experience positively towards educating the public about trans issues
Meanwhile I support removing the City of Largo official photo from the bio infobox  having it only further down in the article
