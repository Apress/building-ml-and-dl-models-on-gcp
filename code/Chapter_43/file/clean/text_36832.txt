Please do refer to the following language of the speedy deletion process too  Before nominating an article for speedy deletion consider whether an article could be improved or reduced to a stub speedy deletion is for cases where an article does not contain useful content Note that some Wikipedians create articles in multiple saves so try to avoid deleting a page too soon after its initial creation Users nominating a page for speedy deletion should specify which criteria the page meets it would also be considerate to notify the original author
So there was no notification and I had not even have had the time in the last half hour to add content as we are in this discussion
I am doing it in multiple saves hold your horses please
