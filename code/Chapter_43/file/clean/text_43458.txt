I should warn you that WikipediaArticles for deletionJeremy Issacharoff 2nd nomination may come to haunt you in a hypothetical RFA  Lets compare your nomination to mine

 Problem 1st nomination 2nd nomination References Poorly referenced Poorly referenced autobiography it may violate the autobiography guideline probable autobiography Sockpuppet based on evidence at WikipediaSuspected sock puppetsIssacharoff see WikipediaSuspected sock puppetsIssacharoff and WikipediaSuspected sock puppetsIssacharoff 2nd 

Notice the similarities  Notice also that the article was deleted both times

Now read part of the rationale for an opposition to my last RFA I do not trust with a delete button someone who thinks I have not actually read the article but I think it might be autobiographical is a valid deletion reason
 Of course that was not my full deletion reason  You should be prepared for opposition the same way I was opposed  for daring to nominate an article that was actually deleted for a valid reason
