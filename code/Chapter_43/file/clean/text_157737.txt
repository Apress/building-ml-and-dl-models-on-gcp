Misdirected Debate 

The threads on this entry have gotten misdirected in a zealous comparison with MPT which is interesting but not especially relevant  Perhaps the word Portfolio has become a flash point but I see only limited value in that line of discussion  Its a footnote and only loosely related to the issues addressed by PPM  I agree with Nickmalik that a more practical definition would be useful
