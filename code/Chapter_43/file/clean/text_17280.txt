Please add the following information to the Public Image section of Lady Gagas page

Lady Gagas public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand Her 28 million Twitter followers and 52 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product Hampp 2010 With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music fashion and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality Hampp 2010

I think that section already basically says that  Also we dont list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because theres no way to really verify that information  are those real people  Are there any sockpuppet accounts  Anyway the article basically says all that already   

 Drugtaking 

Shouldnt something be said about her drug taking She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music while drinking whiskey Its mentioned on other musicians articles so why not here 90193141136  
Im surprised her former cocaine habit isnt mentioned here as well seeing as shes talked about it in multiple places now 60 Minutes Vanity Fair 1281632426
