Todays UT Air crash 

Hi I noticed that when you edited List of notable accidents and incidents on commercial airliners you listed the flight number of todays crash as 471 I have started an artilce on the crash however at present the title is 2007 Samara Tu134 aircraft crash because I have been unable to locate a reference for the flight number I would be interested to know what your source was for the flight number as upon seeing that I could move the page to the better title of the flight number  Talk  Contribs
