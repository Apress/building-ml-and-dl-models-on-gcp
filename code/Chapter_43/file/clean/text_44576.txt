Comment It would have been helpful to provide links to the sources sited  Also it is not necessary to provide intext mention of sources of facts  Words in scare quotes should not be used in headings since they raise the question of who is using the term  Comparing the text with a summary provided by the CSM I find a few apparent inaccuracies in the text  The IRS did not flag the 75 groups for review of their taxexempt status  Instead they flagged new applications for taxexempt status for new Tea Party groups formed in the runup to the 2012 election  Groups whose main activity is support of political candidates and parties are ineligible for taxexempt status  The CSM does not say that asking for donor lists is a violation of IRS policy just that it is not typically required  I do not see either the need to quote so many people  Just citing Republican and Tea Party sources makes it appear that they are the only ones who hold that opinion  Why not just summarize the general reaction to the story  that the IRS has abused its power by failing to be nonpolitical nonpartisan and neutral
