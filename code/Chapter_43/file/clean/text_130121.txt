You declined to block me for vandalism as you determined it was a content dispute however it is barely a content dispute The other user who reported me is entering information from a silly top 100 list into music articles as some type of award or achievement for the article topic However the author of the list states that the list was chosen arbitrarily and with bias The other user has been informed of this and simply ignores it and also blanks their page to hide any mention of it while continuing to revert the information back into the articles around 100 different articles As a result I dont believe this to be a content dispute I took this issue to the reliable references board to try and get some help but there was no one available to review it as the reference is written in Japanese even though I made it easy to cross check without knowing Japanese The Rolling Stone magazine in question is viewable here wwwamazoncojpRollingStoneローリングストーン2007年09月号dpB000UCGUXYrefpd_sxp_f_pt and on the cover of the magazine where it says BEST 100 in English above that is the following sentence 独断と偏見で選んだ written in green just below the purple line as a disclaimer A google translate will show it means chosen arbitrarily and with prejudice and it is also written in the description section on the product page How is this acceptable for the wikipedia 273314393
