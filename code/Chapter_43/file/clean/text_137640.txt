UserPhoenix of9 you clearly do not have consensus to make your proposed edits and now that Warrens invocation at Obamas inauguration is in the past you will have trouble finding editors who agree with you in attacking Warren thats why it was protected prior to the inauguration You already have had two other veteran editors of this article say that your edits were inappropriate again we just dealt with another editor similar to you and I guarantee that at least two more editors would join us if you attempt to post them again You also have absolutely zero credibility because of your admitted bias against Warren so attempting to outargue us is ridiculous If you continue all you will accomplish is getting this article protected again Youre not going to win this  walk away from the article
