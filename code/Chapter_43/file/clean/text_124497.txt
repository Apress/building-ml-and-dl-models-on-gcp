It is very sad that some WP people have to commit suicide to get their asses out of the WikiGame It is quite obvious what you did to yourself here You appear the type that cares so deeply for the project and other people that you took so much stress upon yourself personally for others woes I only knew you for a very short time and you were a little offthewall for me and probably WP but your past work here was not wasted and you deserve your break I know it will haunt you and you will want to come back so I regret this has happened to you but it was obviously your dying wish I wish the whole ordeal didnt appear so nasty towards you and do not totally agree with the outcome as being too harsh  Youll be back cause I know you cant stay away too long without itching Best of luck WP was a better place for your efforts You have won with your time off and you did prove some points about the failure of the system No system is perfect on all fronts anyway All the best and heal those nerves Empaths deserve some RR frequently Revert your brain three times 9925112565
