 I appreciate you looking for a WP3O but I really dont think it was needed  Granted Im not sure consensus as one would use the word in closing an XfD would be the exact wording  BUT there are indeed a few folks who support an unblock  Administrators are tasked with making judgement calls about what is best for the community and you did fine in that regard  At least one other administrator was considering unblocking so you were hardly alone in your thoughts  As youve stated before should there be additional problems they can be reblocked and Im sure there will be plenty of eyes on the RO edits for a while
 On a personal note  I apologize if my comment about consensus above was troublesome       1638
