Generations of the Impala 
I have always thought of a generation of a car to mean specific body styles of a car When a cars body style changes it is a new generation sorry if that sounds convulted but 

Anyhow the infoboxes stating the generations of the Impala may be wrong and it may be worth checking out For the record heres how I understand the generations of the Impala 1958 first 1959 second 1961 third 1965 fourth 1967 fifth 1969 sixth 1971 seventh 1977 eighth 1980 ninth 1994 10th 2000 11th and 2006 12th
