Wankel engine
Your text is sure not documented I think you have never seen a Wankel engine from inside In other respects would you know that common piston ring material like Goetze cast iron IKA3 and IKA33 is used for the apex seals Trochoiden surface chrome chrome molybdenum molybdenum combined with construction steel apex seals Nikasil etc The side surface is reagular cast iron or over eutectic alu KSxx etc  The cooling surface is smaller as for a comparable reciprocating piston engine and then should you compare the same displacement volume Chamber volume is two times for the displacement A 13ltr Wankel has a displacment of a 26ltr and only a surface like a 13ltr 4T reciprocating piston engine That why water cooler is smaller per kW
