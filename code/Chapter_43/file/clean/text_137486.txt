Frustrating 
Spent the last couple of days trying to obtain free images from notable people No luck except I got an email reply from the Bmovie actress Kelli Maroney She emailed me a photo to use in her article but forgot to include the GFDL permission and hasnt replied to my followup  A bunch of work for nothing
