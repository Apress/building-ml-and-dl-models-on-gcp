Cast vs Character Info Formatting  AiW  

Commenting here to address one thing not directly related though somewhat applicable to the debated article  I disagree that adding bullets or some other form of breakdelineation indicates a difficulty in reading a paragraph  It was something I often saw used in printed encyclopedias a couple decades back depending on the flow of information and details   

However to maintain the paragraph format and avoid lists I feel the material will need to be overhauled  As it currently reads which may well be the problem some delineation felt necessary  Thus I think the entry in question could do with a revision so that the production notescharacter notes are completely separate from the actorcharacter list  Just my two cents
