Do you know what vandalism is 

My comments as you in bold

24243187152 has committed a mild amount of vandalism on The Andy Milonakis Show It appears that he was attempting to make a joke but after other users have reverted him I left him a vandalism warning He has only made one vandalistic edit since then 

I havent actually read the article and I dont understand the edit and I dont know what the vandalism is but Im sure its there

Even if Im mistaken in my judgement as to it being vandalism he has also violated 3RR on the article It appears he has also made several personal attacks even after his final warning137138139140 Many of his attacks seem to be the reposting of a single attack that has been removed Wildnoxtalk 

So its not so much that hes done multiple things as one single thing But Im simple enough that this distinction escapes me
