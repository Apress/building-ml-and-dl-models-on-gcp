Some notes 

Hi Amoruso in regards to your edits on Palestinian refugee and Palestinian exodus I want to ask you for a favor While I dont agree that Katz is as neutral a source as you claim Im usually not one to advocate censorship on Wikipedia However you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point ie showing your sourced POV that you want to convey without endless quotes from one rather biased source The problem I have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of antiPalestinian quotes that intentionally or not turn the article into a hate blog Again while I admit I dont agree with your analysis as I think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization I am NOT asking you to remove it What I am asking is that you make your point concisely neutrally ie provide the point of view in a neutral way if that makes sense and in an encyclopedic manner Endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material There are much better proper and neutral ways to make your point Thanks  talk 

ps I noticed a new article Western Wall Tunnel in which you used a Haaretz article by Akiva Eldar as proof that Arafat incited riots That article says nothing of the sort and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as evidence that Arafat was trying to get out of a dead end It would be helpful to make that small section both accurate and NPOV Thanks  talk
