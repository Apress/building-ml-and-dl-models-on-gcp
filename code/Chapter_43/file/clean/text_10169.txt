Guys sorry for any trouble I caused I just started using my Wikipedia account recently When I read about the secret mailing list fiasco I wanted to know the truth so not knowing that it was decided for whatever reason to stop pestering Durova with questions I asked a simple question which I did not intend to be a personal attack Sorry if it was taken that way
PS I remember someone I believe it was Neil citing my message on an anons talk page against me because of my comment Im looking into your identity Theres a misunderstanding here I used to write for a school newspaper and I was doing research on a school computer not logged in I found that the IP of the computer I was using had done some bad edits in the past I decided to write an article about it and also attempt to find who was vandalizing the pages since it was someone at my school I never meant it as a stalkertype thing Sorry if it was taken that way
