What is your intention with this text as you give no reason why you are introducing this This is a talk page so you obviously have some intention to the mainspace text What is the aim
 Contentwise This seems to be a conspiracy theory that takes in a lot of wild allegations Combining these wild rumours in such a way is at best original research at worst slander Neither has a place in a mainspace article
