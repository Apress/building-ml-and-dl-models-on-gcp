Is there anything in FAassessment that specifically requires or even encourages this method What is good for Islam should be good for Christianity makes sense but Ive never seen it explained just why it is good Im not sure I buy easier flow but that might be personal preference And if people added cruft onto a glaring criticism section that will be dealt with quicklyenough on such a highprofile article as this But if there is a policyguideline in assessment that prefers the integrated method Ill be won over immediately
