In reference to the formula 11  2 you posted on my talk page as being proof of addition by subtraction Fine in theory as I have yet to see 1 of anything but I can prove that nothing is gained in your equation  
Observe

AB

Multiply both sides by A and you get

A2AB

Add A2 to both sides to get

A2A2A2AB

Using addition we get

2A2A2AB

Subtract 2AB from both sides

2A22ABA2AB2AB

Thus

2A22ABA2AB

Combining terms on the LHS

2A2AB A2AB

Divide both sides by  A2AB

2A2ABA2AB A2ABA2AB

Cancel out like terms and Viola  We now see

2  1

So nothing is gained from addition by subtraction
