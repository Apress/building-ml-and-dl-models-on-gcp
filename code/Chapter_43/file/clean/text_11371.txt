Category Wikiproject London Transport 

 You removed the Category Wikiproject London Transport tag from this article But I think we should keep it  the Transport section in the article contains information about Twickenham Garage coded AB including its location and that the fact that the relevant destination blind on buses for garage journeys there always referred to it as Richmond Bridge I dont believe this information is included elsewhere on Wikipedia
