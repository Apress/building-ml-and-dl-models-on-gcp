hi Cristiano Ronaldo 
          
        I know you play for Man United but I mean you dont deserve to be treated like that so why dont you go play for one of the teams in Portugal At least you will be treated the way you should be I may not be portugese Im americanbut my whole family was born in Portugal except for me and my cousins but we speak portuguese Anyway Im a big fan of Benifica and Portugal I dont care for the american teams or when America plays cause all I want for Portugal to winYou should play for Benifica maybe they might be champs if you play for there team
