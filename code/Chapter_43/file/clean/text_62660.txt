Amirite Article 

Hi Greg Jack

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases This one for example is certainly not a paid release httpwwwmakeuseofcomtagshareopinionsonlineamiritenetamirite Makeuseof is a very well known site httpenwikipediaorgwikiMakeUseOf

I dont think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesnt mention adversarial on it Also Amirites twitter has over 62000 followers which is significant httpstwittercomamiritecom And if you type Amiritecom and Amiritenet into google this brings more than 5 million results This is significant

Is there any chance you might reconsider your vote since this is my first article and it would be a shame to have it deleted especially sinc I really hope it isnt since Im a big fan of Amirite

Best Regards
