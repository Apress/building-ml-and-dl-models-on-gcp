Fair use rationale for ImageCiaraTheEvolution Frontjpg

This file may be deleted
Thanks for uploading ImageCiaraTheEvolution Frontjpg I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use When you use a generic fair use tag such as fair use or fair use inarticle name you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale

If you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting Image from the dropdown box Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you
