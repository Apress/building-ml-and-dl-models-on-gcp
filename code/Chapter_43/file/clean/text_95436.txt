From WPBLP
Talk pages are used to make decisions about article contents Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted and even permanently removed oversighted if especially problematic telephone number libel etc  New material should generally be discussed in order to arrive at a consensus concerning relevance availability of sources and reliability of sources Repeated questionable claims with biographies of living persons issues not based on new evidence can generally be immediately deleted with a reference to where in the archive the prior consensus was reached

Also youve clearly violated WP3RR again by removing the hatnotes     talk
