Rants to policies 

Hi

I think that you should reformat UserShanesWhy tags are evilThe vandalism protection tags or at least the idea into some sort of proposal to reformat multiple distracting protection tags to less distracting corner icons for example redirecting  to  well probably move the later to the former for this case The corner icons work beautifully are much less distracting and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for

I fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary This is especially true when nonuser Wikipedia users read the articles which probably constitutes the majority of Wikipedia readers They probably dont care that they cant edit the article nor would they and of most concernthey may confuse the tag with the article content

Thanks
