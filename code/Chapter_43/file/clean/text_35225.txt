Ive completed the nomination for you but I would say that I would like it if you came to the AfD page at WikipediaArticles for deletionĀtmaprajñānanda Saraswati and gave a little more explanation of your nomination other than advertising The reason is that many feel that this isnt enough to warrant deletion as this can sometimes be easily fixed Itd be better if you were to come in and explain how you feel that the person doesnt pass notability guidelines for one reason or another per WPGNG such as the author not receiving a lot of indepth coverage in English or foreign language sources
