Hmmm I dont really agree with your comments  I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for

I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations  You clearly disagree with this perception  

I take your point that the HK adsorption isotherm isnt as popular as Langmuir  BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups  Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access  

I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately

Moreover if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other lower status equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge    

Regarding the text being written in a journal style format does it really matter as long as it communicates the workings of the equation
