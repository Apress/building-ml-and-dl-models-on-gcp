Weird discovery here while bopping around Youtube  The Squids were founded in 1989  they own the name  We are talking the LaTourSpatafora Squids from Chicago  It seems that EVERY garage band from California has used the name The Squids  at one time or another roughly since 2008 as far as I can tell  These are NOT Squids tribute or cover bands either  Maybe this is where the original confusion started  To research The Squids  please tag LaTour  Spatafora  and Chicago and i believe this will become crystal clear to anyone investigating The Squids  I find this humorous but Id bet that this slack in research is how The Squids may have been forced to merge with Latour after the original accusations of being a garage band  Dennis Brown might get a chuckle out of this too
