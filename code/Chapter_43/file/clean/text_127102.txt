Hello Seiko Im glad you want to cooperate I would to read your argumentbacked answer on Ukraines etymology But back to the collage I think Mazepa is too controversial also within Ukraine Unfortunately there are not as many prominent and important women to justify an equal represantation This would mean that other really notable people would fall out Ivan Sirko is an undisputedly hero in Ukraine Pulyui is a notable Western Ukrainian physicist Blokhins mother was Ukrainian Can you accept this collage I tried to construct it without any controversial figures like Bandera or Mazepa In exchange I ignored Brezhnev Kovpak and others
