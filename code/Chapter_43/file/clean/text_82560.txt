Please dont be so obtuse
Your recent edit to the New Zealand section of the horse article removed the names of Phar Lap and Tulloch When I restored those names in the edit previous to yours  my edit summary said Read two paragraphs above  The bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand with the export sale of horses That includes Tulloch and Phar Lap And yet you still reverted by eliminating those two horses leaving the edit summary Will it never end LOL You didnt give a reason for the revert All you did was disrupt wikipedia I have reverted to the version which includes Phar Lap and Tulloch who  are both products Trelawney Stud Retrieved on 30 April 2009of the New Zealand horse racing stud  industry Read the cites Where they later raced can never preclude them from being part of the NZ horse industry So please dont revert again
