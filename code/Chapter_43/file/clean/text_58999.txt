Hi

How did you get involved in this business with 

Jim1138 left an erroneous and damaging Edit Warring warning on my page

You can see what he did here In the History section he replaced an entirely duplicated section duplicating the content immediately above it He called it an Unexplained removal of content No content had been removed it had only been paragraphed  which he then duplication 

He was obviously in the wrong He obviously paid no attention to the content 

Then he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise and remove and erase it

It strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around

It is not a content issue it was bullying 

Can you remove and erase it I dont want it to be left to be used against me as already happened

Thank you
