UT Vols
Hi there Billvol I tend to cover southern football before the mid 30s As a fan of UF and one with many Vandy connections would you do me a favor of looking over some of the Vols players in case of bias or just plain ignorance or a need for more eyes when you get the chance Some examples are Buck Hatcher who seemingly played just about every position and A H Douglas who managed a hell of a punt Roscoe Word is one with a few conflicting tales whether he coached or played or both and when Thanks
