I have tried to proceed in a reasonable manner Clearly you are not reading my post Did I or did I not state that these are definitions from a Classical Chinese dictionary Have you bothered to look this character up in a proper Chinese dictionary You think the omission of being unsettled is intentional do you 
 I feel unable to continue a reasoned discussion when faced with such an attitude Uneducated argumentum ad ignorantiam Perhaps you need to read up on what argument from ignorance actually means
 You also dont seem to appreciate the verifiability issue relating to ancient Chinese pronunciations But you seem to simply refuse to appreciate any point that I raise So I shall stop trying Good day  Talk
