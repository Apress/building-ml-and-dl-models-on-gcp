Shmayo I already know the map from John Speed but this far away from being an evidence that the SuryoyeSuraye called themselves Assyrians or considered the ancient Assyrians as their ancestors The Deutschen dont call themselves Germans Germanen or Alemanes Alemannen in their native tongue and its not the first time that the word SuryoyeSuraye was mistranslated into Assyrian by outsidersmissionaries and colonists Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity The SyriacOrthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words Interestingly the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic languagedialect also Siryon or Loghtha SiryanoythaAramoytha which is a result of GreekChristian influence on the Arameans The word Suryoyo which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites Catholics or Melkites Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history Even if the word Suryoyo derives from Assyrian ot doesnt change the fact that the Arameans where also known by this name
