Id buy you a cookie if you took a stab at rewriting the page especially deleting or reimaging that beatable sextion  The article is very much a mishmash that has resulted from one agenda editors stuffing something in without considering how it effects everything else or how obscurely you you have to read something for it to be true  This article should be simplified with some history some definition the explanation that gaming refers to the business of offering gambling games for instance is very important and some short paragraphs that lead to main topic articles  It seems we do have a sense here that such a generalizedsimplifiedless contentiously worded article that refers to other articles where we deal with something in more depth is called for  Id rather  or someone else would take a stab at it but otherwise I could take a stab at this idea on the next week or so  UNLESS someone now wants to say we gotta have that beatable games section because a rewrite will be probably just a waste of time if more than one person wants to fanatically keep that section as it is
