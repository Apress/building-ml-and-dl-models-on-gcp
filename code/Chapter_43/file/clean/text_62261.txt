This discussion about the links is ridiculous  Ive looked at all the sites and I dont think ANY of them should really be on here  What do they add to the article anyway  If you feel you must have some links then why not have the official company link and maybe one of each pro and con to be fair  Seems theres fighting between owners of the con sites but it should NOT be done here The pinkins shears site looks like it was done by a 10yearold and is next to impossible to navigate It seemed like most agreed upyourcadilac was a better site to include here So lets put up the good links and then leave the section alone It is wrong for a site owner to keep posting her own link
