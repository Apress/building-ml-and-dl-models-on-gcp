Actually what we were referring to as the lead is the lead statement for the History section Sitush has himself mentioned here that Andre Wink is reliable and we both had reached consensus on Tej Ram Sharmas statements in our earlier discussions Now in his absence if you have any valid reason to remove reliably sourced content you are welcome to discuss In fact I have great faith on you as a logical and neutral editor Please note that Sitush could not come up with any counter opinion as evident from the above discussions It would be great if Sitush joins back the discussions But since he has not left any message therefore we have to move on Please go through the sources cited and let me know if you have any issues Thanks
