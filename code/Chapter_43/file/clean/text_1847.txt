SOCK PUPPETRY IS USING ANY ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER CONSIDERED SOCK PUPPETRY This site is a complete joke I cant even edit using a verifiable account without being accused of violating some concocted offense My address was censored because I was using an account which was apparently improperly named so I am now using one that IS properly named AFTER the probation period and that in and of itself is apparently an offense Logically what is going on is that I am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because I am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance What kind of site are you people trying to run here

 Its no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when its become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse I have continuously been censored for editing a biased article an article which is continuously edited by selfavowed marxists and antizionists the very same people whose POV the article unashamedly puts forward What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication but its quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid 

In short explain yourselves particularly Roland Rance who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with all without explaining why When you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility As it stands wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence
