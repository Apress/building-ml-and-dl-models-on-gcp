Overseas 

If you fill out I129F while overseas is it possible to submit it to the proper authorities I am confused as the stategov website states that we may not file it at USCIS or embassy while abroad And when sending the proper forms that require a filing fee do we send by cash check or what Ive also noticed that the amounts supposed to be paid tend to vary from page to page is this a tech issue or are they separate payments 11281197
