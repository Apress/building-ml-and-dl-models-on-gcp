Bangladeshi Cyclists
I notice you did a name change in the captioned article Since the article name is Bangladeshi Cyclists I would recommend that you discuss changing the name on the talkpage If there is consensus then perhaps the name of the article would need to be changed also However do not make a unilateral decision to change Consult other editors whove been involved in the article to get their feedback
