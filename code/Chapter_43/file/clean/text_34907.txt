i see you spotted your mistake 

Welcome to Wikipedia I am glad to see you are interested in discussing a topic However as a general rule talk pages such as  TalkAaron Porter are for discussion related to improving the article not general discussion about the topic If you have specific questions about certain topics consider visiting our reference desk and asking them there instead of on article talk pages Thank you  SummerPhD talk 

it was not general disscussion about a topic the event happened yesterday and someone was asking if it should be submitted maybe you should do a little research first before throwing warnings around
