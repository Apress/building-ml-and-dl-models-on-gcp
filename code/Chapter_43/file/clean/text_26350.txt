I didnt mean to come across like that but it makes sense to put older characters with a past brief storyline that returned say in the 2010s like Harmony Hamilton her 200506 storyline was very brief and she returned five years later in October 2011 and now has a bigger character and storyline I dont feel the need to change the name there was no issue with this for the past threefour months and I dont thik there has to be now do you see my reasoning I also understand that the general reader may not understand at first but if heshe reads the opening title properly they should get it  Talk
