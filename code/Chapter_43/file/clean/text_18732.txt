This article is about the monument not the place or the probably nutty mayor I havent read the book so I dont know what it is  about exactly It is not a monument for nazi collaborators It is To Estonian men who fought in 19401945 against Bolshevism and for the restoration of Estonian independence Whole Finland was a German ally During the time managing to keep the soviet forces out Should their monuments for Continuation war fallen be called monuments for nazi collaborators as well
