 you have removed important material from the article section Problem Description  You removed a statement that the equations to be solved are not equations for a hyperbola  Rather than state what you had done you gave the vague description removed contrarian remark  This was a terrible edit on your part because not only is it absolute truth that the equations to be solved are not equations for a hyperbola it is extremely important that the readers be told this fact  The reason for this is because there is much discussion relating to hyperbolas in the section which is quite likely to mislead the reader into believing that the equations to be solved are equations for a hyperbola  The fact that you only say removed contrarian remark indicates that you were very superficial in your thinking  It is therefore concluded that we do need a statement alerting readers to the fact that the equations to be solved are not equations for a hyperbola
