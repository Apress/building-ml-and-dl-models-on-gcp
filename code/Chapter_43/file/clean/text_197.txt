I dont at all propose that it should be transcribed as meÀên in this or any other article  If anything at all just a brief mention of the raising of TRAP and MOUTH in a prenasal environment would suffice  I just thought it was an American thing to raise  before nasals I do it myself but I often hear Aussies do it quite a bit as well and I dont hear English people do it at all  The only difference is that Americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it  
Im not really surprised you dont have a broad accent being a Wikipedian  Im not saying its not possible
Youre right I was just kind of thinking aloud
