poorva mimansa is atheistic  

poorva mimansa is more atheistic than both buddhism and 

jainism
 let us see jainism do not entertains concept of god and buddha 

remained his silence both for god and deities
Later buddhist rejected god but not deities jainism do believes 

in deities But in jainism these deities are not siddhas and can 

only bestow material gains In mahayana even god can be 

believed and in hinyana and even in therveda deities are not 

rejected although here not much importance is given That in 

buddhism deities are symbolic is modern interpretations or 

propaganda  a more traditional buddhist believes in the 

ontological existence of deities although deities are not so 

important in dhamma
In poorva mimansa the earliest document we have is Sabara 

Bhasya a commentary on mimansa sutra attributed to rishi 

jaimini Here only the ontological existence of deities is 

refuted when Sabara writes  the vedic gods are mere words 

and sounds  and there existence is not outside of vedas  No 

modern propaganda  no atheistic interpretations done as done to 

adwaita vedanta but the earliest resources itself is clear on its 

starke athiesm Later mimansak remains doubtful over deities and 

mimansak like Kumarila and Prabhakara wrote extensively to 

refute the concept of god but maintained silence over deities
In a nutshell Mimansa was more atheistic in origin over  buddhism 

and jainism Today Vedanta is more famous among vedics and 

i too find adwaita if i leave buddhism and jainism  more 

interesting than Mimansa not that mimansa is lesser than any 

other
