Addition of history 

As can be seen I have added a new history section for the Bank of Liverpool  previously there were just a few lines of intro I have taken it up to 1918 when the Bank acquired Martins Bank and became the Bank of Liverpool and Martins There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive

I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928 when the name was shortened to Martins and possibly beyond

How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated The name change to Martins is really a red herring  it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article One solution would be to have Martins pre1918 history as a selfcontained article with the Bank of Liverpool article continuing up to 1969
