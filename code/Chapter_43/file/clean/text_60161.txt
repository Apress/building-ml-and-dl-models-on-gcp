Not trying to be clever only factual On the relevant edit of Hamsuns obituary I added reference to the official translation of the edit I made Pls see talkpage Eisfbnore and Jezhotwells in conjunction editwarred and appearently solicited blocking and thus excluded the correct translation as main form I only held to the factually correct added refs and the combined undoings by Eisfnore and Jezhotwells made this appear as though I was initiator  incorrectly This was not a 3RR as info was added When two editors with up to 3RRs each join up to editwar a solitary user is unfairly outnumbered This can only be seen as manipulation against me as user with the intent to maintainintroduce biased info on Wikipedia I find this shameful but have neither time nor editingskills and knowledge of Wikipediaarcania to continue these efforts at defending Hamsuns reputation towards the Englishspeaking world against such persistent efforts at negatively biasing the impression of Hamsun The errors are winning Why isnt reason supported better on Wikipedia  As for admin attention I dont know what or who that is I have asked How many am I writing to with no answer I dont have time to deepreasearch Wikipedia just to defend this one correct word in Hamsuns obituary on Hitler Seems the rules you bring to bear should be presented before using them  like the rules or conventions about so much admin attention on your page Thats news to me now What is it
