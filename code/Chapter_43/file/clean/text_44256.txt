Hisher arguments against a very minor edit were specious first claiming copyvio where there was none and the preponderence of evidence would point against any such possibility then claiming two or three notable figures were unimportant in establishing the real cultural currency and frequency of the poemmeme whereas RedPen saw no reason at all to question the inclusion in the article of totally nonrelated figures personalities war criminals and former royalty who had been given coupons to receive some sort of ice cream for free the only connexion being the ice cream came from a shop which bore the same name as the poem which the entry nominally concerned There is clearly harrassment going on here for no good purpose only for maintaining a mediocre status quo and a fairly unreadable article on wikipedia
