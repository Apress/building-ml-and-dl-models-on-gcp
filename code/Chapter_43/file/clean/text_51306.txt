AS Roma
Hi im the guy who keeps readding the hooliganism section of the AS Roma page and youre the one who keeps deleting it I was wondering if we could converse here and attempt to find some kind of common ground through debate rather than the petty deletions and additions that are currently taking place Many thanks SG  Preceding unsigned comment added by 929151242   
First of all post new posts at the bottom Secondly I only redeleted it once and I said why Ive stated my case already and I think you should take this to the next level suggestly to some soccer project
