What you have found on TAROMs website are the possible flight combinations with departure point at OTP using TAROM flights PLUS some other airlines flights airlines that signed agreements with TAROM eg OTP  YUL  Bucharest OTP  Montreal Dorval route operated by TAROM on OTP  LHR London Heathrow one stop in London and Air Canadas LHR  YUL flight This cannot be counted as a TAROMs international destinaton because it is not a DIRECT Bucharest  Montreal flight and it is not operated by a TAROM aircraft on all its length On the other hand OTP  LHR Bucharest  London can be counted as an international destination for TAROM It is a direct flight operated by a TAROM aircraft
