Animated series edits by TMan
Look Tman you just dont seem to get it  This page Legends of the Dark Knight is about a COMIC BOOK series  You cannot simply use the Top Level Tag to create a confusing double entry on this page for a comic book series and ONE EPISODE OF A TV SHOW  Episodes of TV shows especially animated ones do not get their own wikior top level entry  I am content with there being a Notes section to point out this fact although your writeup is too long and unverified and POV on the subject and it should be shortened further Please wait for consensus now before changing it again Thoughts by others
