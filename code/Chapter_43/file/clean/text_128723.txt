Re Correlation and dependence article 

Hi again and well done for registering 

Regarding the link that you wereare wanting to add to the Correlation and dependence article I suggest the following i you could best make your points for inclusion on the articles talkdiscussion page so that others can comment  the edit summary and users talk pages are not good for this ii you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this links content that is an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under External links so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding interpretation iii if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say or a good way of looking at things then you could try to summarise restate these points within the article itself  again you could ask for opinionshelp on the articles talk page but there is really no reason why you shouldnt go ahead and add something My own opinion is that adding plain external links should be avoided once an article has substantial content A previous editor mentioned linkspam and while this link might not quite fit within that term the website itself didnt seem to have a lot of other content but I could be wrong and the substantiality of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate

If you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see WikipediaWikiProject Statistics There is certainly need for help in improving the understandability of all of the statistics articles so dont be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities
