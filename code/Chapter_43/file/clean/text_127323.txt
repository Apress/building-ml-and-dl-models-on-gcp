Reverting each others edits is a waste of time for both of us so I was happy with your suggestion of a truce but was disappointed when instead of trying to find a mutually acceptable version you just reverted my edits A quick pubmed search on TGDc01 reveals 18 papers related to the TGDc01 and the Diaton I suspect that a unbiased examination of all the literature would result in an article far more critical than any previous version I am happy to undertake this as you are making it extremely difficult to assume any good faith but instead have reverted the article to the compromise version that followed your suggestion of a truce Reverting this version will remove any doubt that you are intent on inserting a biased and distorted version of the article
