I would like to point out denouncing your faith regardless is taboo in Islam Christianity and Judaism religions  So if he were Muslim he would be denouncing his faith by saying he is Christian or vice versa  If in fact he is Muslim he would be not even be considered a true Muslim believer by his comments And if he is lying then chances are he is none of the above
