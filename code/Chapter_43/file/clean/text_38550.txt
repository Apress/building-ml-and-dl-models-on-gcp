Blaming infidelity for homosexuality 

She met Jack Dunphy then a dancer with the Littlefield company in 1937 They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphys service during World War II during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil Dunphy was devastated by the infidelity and blamed it for his change in sexual orientation He adopted a gay lifestyle became romantically involved with Truman Capote and he and McCracken were divorced in 1951 Dunphy remained Capotes partner until his death in 1984

Im skeptical of the statement that Dunphy simply chose to be gay after the affair  This sounds like sneaky POV pushing  For the most part the consensus is that people are born gay they dont choose it  I think the sources need to be looked at a bit closer here or at the very least properly attributed to the authors
