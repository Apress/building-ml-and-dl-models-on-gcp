Sources 

Im concerned that many of the sources seem to go back to press releases picked up by media we consider to be reliable sources I understand that eg the WSJ is unlikely to pick up a low grade corporation form a press pack so that lends credence to it but Id prefer to see sources that feel less primary Im in no doubt that the corporation has notability but verifying it seems to be a challenge
