This person has complained about me by email  I am sure that this person is trying to get me banned for being a sockpuppet  Well this person is correct  I have an alternate account that I have stopped using and I notified an neutral adminstrator of that intention  This alternate account made only 1520 edits none of them about Palin Alaska or any person but had to stop because it was the recipient of some incivility and accusations of being a sock  Another checkuser and two administrators discussed it and came to the same conclusion as me that I am not a sock  It was agreed that starting a new username was ok to clear my smeared name  Those events were very emotionally trying so I do not wish to go through that again  If that happens Wikipedia loses because it just chases people away
