How about an RFC then 

Can we try an RFC  Id like to start with a brief neutral statement of the question and have others here respond with one statement each link prior discussions if you like limited to 1000 words no rebuttals or arguments then wait for comments from others at least two days before any reactions  The neutral question would be Should the title of this article be Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia or Serbia under German Occupation or something else consider the prior talk sections above  I will not be making a statement myself but I may respond after two days or sooner if others decide not to respect the proposal  OK    
No An RFC while theres an RM going on Just list the RM on various noticeboards And an RfC for what exactly If someone wants to move the article  let him post an RM thats what its for Wed probably go through the whole annoying song and dance to no effect And wheres the sense in having an RM for a move to one title while posting an RfC of all things for a move to another title

Im sure Antidiskriminator  Co will jump at this since for them whatever you their perceived newfound ally  propose and I oppose must be a good thing But it makes no sense I certainly wont accept any title that has not been agreedupon in a proper RM whatever the outcome of the RfC  indeed if any Additionally an RfC may not be the most useful and effective means of DR here since the dispute is immensely complex obscure and thoroughly boggeddown in misleading rhetorical nonsense A vote onthefly would not be very helpful and would probably be drowned in farmoreknowledgeable retorts from longtime participants   talk
