I  merely posted a response to the userMartial75on my personal talk page and my reason for doing so was because he kept editing my page knowing I had told him to leave me alone So then you are telling me that freedom of speech does not on my own talk page which had no profanity or inappropriate language I am a lawyer and I hardly see how this is reasonable treat It seems to me that this site is run by a bunch of kids who enforce rules even when there has not been a legitimate violation I understand why I was blocked the first time but for this time I disagree wholeheartedly with the decision and find it an offensive and disappointing act by the moderator responsible

I officially demand that Martial75 post no response or further editing on my personal page and if he does so should be blocked by a moderator
