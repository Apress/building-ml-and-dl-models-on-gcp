But coincidence is  Read the article I referenced by Salmon he explains it very clearly it is accessibly on the Internet  And by the way I am still waiting for those page references from Nibley for the matches that you say are suppressed  If you cant give a reference then how do I know you are not exaggerating the parallels Nibley claims or even making them up  This whole debate goes away when you can give us the references required to establish the facts quotes and page numbers so we can cross check   

 Selective deletion 

Das I dont appreciate how you are selectively removing my words from the conversations I have posted on this page  it appears that you are deliberately trying to cast me in a bad light  If you are not comfortable with me posting here then we can move the discussion to my talk page  I never delete any posts there and the entire conversation can be preserved   
Once again you are trying to misconstrue my arguments by selectively deleting my posts here  I reverted them  if you want to remove the conversation then remove the whole thing please
