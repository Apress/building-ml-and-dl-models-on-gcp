I see that youre acting in good faith but unfortunately its not possible to agree with you in the AntiTurkism part Even just thinking of the killed civilians in EsenboÄŸa airport attack on 1982 is enough to say that who knows maybe they were all recognizing armenian genocide
Saying that ASALA was not antiturkish is like saying that Talat pasha was not antiarmenian but he was just against the armenians who might have wanted an independent armenian country on the Ottoman Armenia Eastern Anatolia
