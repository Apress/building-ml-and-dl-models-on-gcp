Then my response to you is the same as it was to  BLP by definition only applies to living people Kyle has been dead for two years So just like I told him BLP does not apply Also the sources I used all met WPRS and were both relevant and notable They also took up a very small part of the total article so the fact that you believe they were weighted heavily negative whatever that means would be irrelevant even if it were true In fact the Salon article quoted directly from Kyles own book So if there is any concern over negativity then attribute it to the author of the book  the subject himself But in an article that is rapidly taking on the form of a testimonial or some kind of tribute page those inclusions met WPBALANCE But more importantly the fact that you would not only defend Mongos edits but ignore his behavior  after you ignored the links I provided you  is surprising and disappointing It suggests that youre not as fairminded  or impartial  as you led me to believe 2602306BD61E0F0DC436AD08320410A
