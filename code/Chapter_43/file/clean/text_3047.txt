ReDennis Browns final warning 

I didnt mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant I didnt violate the final warning CurtisNaito did multiple times The exact wording of the warning was If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility bludgeons a discussion violates WPIDHT acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours At no point did I push the boundaries of civility bludgeon a discussion violate IDHT act in a disruptive manner on any talk page or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors CurtisNaito displayed the exact same kind of IDHT behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions and when told explicitly that he was violating Dennis Browns final warning he kept doing it

Your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual when nothing I had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning was an offtopic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened

I understand you dont like me but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly
