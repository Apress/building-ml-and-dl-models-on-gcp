Say what

I decide to check out the AfD articles not something I normally get involved in I come to an article for deletion A Course in Miracles book I look over it  I see its been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word cult thats being interpreted multiple ways Multiple editors are squabbling over whether UserSte4k is being POV for using it I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote Garrett I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change citing the dictionary etc I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work which you helpfully catch and fix

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article I explain my reasoning but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand If I had I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive I think its generally well written At the same time it screams out for about 200 fact tags Its not clear to me how reliable it is The book article by contrast is not as pretty and as the principal author herself more or less says reads like a US District Court decision Theres a reason judges decisions are not high literature and thats because theyre shooting for reliability and precision not memorable prose Theres considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article theres even discussion as to whether the word movement should be used It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse reliability so I vote merge and delete so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built

Now I wake up and I find that youve spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article It appears that one word cult and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy That or my one vote in the AfD process If you dont like my cult edit just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong

Then theres this message on my talk page
Im not originally from the US I was born in Kharkov In our country we beat liars and if one wants to eat they work The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth did research marked it with citations for verifiability refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isnt even worth quoting You should be ashamed to have your familiy members name on this medium  

What do I make of this Are you saying that Im a liar and should or would be beaten That I should be working harder to eat And whats this about my family

And as for Wikipedia being flawed it certainly is that It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material In fact if so many millions of people didnt use it Id say forget about it But the fact is Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday Every day more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia Every month Wikipedias Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search The fact that so many other sites such as answerscom mirror the content makes whats written in Wikipedia seem all the more reliable since to the undiscerning it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia

So like it or not Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance You can fume and I can fret but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge reliable or not That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedias growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic Woodstockian notion that information longs to be free or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest smart but very young editors on this project
