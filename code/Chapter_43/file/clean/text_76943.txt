Youre not trying to canvas are you Those entries are not quite enough to convince me you are so forget it However I will let you know that I put an RfCreli on the talk page to drum up interest so we might want to step away from personally notifying other editors lest it look like canvasing   
No I was not trying to canvas  As you can see from the list you made I began with the two editors who were already involved one of whom as you can see on my Talk page was until then quite hostile to me To get more people involved what could I do  since I did not know of the method that you have kindly used on the articles Talk page  but get some Talk links from my Talk page starting from the bottom the most recent  If you look at what they wrote you will see that not all of them have always been in agreement with me but I thought that in this matter the more the better  I felt sure that scarcely anyone would support the claim of the owner of the article to control the gateway to editing it  If one of those I contacted is the editor who has since attacked Sherurcij anonymously I was and am quite unaware of any previous conflict between him and Sherurcij
