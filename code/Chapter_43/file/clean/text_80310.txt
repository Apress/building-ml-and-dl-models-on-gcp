Lenin in England 

Following Lenins death many streets in the strongly socialist communist mining villages in the North East of England were changed to the names of Lenin and other communist leaders See httpmapsgooglecoukmapsfqhlenqDH96PAom1 or Chopwell Is this worthy of a mention in this article

I think that is very interesting and worth mentioning especially since England is a western country  

I agree It is interesting that those actions were taken It would be interesting to include the question of why

 errata note

Historical research especially after the fall of Communism opened the Communist achieves has shown many negative aspects of Lenins regime From the Black Book of Communism Using the Julian calender The October revolution was on October 25 The Communists started closing down independent newspaper and radio stations the day after p 54 On November 13 on order was sent out that all who were suspected being an enemy of the people should be imprisoned p 55 Starting in January 1918 war prisoners were being tortured and killed on a large scale p 6061 Starting in May food was being requisitioned from the peasants p 66 Also in May several workingclass demonstrations were bloodily suppressed p 68 There were around 110 peasants uprisings in July and August p 67 In June 1918 the Cheka already had 12000 members p 68  On the 9 and 10 of August Lenin sent out telegrams ordering mass executions deportations and concentration camps p 7273 Trotsky also supported starting concentration camps p 63 

After the assassination attempt on Lenin and the succesful assassination of Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky on the same day Lenin and the other Bolshevik leaders decided to respond with overwhelming force both as retribution and as a deterrent for any similar future attempts This led to the particularly intensive period of oppression called the Red Terror

In May 1919 there were 16000 people in labor camp based on the old Tsarist katorga labor camps in September 1921 there were more than 70000 p 80 There were large scale rapes of bourgeoisie women documented in 1920 p 105 In total 50000200000 summary executions of class enemies occurred during Lenin regime

During Russian Civil War Lenin started requisitioning supplies  from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production In retaliation  Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain The Cheka and the army  began by shooting hostages and ended by waging a second fullscale civil war against the peasantry The food requisitioning are documented on p 97 and p 120121 The war on the peasantry including the use of poison gas death camps and deportations are documented on p 9297 and p 116118 In 1920 Lenin ordered increased emphasis on the food requisitioning from the peasantry at the same time that the Cheka gave detailed reports about the large scale famine p 121 The long war and a drought in 1921 also contributed to the famine Finally Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid but later had most of the Russian members organizing the aid liquidated Foreign relief organizations suspended aid when it was revealed that the Soviet Union preferred to sell food abroad in order to get hard currency rather than feed its starving people Estimates on the deaths from this famine are between 3 and 10 million For comparison the worst crop failure of late tsarist Russia in 1892 caused 375000 to 400000 deaths 

As can be seen it is extremely wellreferenced However the communist supporters seems to be extremely afraid to let other know of this and immediately revert all attempts to insert it  

I have never heard of this before I highly recommend that you consult with a historian before publishing anything you read off of the internet Infact from what I learned in Western Civ the Red Army didnt kill peasants but they did consume much of their food soldiers eat first civilians second leading to peas
