Did you even read the source you provided The first section VERY SPECIFICALLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY states that he has degrees in mathematics philosophy and theology and has worked and taught in those fields Before landing the job at SBTS he was a Professor of Theology and Science Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Louisville Ky Like I said if you have any doubts youll have to take them up with Dembski himself Its his CV published on the page of the theological seminary at which he teaches and I see no reason to question its veracity As far as I know no one has ever questioned that he is a theologist He clearly discribes himself as a theologist in his own CV Can you provide any reliable sources that say he is NOT a theologist
