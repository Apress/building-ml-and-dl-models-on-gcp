Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James Im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film that is Im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article  See for example something like Roe v Wade  theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case  Even if you really consider Moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the Wikiequivalent of Godwins Law here note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be   Similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there   2019 5 Jul 2004 UTC
