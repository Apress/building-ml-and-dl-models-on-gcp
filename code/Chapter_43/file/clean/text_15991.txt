David I have a couple of questions regarding your last edit to Skenes glands Basically the article matched the given references better before your edit Did you work off of some other reference  0335 Jan 11 2003 UTC

Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like wiki lets you do this by clicking a link I used a variety of references obtained via Google which I did not list in the article I probably should have

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored In particular I believe that Skenes glands are not the same as the Gspot and are not located there However stimulation of the Gspot can cause female ejaculation which generates fluid from the Skenes glands among other tissues

By the way your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive
