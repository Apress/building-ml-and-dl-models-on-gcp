Sorry to resurrect this issue after a very long while however the example of rice perfectly illustrates my point the current Abdul Halim is a name page analagous to Rice surname As such it is a perfectly good page However in creating it you have removed the necessary and separate page which disambiguates between uses of the term Abdul Halim analagous to Rice disambiguation Abdul Halim disambiguation is currently a redirect to Abdul Halim which is not a disambiguation page as it does not follow the disambiguation guidelines I referred to above Also by placing the name page at Abdul Halim you give it the status of primary topic It is more likely that one of the other uses should be there or it should be the disambiguation page I suggest you correct your edits to be in line with current guidelines by moving the current Abdul Halim to Abdul Halim name and creating a new disambiguation page at Abdul Halim following the guidelines at WPD and MOSD You will need to do this for any other names you treated in this way Thank you
