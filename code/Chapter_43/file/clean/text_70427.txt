No it is not the same as the Fischer clock The Bronstein clock would already get closer as in byoyomi like in Bronstein but unlike Fischer one cannot save up time for the next move However byoyomi differs from both systems because the extra time is only received when the normal playing time has already been lost whereas the Fischer and Bronstein systems do it from the first move on
