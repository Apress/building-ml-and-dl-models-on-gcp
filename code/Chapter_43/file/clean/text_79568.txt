Policy does not prohibit users including both registered and anonymous users from removing comments from their own talk pages although archiving is preferred The removal of a warning is taken as evidence that the warning has been read by the user Deleted warnings can still be found in the page history Repeatedly replacing warnings does nothing but antagonize users and can encourage further disruption removal of template warnings is rarely an urgent or important matter and it is often best to simply let the matter rest if other disruption stops

I promise other distruption is stopped You wont hear from me again

Thanks
