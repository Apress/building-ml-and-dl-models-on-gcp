Last time I checked the page was unilaterally reverted back again to the original the one that doesnt even come close to an encyclopedic style And my viable references have once again disappeared into various edit histories According to policy I am supposed to revert again But it is a waste of my time to keep working on this article when all of my efforts have been deleted So I have not yet reverted but am hoping to get more feedback from other interested users
