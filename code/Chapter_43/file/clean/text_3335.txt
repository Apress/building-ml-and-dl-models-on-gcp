My actions are not disruptive Why youre saying this is way over reason to explain since Ive provided plenty of reliable sources I am not vandalizing and I tried to reach a resolution with the author Therefore YOU DO NOT know what youre talking about Youre in danger of being reevaluated by wiki if you continue to defend a sperson who clearly is too stubborn to work with others on wiki and who deletes VERY reliable sources Such action speaks little about you as a wiki volunteer I urge that you to cease defending this person for whatever personal reasons you may have and be a true wiki volunteer Otherwise Ill be forced to request that wiki block you and I would not want that and neither do you
