Macedonian culture ethnic group 

I moved Macedonian culture Slavic to Macedonian culture ethnic group because of the following reasons
 It follows the same consistency with other Macedonian related pages such as Macedonians ethnic group
 Macedonian culture is not purely Slavic as it is a mix of Byzantine Slavic and Ottoman
 Macedonians dont identify as being an ethnic Slavic and I dont believe such an ethnic group exists in our present day
