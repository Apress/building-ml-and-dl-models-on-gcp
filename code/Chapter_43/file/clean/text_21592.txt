Dear Sniperz11 Thanks for your help advice We shall try our best to bring Brahmo upto acceptable wiki standards Please keep checking that page every 2 days or so and post on the Talk page there Actually there is a distinction between Brahmos and Brahmo Samaj Brahmos refers to adherents members of the Brahmo Religion whereas Brahmo Samaj refers to followers of the Brahmo Samaj qv Hindu Code 1955 So whereas all Brahmos are Brahmo Samajis the reverse is not necessarily true and which is why Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places However this has nothing to do with the BrahMos missile and I foresee a disambigunation page for Brahmos sometime in the future Cheers  

Dear Bikash
We have to improve the content on the page Add infoboxes images and citations Then we have to check all those spelling and grammatical things After that we have to find associated Brahmo type pages and add links from those pages to this article so that interested people can start editing this page Sniperz11 point about Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj commonalities  differences has to be brought out so the pages are not merged Bikash please create a wiki user identity
