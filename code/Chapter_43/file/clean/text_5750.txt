Title of article in English wikipedia 

This morning a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full Vietnamese diacritics  I just moved it back to the version without diacritics for the following reasons
 this is the Englishlanguage article about Ngo and the great majority of English text written about Ngo and other Vietnamese generally do not include diacritics  In English in fact inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect at best or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard English orthography  Please note I am by no means an Englishlanguage bigot I am a student of the Vietnamese language and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in Vietnamese  However it is clear that in English the diacritics play no role in pronunciation
 The Wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in English is the form that should be used
