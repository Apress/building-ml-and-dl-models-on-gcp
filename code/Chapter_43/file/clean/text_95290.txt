Hi 

Hey brownaddictUK welcome to wikipedia Ive noticed that you put the wwwhelpingaddictsnet link on a couple of pages that I watch over and wanted to give you a quick heads up on editing wikipedia  as youve probably noticed a lot of the links were pretty quickly removed by editors because this isnt the place for them  Im all for harm minimisation  abstaining from addictions but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects  To put a link to an external link to a website it has to have some further specific information about a subject or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article  The website you added doesnt fit either of these categories

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia judging by the list of articles you added the link to you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues maybe you could share that by contributing to articles

 If you need help on how to name new articles look at Naming Conventions and for help on formatting the pages visit the Manual of Style If you need general help look at Help and the FAQ and if you cant find your answer there check the Village pump for Wikipedia related questions or the Reference Desk for general questions  Theres still more help at the Tutorial and the Policy Library  Also dont forget to visit the Community Portal
