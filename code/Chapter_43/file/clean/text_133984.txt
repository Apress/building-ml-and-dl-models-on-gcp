But NONE of them are for lanesplitting There are none xero nada zip zilch NO laws in California against lanesplitting The fact that a chippy can cite you for unsafe speed reckless driving whatever does NOT have anything to do with lanesplitting It means you are guilty of breaking some OTHER law but they cannot give you a ticket for lanesplitting becasue it IS NOT ILLEGAL 

 And it doesnt matter what Pat honey has to say his claim that this is a grey area is patently WRONG If you want to take his word over that of the DMV and CHP then you are less than analytically astute 

 THEREFORE ergo whatever this section DOES NOT BELONG in that article because what it says IS A LIE Driving unsafely  lanesplitting can you figure that out  

 Unless you think wikipedia should be full of lies because someone you approve of says so  Sun rotates around the earth eh  The Church tried that several times I thought wikipedia was supposed to be about fact  

 I am now going back to get rid of that section because IT IS A LIE Lanesplitting IS NOT A GREY AREA in California according to the State of California 

 The State of California is a higher authority on their own laws than Patty Hahn sorry 2102214282
