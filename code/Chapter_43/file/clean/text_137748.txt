Hey I meant to thank you for your stance but I guess I was carried away downstream while being called a dick a harasser and what not Mast there is a problem with excessive deletions A huge problem And Im afraid its largely fueled by people becoming increasingly hooked on that little endorphin kick they get as they blow away an image or article and when they talk down to and then ban those who get uppity in defense of same Its at epidemic proportions and I decided I had to get some attention for it Review my edits keeping in mind that the couple dozen edits involved in the creation polishing and sustaining of entire articles like my first Whitechapel is worth several hundreds or even thousands of janitorial edits Im no troll These people are treating me like one with very little serious discussion on their end and yes now that theyve lost it completely and have banned me theyre in for some serious scrutiny down the line
