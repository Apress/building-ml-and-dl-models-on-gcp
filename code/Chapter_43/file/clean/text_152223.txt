Episcopal High School 

Sorry about my addition I recognize that the drug use section was unneeded and I added that before I recieved your message But the section 
 TABRecently the reign of Episcopal has begun a slight decline The first sign of this was the new Episcopal code Episcopal students do not lie cheat steal or chew gum on campus This was taken to be a joke by many students but alas it was not Additionally several excellent teachers have left and recently one of most notable faculty Holocaust Historian John Iorii has been asked not to renew his contract These changes in the EHS experience began with the choice of former headmaster Charlie Zimmer to abdicate his title to Dale Regan When asked about Ms Regan one student was quoted as saying She seems to me to be a NeoFacist and she talks entirely too slow
is an actual even that is happening at the school This something that is just as worthy as being on the page as the noose section is If you do not think the line  
When asked about Ms Regan one student was quoted as saying She seems to me to be a NeoFacist and she talks entirely too slow
is uncalled for that is fine it can be removed if neccessary
