You have only accused me here and no explanation is given for Inserting report in bad light Do I need to compromise on Your POV to be Objective Never 
Your second link itself tells the whole story which says that Tuesdays violence comes in the aftermath of an incident on Sunday night when Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith Sindh Amir and MMA leader Mufti Muhammad Yousuf Kasuri was arrested under the Blasphemy Act
Your first link also says that they are regaining mosquesExperts believe that the bombers targeted Abbas Qadri Amir or supreme leader of the Sunni Tehreek a Barelvi organisation fighting since 1992 to regain mosques which it claims were usurped by the sects opponents Sunni Tehreek leaders claim to have seized at least 62 Deobandi and Salafi mosques between 1992 and 2002 in ways that have on occasion sparked violence

I have no Problem ever if complete truth is brought but You always bring what suits to You and this POV will not be there ok
MoreOver if these reports with full Version of truth are added on Barelwi page then Youhave to show same Objectivity there on Deobandi page where You feel uneasy when i tried to add Times Online link claiming that Deobandis are extremist and have wrested control of Barelwi Mosques
