Hi ChemNerd thanks for your positive response and your additional remarks regarding skeletal formulas terminate with CH3 rather than just the end of a line If one organic chemist like me is communicating with a colleague of the same profession the sketal formulae without an explicit CH3 is often preferred thats true However I want a broader audience to understand me especially if I write in an encyclopedia This is not only my personal taste please comment  on  WPCSDGGeneral bullets 5 and 6 Have a nice weekend Thank you
