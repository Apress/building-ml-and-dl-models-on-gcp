serRyulong disagreed with me on a substantive editing issue and is now throwing his weight around to continue taunting me Seeing how I feel posted clearly on my talk page there is no invitation for him to come here and harass me Just because I cannot seek help or intervention while Im blocked doesnt mean he should have the right to come and taunt me

No he disagreed with me on a substantive issue  Another administrator blocked me punitively on a substantive issue because that administrator supported the sources added to the article while I didnt to prevent me from protesting the second rate nonverifiable sources in an article

My talk page makes it clear how I feel about this issue

I am NOT attacking Ryulong on my talk page  I am Blocked  This is the only page I can post  All he has to do is stop posting here

And since he obviously did not read my talk page how dare anyone ask me to read what he has to say while Im not allowed to communicate 

While Im blocked for protesting citations according to Wikipedia policy
