StanZegel writes to CTSWyneken  An anonymous editor is like a sniper in a tree top taking pot shots at those trying to do serious work on the ground and dropping his waste matter into the work in progress Im not sure that anything such a person attempts to add is worth verifying but should be summarily deleted on the basis that a responsible person would identify himself If the material is truly worthy a responsible scholar will get around to adding it In the present case I believe we are dealing with a sock puppet for an editor who has been banned previously for similar activity and may be on probation right now If so that probation is being violated and keeping his edits or wasting time on his contributions simply enables continuing violations  talk
