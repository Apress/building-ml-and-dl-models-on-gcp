Article forking
With the new article you created you seem to be almost entirely using information from the vacuum aspiration article  Spinoff articles like your new article are usually only done when the main article in this case vacuum aspiration is very long  I dont know that that section is ready to be spun off into its own article yet  please read WikipediaContent forkingArticle spinouts  Summary style articles

I believe the best thing to do would be to add any new information you think is important into the vacuum aspiration article and change your new article Manual vacuum aspiration or MVA into a redirect to vacuum aspiration

Please let me know if you believe MVA is a sufficiently broad topic to need its own article  Otherwise I will go ahead and make the MVA article into a redirect Talk     C
