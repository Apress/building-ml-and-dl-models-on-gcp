Error
I have found an error with a physics article  This is even more clearcut  The editor got confused and wrote exactly the opposite of the correct equation  The new strategy would be to simply correct it and explain the correction on the talk page  If unblock I will do it  If not I obviously cant  Im not going to remember 72 hours to do it later  Ill just let it go
