More censorship  Is Kim part of the  East Anglia Global Warming cabal  Or a sympathiser  See here The above could just as well have been for personal attacks on another editor Please follow the rules for wikipedia or step away until youve calmed down enough to be able to do so Kim D Petersen talk  and note this link httpgroupsgooglecomgroupaltglobalwarmingbrowse_threadthreadd47e270e55141009hlen 

I see the makings of a conspiracy here  Is Kim one of Williams friends  Likely as she monitors the GW pages on Wiki  Anthropogenic global warming is real  But these hard core Greens want to hijack the debate about the effects of AGW  The IPCC itself has said the lower bound effect is likely a mere 5 cm rise in mean sea levels over the next 100 years  Nothing to worry about but the hard core Greens dont want us to know that  Further research is needed not action  I will be heard  Posting from Washington DC where I remain as a former lobbyist  Have a nice day  And no I dont care if you delete this passage or not this is for your consumption not for anybody else
