Theogolgy John you should be fair and warn the other parties i have been very civilJesus is not a pop star so i dont like the grouping further more he is famous in two faiths there is no arguing there I would warn against your civilities as they border on bigotry random useless adherence and it reflects poorly on a site which is discussing our blessed Jesus as i have said most of the world loves Jesus and 15 of the world is Muslim that is a lot of love show a worldview please Jesus is not property of one group And we are fully aware of the politics of Jesus being a Jew and we know it would be removed if added because of the tension in such assertions
