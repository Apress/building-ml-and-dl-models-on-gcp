Sorry mcd00b but the debate isnt even and fair because the Genesis side has the name without consensus per last rfc and it isnt stable because im here asking for an rfc and ask about once a year as do others and with their posts being censored and deleted then it clearly isnt even and fair sergecross thats the whole point there doesnt need to be a new approach or viewpoint presented peoples minds can change and consensus can change which is why having an rfc would be worth while 8019285232
