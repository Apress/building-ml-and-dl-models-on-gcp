Ice treaty
This caught my interest
According to a contract which had been signed Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price
Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudsons Bay Company which maintained a post at San Francisco though perhaps not this late their post was at Yerba Buena town and had been founded in 1830  The reason I propose the HBC is that there was a treaty  more than one  between the RAC and the HBC on the latters provisions of dairy and meat and vegetables to Russian America maybe there was a reciprocal agreement  I cant imagine what treaty the RACRussia would have had with the United States that could have signed between 1824 and 1859unless this has something to do with US support during the Crimean War  Or  If its a contract with a private company other than the HBC then treaty is not the right word to use  if its a corollary to the AngloRussian Convention of 1839 or the earlier arrangements with either the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company  or some grandfathered contract re the agreement with Mexico over Fort Ross somebody please explain
