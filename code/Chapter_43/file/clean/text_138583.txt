Note that in some cases it is a good idea to have a talk page be a redirect  Suppose that there were links to TalkSecond city with a lowercase c on various pages across the wiki  When TalkSecond city gets moved to TalkList of second cities it is usually a good idea to redirect the old talkpage so that those links will go to the right place  If the talk page were simply left blank people clicking onto it would be confused  There dont seem to be any such links currently however so that rationale doesnt really apply  I dont really have a firm opinion on this  I at first redirected it to talkSecond City but youre right that people would only go to talkSecond city if they had deliberately avoided following the redirect    TalkContributions
