Please tell me why you have deleted my entry  third time  

Hi Husond

Just wondering why after all the work I seem to be putting in to this article on filmmaker Matt Norman that it is continually deleted To be honest the typing up of this is killing me Its been deleted without any real notice three times Even though Wikipedia has clear need for this entry Please view how many links back to this entry and for a realistic purpose being a HISTORY event I actually feel that Wikipedia is not really that interested in History Is this the case If it is a biography then why is there literally hundreds of others on Wikipedia with biographys It seems to be being targeted Can you please tell me why that is so 

I have contacted Matt Norman the filmmaker as I got the information from him I have also spoken to him about the deletion of this article and he has said you can contact him direct on infotheactorscafecom in relation to this matter 

Can you please tell me why exactly is it continually being deleted when all this work has gone into the article Please also tell me how exactly you believe it should be written so that it doesnt get deleted Please

Thanks in advance
