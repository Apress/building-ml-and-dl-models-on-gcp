Im not the one who added that source neither had I actually read it before hand On the subject of that you or any other Cradle fan made  that sounds fairly ridiculous as you could just as well say that about any topic on Wikipedia Im not arguing this because I think theres a source that was added that proves it it seems to be fairly obvious as the only difference was the back ground at one point there was a picture of the original on Wikipedia which was linked from this article but it got deleted Its like saying that the Sigil of Baphomet requires a source to say it was based off a pentagram
