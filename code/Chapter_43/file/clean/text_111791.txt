Sons of Ali alHadi Imam Ali Naqi
There is no conclusion over three sons or seven  Why it is considered necessary to place a full stop after mentioning three sons  Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of reference being emphasized with the availability of an ISBN  and its publishing in English language by a foreign expert his dignity is recognized but critical view is our right  In my discussion  Abu Mikhnaf is one of primary sources per norm of social science history

 Primary sources relate to an event written by someone who experienced or witnessed the event in question by  letters memoirs journals speeches manuscripts etc

Secondary sources function to interpret primary sources  Secondary sources interpret to assign value and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources
 
When evaluating primary or secondary sources the very basis warrants to know
iHow does the author know these details
ii Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene 
iii Where does this information come from ie personal experience eyewitness or reports written by others

Thus the reliability of an scholar Wilferd Madelung  belonging to a belated period 20th century depending on single source of tenth century does not sense to overrule the very old primary source of 8th century  which is not only supported by millions of naqvisnaqavis  of the world particularly the subcontinent but also evident from the various published secondary sources eg GulzareNaqi Riaz ulnasab compiled with the help of 38 books annexing 40 pedigrees by a family member of Ali Naqi Naqvi   The writer belongs to well educated family his two elder brothers were college principals in colleges of  Punjab  Among his brothers Dr Sohail Bukhari was an authority in Urdu Literature  in his time besides being an author for Punjab Text Books for school and colleges

In view of above discussion the section which provides explanation to the confusion in numbering and names of sons should remain in the main article for research and reference in terms of ENWP being  the tertiary source
