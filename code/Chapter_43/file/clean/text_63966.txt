I agree with pm_shef lets celebrate we agree on something Mario Raccos name should stay up on here the fact of the matter is he filed nomination papers and then withdrawn  I would like to put up an explanation why he did this but we do need some reference It is speculative why he did this although I again agree with pm_shef when he made the assumption it was to draw funds out of his municipal campaign fund which seems like a reasonable reason to me  I dont know what the laws are on putting your name in for nomination while holding other office  But this now seems to be a common practice here in Vaughan for example Alan Shefman put his name in to run municipally in 2004 byelection Councillor while still holding another municipally elected position school trustee Susan Kadis did a similar thing in 2004 as well running federally while still holding municipal office and Racco also did it in 2003 when he ran provincially while still holding municipal office  I do have to say this practice may be legal but I see it as unethical  The most ethical way for candidates to deal with this situation is what Oliva Chow did in Toronto she actually resigned her municipal councillor position prior to running for federal office
