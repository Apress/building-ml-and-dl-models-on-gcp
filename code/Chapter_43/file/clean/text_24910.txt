I noticed you added criticism of Press TV from this article  

The article however goes on to say Only five days after launching Press TV invited me to take part in a televised panel discussion about journalism in the Middle East I argued that the biggest challenge facing journalists in the region is a lack of freedom and cited among other examples the case of Zahra Kazemi the Canadian photojournalist who was raped tortured and murdered by Iranian officials after she was arrested for taking photographs outside the Evin prison in Tehran To his credit the host and chief press officer Shahab Mossavat did not interrupt or silence me He called my comments offensive to Iran but pointed out that I was given free rein to say what I wished by Press TV He then steered the conversation toward obstacles confronted by journalists in Israel Thus the author demonstrates that Press TV let him criticize the Iranian government If were going to add the critical parts of an article shouldnt we add one sentence about the positive elements of the article too What do you think Im going to move this to the articles talk page since its easier to talk there
