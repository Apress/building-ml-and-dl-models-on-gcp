Re Qazakh
Dear Khoikhoi thanks for your mediation effort on this one I agree to the general spirit of text you posted But I would like to hightlight some correctionsadditions which I highlighted in bold below
1 Under the Russian Empire the rayon was an northeastern part of the Kazakh uyezd of the Elisavetpol guberniya
2 UserAivazovsky needs to cite the references where he got the figures 39 Armenians and 57 Azerbaijanis from
3 This sentence does not reflect the historical reality
After the British left and more fighting between Armenians and Azeris ensued Bolshevik forces gained control of the region and annexed it to the Soviet Union
Britons have left Caucasus in 1919 while Bolsheviks took over Azerbaijan first in Caucasus on April 28 1920 Armenia was taken by Bolsheviks in November 1920 Soviet Union was created in 1922 So obviously Bosheviks could not have annexed it to the Soviet Union Kazakh uyezd was part of Azerbaijan Elisavetpol governorate was designated so by Britons which under Bolshevik rule was divided between Armenia and Azerbaijan
4 Neither country has disputed this boundary since quote is not true Armenia occupied one of the exclaves of Kazakh rayon called Yuxari Askipara during 19911994 active phase of war
