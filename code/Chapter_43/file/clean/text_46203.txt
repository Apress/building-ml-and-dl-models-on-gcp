A lot of the history i have been adding Unfortunatly has not been written about a lot of it was part of my own personal research The Latino history of Oakland has been ignored by Historians so very little is written about it but what i have added is very true and is just as much a part of Oaklands history so im sorry if i dont have links to articles written about this history but i will look for some so you Racist can stop erasing what i write
