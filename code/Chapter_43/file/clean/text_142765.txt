Hi Doctormatt perhaps we could say that a derivative is the rate of change of a function or quantity at a certain time  That seems fairly unequivocal and much more accessible than what is currently there  Im not so much a proponent of my own version so much as an opponent of the use of the meaningless to the nonmathematical word instantaneous

I dont really mind the differentiation thing being right after the initial sentence because people might have clicked on the derivative page after going to differentiation a disambig page  Its certainly grammatical to say Finding a derivative is called differentiation see gerund  However now that I think about it maybe we should just say Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative  We put the sentence in the active voice
