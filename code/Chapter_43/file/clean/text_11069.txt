Rogue Editor 

Hello Xenoi am having a bit of a problem with User talkItsAlwaysLupusi had notified him a while back about a unsourced statementDuring the late 1980s house music followed and replaced postdisco in the music scene on this article PostDisco and  i removed it under WPPROVEIT and he keeps restoring it without a source and trying to bait me into an edit wari mean he really shows no want to resolve this problemhe is even stalking my edits and reverting my edits i have made at other random articles like here  and on his reverts on the post disco page he keeps calling me a vandal and such i did a couple of reverts of his past edits just as a shot off the bowthat we can both do that but it is not going to get us  no wherei have left warnings but he just puts them right back on my pageso before this escalates any further i suggest a ADMIN steps in at any capacity on neutral ground to clarify policy
