CATAssyrian stubs
I think you should calm down with deleting the Assyrianstub from every Assyrian person just because you in all your ignorance consider them not notable Youre not an expert on every Assyrian and you dont now whether theyre notable or not For instance Sargis Bkheera is indeed a very notable Assyrian and his Wikipedia entry is as of now a stub Hence the Assyrian stub in his case is just fine By the way the Assyrian flag is much more contemporary to the Assyrian nation at the moment than Ashurbanipal Talk 2021 14 Jun 2007 UTC
