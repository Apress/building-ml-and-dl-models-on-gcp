Edits on Bombardier CSeries page 

Dear Tagremover
thank You for Your edits on the Bombardier CSeries page I trust they were performed on good faith
Although I would like to tell You that the reference You used Bombardier CSeries Factsheet is an old brochure from January 2009 Also the French and Japanese articles on the Bombardier CSeries are outdated and still list the ER versions of the aircraft
During 2012 Bombardier removed all references to the ER and XT versions from their factsheets this was discussed on the articles discussion page and a revision was promptly made to the section in the article with this edit dated December 18 2012
Furthermore in March 2013 Bombardier revised several key data like aircrafts dimensions and performance data and I performed a full review of the specifications section in the articles page with this edit dated March 8 2013
Thank You for Your understanding
