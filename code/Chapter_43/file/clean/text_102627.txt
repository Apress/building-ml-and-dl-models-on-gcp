gija edits 

according to WPNPOV the majority view should be referenced to commonly accepted reference texts i cant find any english reference texts that discuss this detail but the most reputable koreanlanguage encyclopedias clearly show the korean scholarship consensus    the theory that gija joseon was a separate entity adjacent gojoseon is described if at all as a minority view  describes in detail that the consensus today is that gija was likely a real figure in chinese history but his connection to ancient joseon was a later embellishment given treatments like  it seems to me we need less on gija joseon in this summary article and more on the details of various current theories in the gija joseon article of course if there are english sources that indicate that the current scholarly consensus is something else id love to see them
