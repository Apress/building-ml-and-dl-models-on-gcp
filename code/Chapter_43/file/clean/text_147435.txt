No it was not ever part of her offical style You can go the the London Gazette and search for her and view the various forms that she was offically known by during her life none of which was ever Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom By your view The Princess Royal could be Princess Anne of the United Kingdom which is not now nor has it ever been part of her offical title 

Im not really bothered by not being able to edit while signed in It isnt causing any problems 

BTW if you are going to continually change the citation I have provided to an acutal source concerning the surname then you need to either leave off your citation or have to go to an actual reference A statement written by you is not reference it isnt even verifiable and is against wiki conventions You are doing the very thing that you seem to be upset about other people doing You statement is actually incorrect Its worded to matter of factly and implies that it is a fact when it is not It doesnt even agree with the Letters Patent and Royal Warrants and I have repeatedly pointed out to you where you can find the full text of each 

Additionally you should see either Burkes Blacks or Debretts for the correct usage of Dowager The term queen dowager actually made more sense in the article about Queen Alexandra than does Queen Mother and the sentence worked just fine  0821
