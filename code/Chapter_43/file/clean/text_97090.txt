Yes but how did they teach her language How did they teach her what the letter A was or that there are other languages such as french and latin I have no clue how she would be able to grasp ideas like letters or political philosophies she was a socialist and so forth When i have asked this question all i hear from people is that her teacher worked with her and employed many methods then she was able to rad and write in several languages and was very accomplished But how she would have no background or understanding of what anything isboth physical things in the world and empirical matters I understand that she laerned what water was ok easy enough But how do you teach the word the let alone socialism or even basic sentence structure
