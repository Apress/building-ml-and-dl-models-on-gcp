You appear to be asserting ownership  I removed some material and adjusted some other material due to lack of independent evidence of significance  Please find references from outside of the walled garden of the Seagrave conspiracy theories  In particular please show evidence of discussion of the supposed CIA link in independent reliable sources  discussion in major national and historical journals for example  Right now you are supporting several historians being in support of this theory but all that is evident to the disinterested observer I have no history here and am not American is an amusing conspiracy theory promoted by two people who happen to be historians  There is no evidence of proper historical rigour and no evidence of peerreview through journal or textbook publications  This applies particularly to the 2002 court finding where you draw directly on primary sources without the benefit of analysis in reliable secondary sources  Please see WPATT WPV WPRS Guy
