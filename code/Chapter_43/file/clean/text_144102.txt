TemplateCalcio Eintracht on itwiki

Hi Lemmy Theres nothing personal against that eagle I simply reverted that template because of a decision taken by some users and I am one of them who are trying to simplify the little flags to improve their graphic appearence So its not a matter of copyrights we just think that eagle appears not so clear at a 20px widht We have lately modified a number of template for the same reason or because the flags were judget not appropriate for the shades of the colours for the complicated drawings there were on them or simply for the history and the traditions of the club I hope my english is good enough to make you understand what I mean Bye  Murray 933820945
