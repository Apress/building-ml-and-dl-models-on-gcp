Alright I said this before but apparently you did not absorb what I had stated I would do pursuant to wikis policy so I will restate it here YET AGAIN I will provide the sources upon which the info I will present is based I have said this more than 4 times so far Didnt you read that in my posts to you With all due respect I dont understand why you contradict me when I am agreeing with you in accordance to wikis reliable source policy to which I will adhere 

Secondly I never found ALL CAPS to be uncivil and against wikis terms Is it part of wikis terms If it is then you should provide a reliable source to confirm that statement
