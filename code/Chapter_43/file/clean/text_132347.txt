Richard the Lionheart and Sex 

You seem like a fair guy so I was wondering if you could help resolve the tiff between Silverwhistle and I on Richards sexuality I think the problem is that my edits make the straight theory seem bigoted and that Silverwhistles make the gay theory seem liberal and fantastical I was thinking we could pour all our arguments into a new section marked Sexual Orientation Would you support this and help us How can we resolve this without venom
