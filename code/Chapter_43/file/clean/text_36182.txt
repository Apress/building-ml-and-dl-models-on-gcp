Why NJGW



the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an antiIsrael and antiUS policy connected to the Yom Kippur war  

Yet as we now know the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against Americas allies in Western Europe and Japan And another dimension of the Nixon administrations policy on oil price rises was to give a new role through them to the US private banks in international financial relations

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar But according to the Nixons Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time the principal political objective behind Nixons drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs 

Nevertheless  Nixons officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its allies in the IMF over socalled international monetary reform was brilliant

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors

At the same time the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared So the socalled petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to nonoilproducing states

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF  But the US rejected this insisting  the Atlantic worlds private banks at that time led by American banks should be the recycling vehicles And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf it could get its way
