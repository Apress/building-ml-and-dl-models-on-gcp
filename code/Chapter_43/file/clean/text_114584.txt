Discussion about this 

The pages starts with Since Commons is a repository for free images that can be used across wiki and crossproject wikipedia should move all its Free images to commons  some people would dispute this or rather would dispute the deletion of the Wikipedia image Was there a wide discussion of this bot and how it should operate Could you link to that discussion from the top of the page  
the content of the page is a personal essay and a simple description of what the bot does It its been wikipedias policy to delete images once they are on commons My goal is to get images that should be on commons on commons if enwikipedia wants to keep a local copy then that is up to them Î²command
