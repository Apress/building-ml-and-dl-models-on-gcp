Ambiguous phrase 

Wilson initially suggested Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler whom Glass outright rejected
This phrase is unclear did Glass reject both Chaplin and Hitler or only Hitler The latter seems very logical to me  I wouldnt want to compose an opera about Hitler either On the other hand Glass obviously didnt write an opera on both So anyone
