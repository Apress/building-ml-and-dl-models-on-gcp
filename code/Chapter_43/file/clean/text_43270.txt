The Lost Trailers 

I am new to Wikipedia I am only here because Stokes Nielson of The Lost Trailers is concerned that the Wikipedia page for his music is inacurate The Lost Trailers existed before the commercial prominence of the band and it continues to exist today This is why we are trying to update teh Wikipedia material Yes I am his publicist but were not trying to advance any agenda other than to make the information about this ongoing project like Broken Social Scene correct There were players before those who had commercial success and there are different players today laughingpenguin
