Farce 

You can criticize policy all you want What you cant do is turn a policy discussion page into a soapboxing rant We cant fix Magnotta Assuming the murders would not have happened if we gave him his 15 minutes of fame is ludicrous on its very premise By that argument Jodie Foster should have dated John Hinckley Jr so he wouldnt have attempted to assassinate the President Its a complete farce of an argument  Bite
