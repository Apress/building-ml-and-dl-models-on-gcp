joshbuddy your editing leaves me gasping Your Leadin is not only void of verification it also presents several outright false statements and seriously misrepresents other items 

1 The statement that Jehovahs Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole is grossly misleading because all Jehovahs Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do Hence this statement of yours misrepresents 

2 The statement This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford not only lacks verification it is just plain false Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred and he never condemned blood transfusion 

3 The statement Beginning in 1980 the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible is not verified and it is just plain false Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961 which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence 

4 The statement there is evidence that some Jehovahs Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions is a patent misrepresentation Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovahs Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion 

5 The statement The nonacceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovahs Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine is another horrible misconstruction When it comes to the Watchtower organizations blood doctrine there is no other similar group and you have not referenced one either 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject You manifest ignorance of the subject and a willingness to edit despite that lack Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction which feeds nicely into the article as a whole 

You have yet to answer questions asked of you in relation to the verified Leadin language will you ever
