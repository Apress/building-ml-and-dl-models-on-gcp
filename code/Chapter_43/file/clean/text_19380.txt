I usually just put that some matter received a great deal of publicity provide some references  and let it go at that For instance in the Doris Kearns Goodwin article there are 14 articles railing about her plagiarism many  years after the fact None of them get quoted and exist merely to support the assert that the issue received a lot of publicity because none of them provides new information
