Hoovers murder investigation re Kennedy 

The information about Hoovers role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well documented

Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F Kennedy which is often called the Crime of the Century The first citation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy   The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies 

The second citation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show It was reviewing the official government records that electrified top Washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure The once secret documents are fascinating especially as reviewed by PBS  

Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedys murder The former Attorney General was grilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedys assassination The copy of his memo is carried by Lancer  If the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report 
President Johnson along with Hoover also knew about the Oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a hit man   Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him I dont know what it would be 

There is no question the FBI under Hoover acted as the primary investigative arm of the Warren Commission and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing
 I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy   The testimony is unsealed now

There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence They were caught and its now public knowledge There is a full pulic record The agent involved even wrote a book about it    

The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide  This is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes 

 Conclusion

Therefore any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in One should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesnt like it If that were the criteria for deleting information then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country Nothing negative can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a theory No the information is documented by reputable sources

What I cant figure out is why Mr Hoovers sexual life gets so much space and yet someone doesnt want information on Hoovers job performance on the biggest case of Hoovers career
