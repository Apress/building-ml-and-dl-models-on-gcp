Surviving in Frankenwiki
Okay Im back from my latest 24hour persecution and I realize how the mediation request merely subjected the article to more Thought police rather than encouraging civilized solutions to problems  My mind is spinning in 100 directions I really dread any continued judgment by a jury of sneers so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type Some articles become hopeless chaos when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic Harry Potter what One of the worst hatchet jobs to any article was with Search engine where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for stuff and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA fingerprints or luminol of Italian fruit juice It was another case of too many kooks spoil the broth and hence that implies a longterm issue articles need a limited roster of active editors to limit meddling perhaps have an active count and when a editor abandons an article then space opens for another editor to join the roster The current myth that 500 people can be allowed to adjust an article is what led to the Search engine article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text Again it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop versus when they are wasting their expertise in mudpit articles It might be much better to develop 100 rarelytrampled articles rather than fight a POVstampede within a single article Plus it is unsettling to realize theyre reading every word of your talkpage and plotting the next insult I could not in good conscience join in a forum associating with haters because it is agreeing to make a pact with the devil Wikid77
