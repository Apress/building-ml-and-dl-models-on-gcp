The administrators exercise very little if any editorial influence over wikipedia  They have only intervened in a small number of cases for example they have never had any influence over the editing of this article

Nevertheless wikipedia is not an example of spontaneous order  What is spontaneous about it  It is not like a market where for example a complex highlyefficient supply chain might arise without any individual even being aware of it let alone designing it  On the contrary wikipedia demonstrates no organization that has not been explicitly specified by some human editor  Moreover where is the order to it  It is a random hyperlinked jumble as it should be  Its only order is that it is separated into articles with titles but that is hardly an order worth noting

Perhaps it is the actual content of articles that is supposed to exhibit spontaneous order but again I do not see how  Every wikipedian adds his little piece and the total is the sum of the parts  Spontaneous order only occurs when something more emerges
