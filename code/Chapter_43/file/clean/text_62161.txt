reEdit warring 

First off i am well aware of policy buat as is the case with you self any most admins you fail to to eith have done your reasearch fully or to find out exactly what is going on but instead have decided to inject the defacto and unwritten policy of appeasment which for an encyclopedia is unacceptable As for the useres action i do take them as vandalism under the provisons of Childish vandalism in thathis edits only are ment to remove articles from categories thus blanking them and Attentionseeking vandalism in orrder to seek to bring attention by other pov warriors to join his side as well as Redirect vandalism The user has now since decided to edit under an anon  talk  contribs in which he has nw used edit summries to to justfiy his vandalism all of which i have reverted Now i see the missresprsenting and addation of misleading information in lue of the facts that have been presented to the user to be vandalism theirfor i will treat them as vandalism and if you see fit to blcok me then so be it but be sure that after the block has expired if that it is still misleading and misrepreseative i will change it agian I am not here to make friends or to have wikilove or be part of theis community experiment that you downplay i am here to present information    trácht ar
