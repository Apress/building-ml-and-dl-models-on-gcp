outdentDavid  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article Copyvio or no anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now I repeat my previous advice base an article on Sport England 

Im also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on Georges talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL Youll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern personally I think that it is manageable although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it 

On the question of the image I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the separately deleted logo This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fairuse rationale It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logoidentity and release it for others to do with what they wish  are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it However if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it by clicking Upload file on the menu on the left making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information  the upload page will walk you through this 

Finally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject Youll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together Cheers  talk
