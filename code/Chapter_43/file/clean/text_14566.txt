Ill clear this up about my intentions  I have been told or glanced over in passing several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors in discussions of Virginia  These things are dismissed as fancy but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception  So you see I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecksbut I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity  One need not endorse a belief of association but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas  People think that just because impoverished ScotchIrish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs that they were some noble savages though they were not Cherokee but in fact Andrew Jacksons henchmen  So many ideas here wreak of Crank person nonsense  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims  Are you sitting in a trailor right now trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle  Civil Wars Reconstruction is a real bitch

That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core in true history

See here
Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage via Louisiana and Florida colonies  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways  Please do not spread fantasies as facts in this article  This work as it is makes me laugh my ass off at the premise of what its trying to do   0841
