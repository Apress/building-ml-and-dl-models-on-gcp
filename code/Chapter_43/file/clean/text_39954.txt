Editwarring 

In light of JoyDiamonds latest revert and angry edit summary in this article I left the following on her talk page

You stated less than 24 hours ago that you were not going to editwar at the Bouley page yet you are edit warring  In fact this is daytwo of you choosing to edit war there  In case you are not familiar with what edit warring really is you might want to read WPs article on edit warring  Reverting the same thing several times is edit warring  it also puts you in danger of violating 3RR  Please  rather than just reverting stuff you dont like or agree with talk about it first on the talk page  Please dont just blindly revert and plase dont shout in your edit summaries or use edit summaries to vent angerfrustration  If all of this unproductive and unhelpful behavior continues I will have no choice but to get an administrator involved again and you can believe that even though they havent made themselves known yet there are admins already watching whats going on at the Bouley article  Please just stop this uncivil uncooperative behavior and work within WPs  policies and guidelines  If you dont you are putting yourself in danger of being banned and having the article locked from editing once again
