The timeline starts at 1970 because the original article seems to have been written by someone who doesnt recognize the existence of the Bronze Age which runs roughly 19701985  The statement that the period begins in the mid80s was addedchanged by someone who does recognize the Bronze Age  Thats why the inconsistency
What we should do is create a Bronze Age article and just get rid of the references to 1970 in here  But its too easy for naysayers to kill the article by selectively demanding references that arent demanded for GoldSilverModern
