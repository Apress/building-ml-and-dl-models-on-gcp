OK let this be enough for now Wesley I dont see how an interaction cessation should mean no discussion here if its ongoing Meowy is not going to edit articles youre working that they normally wouldnt edit or have edited and is not going to engage you about such articles I think thats what the tacit agreement was Meowy isnt hounding you and wont Mate can certainly be taken as a flippant word depending on context If you all can keep it neutral that would be ever so nice to put it limeystyle for you two Brits PREFER doesnt say anything about articles under mediation and if it did the mediation isnt accepted yet Meowy is perfectly in their right to edit the article though they would be wise to exercise caution and work around the areas of contentionI have not heard that they have strayed into those areas so thats fine Wesley I dont know what some admin told you in which context and it doesnt matter as far as Im concerned If some smarter admin knows better I gladly stand corrected but I think Meowy has enough common sense to avoid controversy here PREFER does mean that if editwarring is taking place I might protect the article fully and Ill take whichever one happens to be up Can we move on
