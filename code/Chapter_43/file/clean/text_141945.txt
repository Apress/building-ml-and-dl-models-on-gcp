Yesterday I made some quick changes to the articles for they are obvious not related to Sigibert the Lame I saw an internetpage that stated they were children of Sigibert II of Austrasia and then highly relectantly changed the text in may be Sigibert II to moderate the original claims However today after consulting Christian Settipani and Butlers Lives of the Saints on their supposed nameday I quickly discovered that both dont mention them So I have deleted the relationship to Sigibert in the articles Googling the two did not result in any reliable source and I really dont know the two However there are several placesnames and churches named after BaldericBaudry both in France and Belgium The abbey did really exist and I am willing to believe they were actual real persons Having said that I have serious doubts if the text of the articles will ever be expanded in something worthwile So should we keep the articles Are they worth mentioning in an encyclopedia I dont have a clue Its your call
