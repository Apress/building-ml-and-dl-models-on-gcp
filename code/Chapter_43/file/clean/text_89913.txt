Wow that was quick

I had been in the midst of composing the following reponse

Thank you for the magnanimity in overlooking my latter comments AGK youre too kind
First of all though it is true that I learned that NYB is an attorney from Wikipediocracy there are no entries in relation to you on that website as a simple search via their search engine would have indicated had you taken the time to check as a courtesy 
The fact of the matter is I learned about your status as an undergraduate studying law from your own User page Hi Im Anthony an undergraduate and Wikipedia contributor from Scotland where you make it a point to make it prominent that you are
an undergraduate
studying law
from Scotland
Well good for you Maybe someday youll even become an attorney after you graduate from college and maybe pass a bar exam that is 
Now the edit summary of that diff of your eliminating that information from your User page is sort of interestingoffwiki stuff probably isnt interesting to most people
And what is even more interesting is that it occurred on August 24 just after youd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topicban me from the Tea Party movement article 
Why is it do you suppose that I for one would not be interested in such information about you
Clearly there is a question as to your WPCompetence as far as Im concerned but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page 
At any rate I have to get some sleep now so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbos Talk page and follow the links Ive linked to you Talk page there as well 
As far as Im concerned and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page WPSPADE is the operative policy here
Ive merely repeated information youd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons
Clearly I disagree with your FoF and decisions and question your WPCOMPETENCE to serve on ARBCOM in light of the unjust actions you have take against me 
Is that a violation of WPCIVIL 連絡 見学迷惑
