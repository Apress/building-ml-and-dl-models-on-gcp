Responding to your request I am thinking that one way that MUCH improved article could be improved even more would be if you would consider providing more sources throughout For example During the 1990s Albano became a vegetarian and shed 150 lbs following a health scare He later suffered a heart attack but quickly recovered in 2006 are two sentences that could use some form of reference for verification You might want to look at this article as an example of how to do the referencing  Great work thusfar
