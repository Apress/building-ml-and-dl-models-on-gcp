Hi Paranoid I aggree that the Moscow page needs work We also need to work on articles within moscow  for example the MSU page is shocking bad But Id argue that most people who add to the moscow page have an honest interest and fondness for the place or they wouldnt bother editing it Maybe what we need is a List of Moscow related articles needing work or some such 
The Recreation section is bad and It been an eyesore since feb What should we add to it Theres a F1 circuit being built in the south anybody want to add that also some stuff on the football clubs would be good we can leave out the supporter violence which is a usual thing all over the world To be honest I dont know much about this area  not a football fan
Id also argue against only adding material which is positive We shouldnt have an audience only of americans in mind
