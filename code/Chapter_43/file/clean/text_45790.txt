The info I tried to include from these sources is almost fully available from various alternative press sources as direct interviews with involved persons or as review from reporters on the case The number of such interviews and other sources will doubtlessly grow with time So theres really no need to use the particular sources you fight against so much But at this moment my feeling is that the majority of active skeptics here just dont want a neutral article about the subject and I feel Ive really done my best for Wikipedia Maybe I should give you some more time to evaluate the case and understand that your position is biased so I dont have to fight an epic battle for each small info I include Or maybe life will bring about more info on the case In either case my feeling is that you dont deserve more of my time and attention here for now Thanks
