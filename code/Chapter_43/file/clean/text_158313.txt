Hi Felix You must be referring to the content of TemplateWikiProject Cornwallguide I cant even find the standard set of headings that it mentions But its not really worth tweaking such minor elements is it The whole wikiproject needs updating if its to regain its usefulness and that would need someone prepared to take the initiative and enough interested editors to commit to helping Moribund wikiprojects have become a common feature in recent years Â JIM
