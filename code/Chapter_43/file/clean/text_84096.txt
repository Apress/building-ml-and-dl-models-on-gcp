The likelihood of a nowin situation increases when an editor accepts payment to write about subjects on Wikipedia That is its exceedingly difficult to maintain WPNPOV when adding content on behalf of a subject who in essence is apt to try to maintain editorial oversight of their article through the paid writer And we writers do like to get paid for our efforts Your disclosure was important however with or without it the edits will be observed for neutrality and intent That doesnt suggest a close priesthood so much as the desire to remove content that appears promotional And I think the concerns have been well fleshed out at the article talk page  as well as at the COI noticeboard
