RE Deletion of 2004 Australian Election results 

Galloglass I understand your concerns However the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example which is a historically important seat oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard who had held for the seat over 3 decades and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable The 2004 Election results remain on many multiple pages because noone has updated these pages and this is what I am striving to do 

If you feel that my actions are incorrect which I can completely understand from your perspective maybe you could create a new page much like the one for Bennelong and list the 2004 and earlier Election results here
