I think the above speaks for itself  Once a hoaxer is caught they will accuse others of doing what they areits basic projection  I wonder if Starblind is equally amused at the above as I am as we dont even know one another  A selftouted geneologist expert sic  This says it all  A true genealogist would at least know how to spell the name of their vocation  Im sure the audacity of a nonWikipedia member telling an actual member that he should be removed from wikipedia is plain to everyone  As a nonmember I would never have such audacity to call for a member to be removed  I am however calling for the nonmember hoaxer with many aliases to go away and am begging members to purge him from wikipedia  My email is public  This genologist likes to hide behind his aliases  His admixture of fact delusion rudeness and paranoid harrangue reveals him to be the true hoaxer
