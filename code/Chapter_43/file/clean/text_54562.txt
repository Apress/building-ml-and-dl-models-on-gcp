Its not really better per se but it looks a bit more like a photograph now  Im afraid there is no way that it could be gotten any better than this given the extreme poor quality of the original but I blurred it to remove some of the JPEG artefacts which makes it look more like a blurry photo and less blocky and I adjusted the contrast and converted to greyscale  I dont know what you had hoped for but Im afraid this is all you can get at this point if you dont have the original

By the way the description of it says its the Burma Cub Scouting logo in the Fair use rationale which cant be right and doesnt anywhere say what were actually looking at beyond the arses of a lot of men in uniform
