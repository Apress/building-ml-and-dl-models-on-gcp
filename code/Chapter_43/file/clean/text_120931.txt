The use as shown above is a breach of WPSAYWHEREYOUREADIT

NB the article Affaire Des Fiches currently does not use this citation but instead relies of a link to French Wikipedia frAffaire des fiches which in this context is an unreliable source

I came across this WPSAYWHEREYOUREADIT problem when editing Anticlericalism and fixed it with this edit on 27 July 2013 I have only just investigated this problem because that edit also threw up a much bigger problem see Wikipedia talkWikiProject CatholicismUnacknowledged internal copying and problems with citations

Unless anyone else wants to help I will fix this relatively minor problem by including the original source in the citations but for those copying text between articles please place a comment in edit history not only does that meet WikipediaCopying within Wikipedia but it also helps editors who follow you to find and fix errors like this one
