et tu JamesMLane I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing

But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence To suggest that Im some kneejerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way I

m here to remove POV Period Now it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a leftwing cabal and a sinister one at that  
Remember you cant say you were just joking because as weve learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece unless you SPECIFICALLY say I was joking when you make your statment it means youre as serious as AIDS so I thank you for that illuminating revelation It is duly noted

Anyway it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole

As for your arguement  we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion an articlewithinanarticle that discusses the subject he addressed I can only say McCainBlack Baby Rumorsee above lol 

I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles I wish youd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherrypicking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated

So I reject your argumentation for now In fact Ive understood that MoveOns petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default

And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another Or if you like we can just use the conservative 911 family groups statements Since we  dont want to make this article booklength do we 

Heres my bottom line Whats good for the goose is good for the gander And what Ive seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if its good for the goose democratliberal and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander republicanconservative I hope you dont think Im the only one who sees this Oh btw when I make post these trenchant observations Im used to getting rebuked for getting away from content or talking politics Funny how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke  Must be cabal club privileges huh  Take care Big Daddy Ps I do like your style though  I appreciate the sober analysis that generally exudes from your posts  Even if I dont agree I respect the approac you have
