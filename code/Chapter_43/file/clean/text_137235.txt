The plot thickens  Spelling corrections must be okay Right  Or maybe not  Civil disobedience  I love it  I think its a losing argument but intriguing  I suspect a ban is a ban More interesting to me is Caslibers note that science stuff is okay So if its not fringey youre in the clear I think  You just cant mess with exopolitics thank goodness  What about science fiction  Can you start with the newer Star Trek stuff and work backwards  I tend to favor the classics
