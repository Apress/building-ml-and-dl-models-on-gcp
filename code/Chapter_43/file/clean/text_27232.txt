Im not sure that many said any such thing nor what value that would have even if they had done  this isnt a game of promises or about bargaining and haggling nor is it a democracy where what the majority say counts In any event I know that I repeatedly and consistently said that Taiwan should of course be used more in article text and that it would be odd to have one terminology for the main article title and another for references elsewhere eg in text which of course it would I and others also said it would not change in every instance or every context which of course it should not not least more historical ones Anyway the President of Taiwan may well need to be referred to and named as such if that is indeed the common name If Ma Yingjeou can cope with the rest of the world doing it already Im sure hell cope with WP doing it as well You might have to as well  talkedits
