I dont mind presenting alternative concepts but Im not sure that your sources really support your view  This one says for example that MAH seeks to provide appropriate secure well located and affordable housing  clearly suggesting that housing can be inappropriate insecure badly located and still affordable  The Brisbane TImes article considers only cost relative to income  Queensland clearly supports a totalcostofhousing approach in practice thus their interest in transportation costs for example  In the US publicly funded projects must meet more requirements than just cost but we call a fallingdown shack indecent or a health hazard not unaffordable  If Australia uses affordable housing as a code word for what the rest of the world calls decent and affordable housing then I dont mind including that definition  but your original proposal to replace everyone elses definition is not acceptable to me
