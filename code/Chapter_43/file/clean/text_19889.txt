Wow that discussion is way beyond stupid Nothing but media hype What the hell is that based on The Wikipedia page on the shooting is over 20000 words long and the article on the trial is well over 15000 How can that be if those internet randoms are correct in their dismissal of this as something of little encyclopedica value And Retrolord you dont know what youre talking about I live in the UK and Ive been getting daily updates on this controversy on the national BBC news Thankfully I was able to find the articles without them being on the main page but no thanks to you apparently It is unbelievable to me that Wikipedia can be so ignorant in how it chooses what is and is not important enough to display on the front page
