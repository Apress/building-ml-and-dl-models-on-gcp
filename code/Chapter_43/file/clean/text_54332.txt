Dramatic oversectioning 

Its not exactly vandalism but the microtimeline style you are trying to rewriterevert the Cynthia McKinney article in is entirely inappropriate for WP biographies  Please take a look at any bio for another congressperson or in general activist politician etc  This sort of strictly dateoriented sectioning down to the sentence or short paragraph is simply not done and its not done with the very good reason that it reads extremely poorly  In a more reasonable sized section several paragraphs at least the prose describes the dates associated with the eventsactions being described

Actually thers quite a bit of purple prose and partial sentences awkward wordings outright repetitions etc in the main text remaining but reverting my efforts to clean it up is in extremely rude form  Please dont do that And dont add back so many headings there are probably too many remaining even with my removals but Ill probably make another pass or three at cleanup
