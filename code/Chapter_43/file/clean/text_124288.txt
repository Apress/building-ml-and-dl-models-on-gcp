First edition preferred 

Hi  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain published in 1945 Having collected LEngle novels for over 30 years Ive still never even SEEN the original cover of this book  and if I did Id have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them but its not always possible For example my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an exlibrary rebinding  Ive searched online for the cover of the first edition and nobody has one posted  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art No big deal at this end  I know youre just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible Still Ill be very surprised if we ever get 100 compliance on LEngle books of the 1940s to 1960s Regards and keep up the good work   Talk  contribs
