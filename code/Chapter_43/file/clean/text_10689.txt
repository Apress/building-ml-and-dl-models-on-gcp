Seems a new page on wikipedia may be warranted
Xbox One gets to know you It learns what you like and what you dont And brings it all together on your own personal home screen And because every Xbox One comes with Kinect it responds naturally to your voice movements and gestures  The Xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience  The kinect sensor detects when you are smiling crying angry or bored Every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood Even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark
