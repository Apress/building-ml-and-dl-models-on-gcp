Thanks for pointing out that people should not unilaterally decide to add sourcing information without references  I was tired of arguing and it was nice someone else spoke up  IT IS APPRECIATED  If he wants references the Muslim histories also speak of a week of waiting and light skirmishes as the invading Umayyad forces waited for their entire army to gather so his claim it was christian sources is plainly wrong historically
