Personally I dont believe the Controversy section is appropriate for this wiki at all    At best it is a minor matter of interest only to Exetel users and for the very great majority of them it was of no consequence at all

There are wikis in place for several other Australian ISPs and none of them have more than a description of the company and their services plus links to some of their subsidiary companies and some of their services    I think something similar is appropriate for the Exetel wiki and that would appear to be what already exists

Speaking of links I also think that many of the links which are currently at the bottom of the Exetel wiki are also inappropriate and should be removed specifically those that point to news stories and blogs as these have been prioven to be full of inaccuracies misconceptions and outright lies

I have no idea what drives someone like Macktheknifeau and his fellows to conduct such a malicious misinformed and inane attack on a supplier of internet services even if they have been wronged and particularly after they have cancelled their service and movedon to another supplier but wikipedia is not the place to conduct such an attack if indeed anywhere is appropriate   DarkGaucho
