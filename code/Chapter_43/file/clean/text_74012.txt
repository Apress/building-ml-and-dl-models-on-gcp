List of cities and towns in Utah

I appreciate your input on the article I had recently viewed the article Colorado municipalities and found the population change section quite interesting There is certainly other info on that article that is unnecessary but I do believe that it is useful and interesting information or at the very least I dont understand what makes it less relevant than something like elevation or especially median household income The 2000 census info itself may not be current but I feel that the growth of the city is relevant to the subject  certainly the growth rate of a city is a useful piece of information I understand the argument that colored text is not acceptable because of color blindness I was simply copying what was found in the Colorado municipalities article I do not know enough about how the tables work to do it in a more acceptable way myself but I would ask that the population change information allow to be included  if the color of the text were black then I dont think that information alone would keep it from remaining a featured list
