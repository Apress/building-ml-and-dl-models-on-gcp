I have differed from reporting your editing to admins because I believe that you may not understand what Wikipedia is about You cannot post your private family crest on a Wikipedia article just because the article is about your family name Unless you can provide reliable authoritative evidence that this is the historical crest of the Claudio family described in the article then your addition will be removed Please do not reinsert it or you will be facing a block from editing Wikipedia Thank you    Velella Talk
