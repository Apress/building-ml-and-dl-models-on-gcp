Andrew please note this article is about a business run by a Georgia Tech alumni Leland Strange who has been involved in the company in one way or another sine 1984 The article helps give background on other articles VisionPlus was created by this compnay prior to them selling the rest of the business to First Data First Data this compnay was spun out of First Data  TYSYS lists this compnay as a competitor and one on prepaid cards the compnay makes products to support that market There is no mention of any of the companys current products or discussion of their current sales efforts The artilce is very similiar to the articles on First Data and TYSYS If you are nomintaing this for deletion then I suggest you do the same for TYSYS and First Data Finally please note that it was reviewed by Trevor MacInnis and he said it was OK but needed more links which is why they were added to the other places If the credit card one was not helpful we can delete it
