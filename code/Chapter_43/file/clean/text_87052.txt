Hello thank you for changing your edits I noticed you have also directly cited tweets on the Maria ChappelleNadal page and would hope you understand that those fall under much the same conditions for reversion as citing Youtube as a source The policy at Wikipedia whose function is foremost that of an encyclopedia has a high standard of asking assertions to be verifiable not only true Similarly the means of such verifiability are reliable sources who are independent thirdparties Exceptional primary sources may be used but they must be interpreted only through separate secondarysource materials In this way Wikipedia content can be relied upon as neutral and informed Thank you happy editing
