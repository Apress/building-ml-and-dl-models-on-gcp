Response

When I delete another editors message from my talk page it serves as a receipt to you and to everybody else that I have read and thus I acknowledge what you have written I do not normally respond to other editors unless they have a particular question If they leave just a comment then I do not normally give a response Rest assured I do read each and every one of them Regards
