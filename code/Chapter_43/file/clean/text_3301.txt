I second this If you have sources which talk about the importance of Konigsberg to Old Prussians and Masurians the stuff on Lithuanians can be combined with the stuff on the Poles  and I already proposed changing the name of the section to Poles and Lithuanians in Konigsberg then please add them and Ill try to help with that myself
