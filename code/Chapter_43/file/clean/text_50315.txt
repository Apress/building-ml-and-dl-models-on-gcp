To quote Dilger At least another 17 citations in Wikipedias article are used to attack the legitimacy of the jury that awarded Apple damages Browbeating the jurys reputation in a passive voice Wikipedia states that the jurys decision was criticized for being Applefriendly possibly leading to increased costs for Android smartphone users while questioning the jurys impartiality and how quickly it reached its verdict And while the article emphasizes that the jury awarded Samsung zero damages in its counter suit it doesnt cite any sources examining why the jury tossed out all of Samsungs patent claims or why the jury decided after the first day of deliberations that it believed Samsung was in the wrong It just portrays that decision as being rash and unfair Clearly Dilger is biased so the question is he lying Or exaggerating Or just so biased he is blinkered by his view and cant read a fair article As you say this article should just be about the litigation not which multinational was right or wrong
