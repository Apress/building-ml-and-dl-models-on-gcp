Gaimhreadhan has moved the following out of context comment by Vintagekits Mentor SirFozzie from his talk page to this page where it can be seen in context
I recommend that you drop this You have been asked somewhat nicely twice by Admins to either take it to WPSSP if you had any further suspicions Now I am giving you pretty much a final warning Accusing a new editor of being a sockpuppet breaks WPCIVIL and WPNPA There is methods to deal with sockpuppetry on WP Use them I also notice several comments aimed at trolling other users and soapboaxing You are on the edge Take care not to step over  
1 I have not made and am not making any accusations of sockpuppetry Please dont confuse Domer48s wrongful and hysterical misunderstanding of my actual words with what I actually wrote Allegations of Sockpuppetry are WPs equivalent of a Witch hunt  and I refuse to participate in such silly nonsense
My understanding is that neither Tyrenius nor yourself are acting as admins here unless you specifically state that you are so acting If that is the case I will of course follow your advice  even though it seems perverse
2 Had you not addressed specific remarks to me I would have stayed silent  as you both should have done
3 This is what I have already stated I think it would be very helpful at this early stage for UserBrixton Busters to confirm or deny that he previously edited WP using different user names to his current new user name of Brixton Busters   its entirely a matter for him whether he chooses to reveal those identities or not
and
4 However if Brixton Buster and not you or any other members of the team does so assert ie that he BrixtonBuster is a genuine new editor and has not previously edited on WP using other and different user names then I will say no more and as Ive previously stated if BB does instead confirm the obvious ie that BB is not a brand new editor its entirely a matter for him whether he chooses to reveal those previous identities BB has edited under or not
and
5 Now why dont we all pause to allow the subject of this discussion to speak for himselfkiwiexile at DMOZ
