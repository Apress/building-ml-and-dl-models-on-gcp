How many chromosomes per cell 

Im no expert so Ive not gone in and edited the following statement from the article but it seems odd to me as it flies in the face of everything Ive ever been taught about chromosomes

 each male cell contains only one X or one Y chromosome but not both This is true for nearly all male cells not just sperm cells

thats from the section Whose genome was sequenced

My understanding was that all male cells had 46 chromosomes except for sperm

So am I illinformed or if not could someone correct that sentence to whatever it should have been
