I understand what is being conveyed in your decisionbut still not sure if the reasoning is along the lines of what the intent of the link was for I have read the guidelines to external links I was using the official links section that allows an organization to present coverage to what the content article presented in Wiki article The site linked has historical context and are run by the Confederate Heritage Trust which has put on Siege of Charleston historical events during the last 13 years Our work is recognized by the National Park Service South Carolina Historic Society and other historical organizations I went down the avoidable list and did not see where my link was part of those listed Take care
