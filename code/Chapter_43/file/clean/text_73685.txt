Modernist I got burned out by the Lucy wars and I just needed to go off and do something on my own without any hasel if that makes sence Hence Fragment of a Crucifixion which I intend to twin with the Picasso in priority over the next month or so Im not sure how you sit with Bacon but having you on board as a coauthor and conom would be great Im going to  once again ask Liz to coboth articles though I imagine she might be fairly sick of me at this stage
