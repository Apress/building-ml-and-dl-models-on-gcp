Microsoft the one we love to hate   and why 

Microsoft neglected and treated like trash  Why since the interference several years ago ignorant persons everyhere have been speaking against Microsoft with complete loss of admiration and humility is really beyond me  I laugh when I read that Bing is forced upon me  Really  as if AOL did not exclusively use Google for HMMNN How many years It is simple to type in a heading any heading in fact  Just the other day I tried using this new Bing because there are just so many naysayers that have a hyped sense of what they have coming to them  I really did not expect much of this lowly Microsoft company that usually releases mere fizzs in its pool of tech  Low and behold I found that it worked just as good as Google but with a better layout  Hmmph
