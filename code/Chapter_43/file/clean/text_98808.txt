Greetings Nick I would like to register a complaint against a user Heshe is registered to IP address 6889176172 I see that you had blocked himher previously Anyhow heshe keeps making unwarranted or unreferenced changes to the Wiki entry on Dancepop I realize that any and all Wiki articles are open to additions subtractions etc but this person keeps adding Soulja Boy who ISNT technically dancepop I wouldnt have a problem if hed come into the talk page and discuss it I added a talk subject to the Dancepop page for duscussion but heshe never responds they just keep adding it What should I do about this person They seem to have vandalized a LOT of articles

Thanks Mirror Ball
