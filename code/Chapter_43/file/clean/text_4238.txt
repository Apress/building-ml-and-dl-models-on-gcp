ACES09 

Since the IP editor who keeps clammoring for this items inclusion seems unwilling to do so I thought Id bring this to talk Does anyone else besides this IP think the ACES09 rivalry merits inclusion in the article  I just dont think we need to include a blogbased fued between fans of teams who have never even played each other merits inclusion  I understand that it was in some Seattle papers but lots of things are in lots of papers  I dunno hopefully we can get some discussion going in lieu of the edit war    Alpaugh
