You can open the edit this page tab on the existing article much in the way that you sent your message to me  Then you can reword or rewrite it in any way that you see fit  Once it meets your satifsfaction you may choose to click on the show preview button and see exactly how it will look as a Wikipedia article  You can then either edit it further or select save page and then click on it  At this point it will appear as the newlyrevised Wikipedia article and will remain as such until you or someone else chooses to edit it again 

Thanks for your interest in this fasicnating project
