Hi I would like to ask about your opinion before I retire from Wikipedia A conflict occured between me and userLcnj concerning the List of Lebanese people article I ask to compare mine and his version of the article on the history page and give your opinion I am retiring because I tried to make the article look better while someone constantly added unnecessary remarks and no justice was given to me Give me your say if you will Thanks
