Right Well heres what Ive done just now 

Changed section heading modern philosophy to philosophical topics to move the article more in line with Lacs proposal The text there still reads in a historical sort of way but that shouldnt distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section under the subheading modern western philosophy
A bit of text in the rationalismempiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a naturalist and Hume the first empiricist This is obviously wrong so I changed it

Something problematic the sentence During this era religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy is either misleading assuming secular philosophy to mean not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God etc or trivially true assuming the same to mean completely nonreligious philosophy Assuming the former and assuming we take this era to mean the Modern era it counts as a counterexample that Descartes was completely religious that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations Lockes generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion the man thought atheists were not to be trusted and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion The more stark example of Berkeley already mentioned in the text is an understatement it is not just his disputes with Newton but rather absolutely anything that Berkeley said which could not be divorced from his religious views including his theory of vision Malebranche is another example Its my impression that there wasnt a genuine cooling off from appeals to religion until the late modern period So I recommend the sentence be scrapped
