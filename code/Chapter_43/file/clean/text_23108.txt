User23 editor seems accustomed like here only to issuing silly threats and conceited patriarchal condescension which she uses to dismiss as reliable  on the topic of extremely virulent homophobia and indeed by a prime minister of a country to wit at a  par with Zimbabwe only an EU candidate country nonetheless  statements made by the Gay Straight Alliance one of the coorganisers of the Pride Parade seemingly with the intent of making it appear as if the GSA could possibly be unreliable on the very issue of that very Pride Parade or on the issue of the prime ministers unacceptable discourse about LGBTs and the parade 

 I do not understand how could possibly someone anyone  not with a brain but with a head  claim that the GSA the coorganiser of the event cancelled by the homophobe prime minister who calls gays abnormal and his own fellow party memmber who supports LGBT people a person with a darkened mind because of exposure to proLGBT radiation in Brussels are an unreliable source on this
