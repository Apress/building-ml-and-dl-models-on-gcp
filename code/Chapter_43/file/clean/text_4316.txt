Phi Sigma Kappa Chapters 

Hello Naraht  Im not convinced that WPEL requires or suggests the removal of website links to the chapters cited on the page List of Phi Sigma Kappa chapters  You deleted them all not even attempting the median step of turning these into reference items  I disagree with the necessity of your edit but have little time to address the matter as I am at work  However I thought I would challenge you on this since you and I have corresponded and I appreciate your previous work  Please know if I am not convinced at your explanation I may revert or seek a poll
