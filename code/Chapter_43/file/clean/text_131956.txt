Langston Hughes
Hi Bobcat I saw that you have submitted Langston Hughes for GA review Having been involved in some of the GA process I have to say I dont think LH is ready for this for various reasons There is not one major editor looking after or improving the page and hasnt been for many years This means theres nobody involved whos ready and set to do all the work to bring it up to GA standard Much of it has no citation which is a must for a GA There is no section about the themes andor style of his work critical appraisal and such which is also needed I appreciate its a vote of confidence in the article which is great but I know that there is a long GA appraisal backlog and its a pretty time consuming process for reviewers Theres work waiting since January to be reviewed Maybe have a look at poets articles such as W B Yeats Maya Angelou and Walt Whitman to get a sense of whats needed Editors often submit articles for a peer review first to get a general sense of where the article is at and what works needs doing before applying for the whole GAFA hog So Id personally recommend withdrawing the application for GA and maybe work on some of the article points until the basics are in place Thanks and best wishes
