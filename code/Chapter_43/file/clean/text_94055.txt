Why Phil 

Why do you remain as an admin You lack the ability to remain within a NPOV yet you quote this rule on a consistent basis YOU change and edit at YOUR will as YOU see fit and what YOU feel is correct regardless of the facts

Do you see a common connection here Everything is centered around YOU Phil When or if someone challenges YOU the almighty admin Phil you simply remove their comments ban their IP or block them from editing 

Your actions are a disgrace and you would do everyone a favor by stepping down from your post
