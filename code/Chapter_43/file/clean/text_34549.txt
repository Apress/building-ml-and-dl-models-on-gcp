HJ do you know approximately how many nonarticle namespace edits Heymid has made since the last time he was unblocked a few months ago Do you know what percentage of the total account edits these nonarticle edits constitute Do you know how many times since the unblock Heymid has been told not to poke his nose into discussions that dont concern him You dont have to answer these questions but please spend a few seconds considering them Now to my actual question the next time Heymid gets blocked and tries to get unblocked by promising to stick to article editing only will you believe these promises and unblock the account

Oh and if you feel Im violating some important principle by asking these questions please feel free to block me like you did the last time If you do please make sure its a very long block since I obviously dont understand why your last block was justified
