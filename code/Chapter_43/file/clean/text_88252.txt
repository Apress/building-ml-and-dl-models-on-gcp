No that is not quite what he said  Under the context that the Sharptons and Jacksons tell black Americans how to think he said  I think black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves  Under the premise from which made his comment there should be no controversy surrounding that comment  From the wording his toughts are that black Americans do think for themselves and are listening less and less to Sharpton and Jackson  MM does a nice job of taking that out of context as well by stating that quote after the Mfer comment
