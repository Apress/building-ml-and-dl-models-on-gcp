A year ago India was scarred by some of the worst sectarian violence since partition when up to 2000 Muslims were killed in pogroms in the western state of Gujarat ostensibly sparked by an arson attack by Muslims on a train that killed 59 Hindu activists Human rights organisations in India the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the wellorchestrated attacks the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP or World Hindu Council and its youth offshoot the Bajrang Dal devotees of the monkeygod Hanuman

Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad collected mainly as taxfree charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny So it should  as should the links between these groups and Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata party BJP

Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasiparamilitary body the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS or Association of National Volunteers which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP Described by Jawaharlal Nehru Indias first prime minister as an Indian version of fascism the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations This structure facilitates armslength moneyraising It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and ChristiansThe RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world  a danger the world has woken up to Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups success They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used
