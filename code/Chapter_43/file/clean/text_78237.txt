Hey Kpjas as I remember I regularly got back to your warnings with mostly appologetic notes With English being my second language its not so easy for me to adress all your options for a complain or explanation of the dispute Sometimes it takes time to formulate the right sentence with the right words to complain or go into further discussions and explanations And I might not always have enough time for doing all that Id rather not complain or go with short notes than to write something that would sound funny and vague
Also I would ask you to pay more attention to what I say in my edits and discussions because the behavior I present in it is much better that the behavior that Ivan Stambuk or any of his group does At least I go with facts and arguments which they never have
Sorry but in an extent of my ability I wont allow the croatian nationalistic POV to infiltrate on wikipedia They can have theirown isolated croatian wikipedia which is mostly based on lies and misinterpretations of the facts but wherever I see a misleading information regarding any linguistic or other well known fact which is poisoned by this cronationalistic group I will react and try to correct the facts
Please try to concentrate more on what I point out in my discussions and see what demages and nonaccepable changes theyve done to the templates maps and even some of the texts concerning Serbocroatian language Shtokavian dialect South Slavic languages etc It has to stop theyve been stopped many times before and with appropriate intervetions they will be stopped again because its ruining wikipedia as a reliable source of informations Regards

My best regards to you Hexagon1 as well Thanks 2486116250
