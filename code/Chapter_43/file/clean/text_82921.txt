I agree that Raven has has a lot to do with the sucess of this group I really do But I also think that keeping the girl in Walt Disney Records was a bad choice for a debut album Walt Disney Records is obviously going to cath much mainstream attention with the exception of the soundtracks of the CG movies and HSM

I also think that adding another girl for the movie would be a good idea but not to the group unless it invloves a reality show The show would catch some attention for the girls even if it failed and could possibly boost them more than they even areI also think that them opening an official MySpace page did something too A lot of people access MySpace and they could attract more fans that way

Also I have been wondering if you noticed at all the Cheetah Sisters Barcelona Mix on the Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack If you have a chance listen to that song for me It does not include Raven It was rerecorded for this soundtrack There are also rumors of a Greatest Hits album to be in the works after their Hollywod Records debut is avalible for some time And since they rerecorded Cheetah Sisters as an actual group without Raven I am asuming that if a Greatest Hits album does eventually come along it will be full of rerecorded material that does not include Raven If you also bought the Cheetah Girls Partys Just Begun Tour book you will see that there is a photospread in there and one of the pictures originally containted Raven

Look on the main page for this group and find their picture That image has been photoshopped In that version used to promote the tour and the soundtrack they made it look as if they were all standing together originally They werent Raven was standing in between of Adrienne and Sabrina In the book a picture from that same photoshoot was included and the lyrics to Strut replaced Ravens body

I think that Hollywood Records is making it very clear that raven has nothing to do with The Cheetah Girls and probably never will again I can also assume that the girls not want to have anything to do with herwell they do not want to be tied to her Raven has said that she is done with Disney after her Adventures in Babysitting remake since she does not want to be tied down to a kid franchise I am assume that this upset Disney and now their are rumors of Raven being dropped from Hollywood Records and moved to Arista Records which would explain the delay in her album release

All I know is Raven is not part of The Cheetah Girls Galleria is
