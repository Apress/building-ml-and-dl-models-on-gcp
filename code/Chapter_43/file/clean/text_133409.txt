Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article Nor am I the only one who thinks this Please see the section immediately above this article Or better yet spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again I have no more time for this   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article No summaries of Heideggers important concepts are given No understanding of any of Heideggers ideas are conveyed Since you have decided to destroy my work you can keep your poor article which reads as if it was machinetranslated from a foreign language You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heideggers terms or concepts here or why anyone should care who he is This article is an embarassment indeed   
Words are important rather than space on the screen because people have different size screens I have a 27 inch screen and a 5 inch screen both of which I edit on The lead is the same amount of words on both screens but not the same number of screens for two different users Word counts give a reasonable approximation of length not dependent on the particularities of users devices fonts and other noncontent formatting Generally essays list word limits not page limits so page limits arent just fudged with font changes and others  Â Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
