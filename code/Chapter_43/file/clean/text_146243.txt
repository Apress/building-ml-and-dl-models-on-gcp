No Shii I do not act with any intimidation The concept of intimidation and its meaning is known to my mind of course  as it is known to you and all people But I never acted with behavioural intimidation 

  Please read my words with peace of mind and openmindedness to good faith In my input above I was impartially speaking about the Christian and Buddhist beliefs beliefs in causes and effects and the consequences of ones behaviour as delivered by God or the Law  
  Please refrain from statements and judgements directed towards my person Lets contribute in a mature and valable manner with arguments based on reason rather than emotional judgements or volatile dramatic wording 
  I do not need your apology just letting you know that your judgement about what I think or act is false and it is a violation to WP rules
