New Louisville definition
Since the Census Bureau has clearly defined the new Louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas I think there some details needed that need to be added defining Metro Government First it is important  to note that a KY Legislative bill dubbed the Lyndon Bill prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land If this were not the case then the unincorp areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left  Second this definition wont effect the new citys population growth since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses Third even if Suburban cities dont count toward the population their residents can still vote for Metro mayor and council members and will still receive Metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services
Personally I think the official municipality the entire county is what should make up this article regardless of what the Census Bureau says The smaller article with the balance is what should have the information for the censusdefined city  
Your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct What you are referring to is the LouisvilleJefferson County balance which is not the same thing as consolidated LouisvilleJefferson County Both are defined separately by the Census Bureau see here This article is about the consolidated LouisvilleJefferson County which is how the city is legally incorporated The confusion lies in the Census Bureaus use of balance figures when ranking cities rather than the consolidated figures Although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings  
The Census Bureau has accepted the Louisville Jefferson balance but not the CityCounty Consolidation which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and wont be in future censuses Because of the acceptence of the LouJef Balance my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation If this were not the case then the Balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs
Your assertion is not entirely correct The Census Bureau does in fact include the entire consolidated LouisvilleJefferson County in their estimates They also include a separate figure for the balance

Thats from the 2005 estimates the last number is the 2005 estimated population This article is not about the balance however Issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance articles talk page  

 Actual Population 
There are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper According to the Census bureau estimates the balance population is 556429 and not anywhere near 700000 What is the actual city proper population as that is to be what is listed I do not believe that Louisville has a population anywhere near that of Columbus Ohio We need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population There are several pages in Wikipedia listing the population as 699000 or so when the Census lists the population as 556429 I understand that several people especially those who live in the area want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status If it was a city I lived in I would like to do the same However that cannot be done here An actual correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed If we are able to we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city I am a little confused myself and I did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed  

There have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article  Please for the sake of your own knowledge read all the talk archives that cover this situation  Since there is a consensus thats currently overwhelmingly not in your favor you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up  UserStevietheman
