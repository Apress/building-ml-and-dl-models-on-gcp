Its definitely not a POV issue its a preference issue  POV involves actual content issues where unverified andor biased comments are made in the body of the article in relation to the subject like saying Roosevelt High School is known for its strong academic programs without any thirdparty sources to verfiy  It would be one thing if I owned the kentschoolsnet domain and was pushing it to further my own viewpoint or product or kentschoolsnet was not an official school site but neither is the case  The difference between the two domain names is simply a matter of technical ownership but not one of content or one being official and one not  Also they are not redirects to each other  For example the popular website httpwwwespncom is actually a redirect to the real address  If you type in wwwespncom or click on the link you will see the address in your browser change to httpespngocom  If that were the case here say kentschoolsnet redirected to kentk12ohus then yes it would make sense to simply type in the actual address rather than the easier to remember one  But in this case the Kent City Schools website exists on both domain names not one with a redirect to another
