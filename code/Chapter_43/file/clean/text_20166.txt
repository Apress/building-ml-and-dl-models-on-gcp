G4s arent really subject to debate  its a copy of the article that was deleted before  The only time that they merit debate is when the article is substantially different  As the conclusion of the first debate was that the subject of the article is unnotable improvements to the article do not change its outcome  However you can reopen the debate by going to deletion review  Posting the article again will only result in its deletion
