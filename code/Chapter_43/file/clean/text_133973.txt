This is more than four years ago but you asked us to translate a few Hungarian articles I think we did but have little record on our talk pages as we tend to clear them down regularly But we both live in Hungary now and if you want a word either ask UserMonkap my wife or me and we can probably have a stab at it We tend as we must to keep a separate identity on WP which is mostly for the best but occasionally if you leave it logged in she or me edits as the other That is not bad faith or sockpuppeting I assure you
