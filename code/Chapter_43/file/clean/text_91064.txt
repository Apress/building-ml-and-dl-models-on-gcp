clumsy staffing of the store by management

In Feb 2014 a Walmart department manager writing a long letter published in Gawker stated home office gives store managers a set amount of hours and payroll dollars that they can schedule peoplepay people in each area of the store and it is based on what the sales were in that department on that day the previous fiscal year So even though last year was a Friday it was snowing out and no one was shopping this year on a Saturday when its sunny out and everyone is shopping you wont have anyone around to help you because LAST YEAR we didnt make enough money

On reflection I just have a hard time believing this  Im sorry  You mean Walmart really doesnt take into account whether its a Friday with medium customers vs a Saturday with a lot of customers    So this guy is a department manager  His job is to lead his or her team and kept the assigned area stocked and put back together after customers tear it up to be frank about it  Just as a guess I think Walmart probably does have more cashiers on a Saturday  Okay so a customer is shopping and wants to know where something is  So the employee is not thrilled about helping the customer because the employee up to and including the department manager is just going to later get criticized for not getting more work done  Point well taken
