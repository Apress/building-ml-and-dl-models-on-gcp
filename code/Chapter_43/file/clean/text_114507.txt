Thanks so much for making the WPACCESS changes  I totally forgot about it and by the time I remembered youd already taken care of it  I hope you enjoy Bushells book  I found it a bit juvenile in places but I seem to remember that it did make me laugh in others Related to this topic I PRODd the two EastEnders novel articles that remained I originally intended to work on the first one at least but found no sources anywhere so I think the corresponding EastEnders book template and category may be defunct The category can be speedied after being empty for four days but could I possibly ask you to delete the template if you dont foresee any future need for it Frickative
