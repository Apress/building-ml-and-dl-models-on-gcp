Apparently there are no moderators at Wikipedia I reverted again because if you take a look at WikipediaVandalism it clearly states that blanking wholesale deletion of all or part of a page is considered vandalism and a violation of Wikipedia standards Technically this is not even a case for moderation Your actions are cause for at minimum a temporary suspention of your account I will wait for a moderator to eventually come along but you will lose your case Especially considering you keep saying you want to discuss the issue and find a compromise yet have not offered a single actionable compromise to implement while I have compromised and shortened the section down to a single sentence and link
