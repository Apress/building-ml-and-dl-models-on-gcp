 KM rating 
KM is the motor constant sometimes motor size constant defined as
fractausqrtP

where
 scriptstyle tau is the motor torque SI units Nm
 scriptstyle P is the resistive power loss SI units W

The motor constant is winding independent as long as the same conductive material used for wires eg winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant Kv but KM remains unchanged  KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application  Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor

It look to me as if the scope is well beyond the original article and if put anywhere  it should be herer
