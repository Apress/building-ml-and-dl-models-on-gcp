Noted I will take your comments under consideration  For the avoidance of doubt please refrain from any further administrative actions with regard to MickMacNee or any other party for the duration of the case
In the meantime I would be interested in any further comments you might have on the following issues
 Given that MickMacNee was already to remain blocked for 72 hours was immediate escalation of the block length necessary even in the context of a stated intent to resume the conduct in question  In particular Im interested in your thoughts on a whether the 72 hour period could instead have been used to reach a more amicable arrangement and b whether a removal of the underlying cause for conflict in this case Hammersofts redaction of his original remarks would have made any such statements of intent moot at the time the block expired
 A number of editors have suggested that Hammersofts comments were themselves personal attacks or may have intentionally or unintentionally baited MickMacNee into an aggressive response  To what degree is this explanation credible and if it is to what degree does it mitigate MickMacNees culpability
