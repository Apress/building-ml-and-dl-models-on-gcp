Geneology Nightmare 

The beginning of this article confuses Alexios the first with his grandson of the same name It says that he was the son of John II when John II was in fact the son of Alexios I Alexios the grandson was the son of John II The top picture entitled Depiction of Alexios as a young prince in Hagia Sophia Istanbul is also of Alexios the grandson who died young hence why he is frowning and not Alexios I 

I should also note that the lady Anna Dalassena is listed as the mother of Alexios I This is correct But it says that she fathered him with her grandson so that needs to be taken care of

Speaking of taking care of this problem I created my wiki account just now to address this problem Since my experience with wikipedia editing is so new I regret to say that I have absolutely no idea how to change it to make it right But clearly it needs to be fixed
