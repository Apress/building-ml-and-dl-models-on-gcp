Cecil Grace in Wright Aeroplane Startles Naval Officers at Sheerness

London April 30 The fleet of British warships anchored off Sheerness had a novel experience today when an aeroplane from the Aero Club aviation grounds as East Church  Eastchurch suddenly appeared out of the haze and manoeuvred over the vessels at varying heights After making a deliberate reconnaisance the aerial craft disappeared from view
The aeroplane which startled the navy officers is a Wright model and was piloted by Cecil Grace After leaving the harbor it flew nearly fifty miles in fiftyone minutes rising at one time to a height of 1500 feet

East Church containing the Royal Aero Clubs aviation grounds is on the Isle of Sheppey Mr Grace has been flying for some time and his operations have attracted considerable attention He uses a ShortWright biplane Last month while manoeuvring he fell from a considerable height but received only a few scratches His machine was damaged but not beyond easy repair
