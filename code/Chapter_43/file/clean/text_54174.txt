I said clearly from their understanding rightly or wrongly from verses in the Bible they arive at the date and believe to be the historical date   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that in the way of secular authorities etc   And yeah of course YOU as well as I are going around in circles because you keep rowing with one oar making me do so too in a way   I was merely answering your question which I was a little surprised why you asked it of what I meant by believedtobe historical as you seemed to think I was meaning for some reason that it was from any outside source   Thats not what I meant    As far as the theological reasons the point too is why would they be so vested if they didnt believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with    That makes no sense   Its all TIED IN was my point   And also if it was 587 instead of 607 according to the whole 2520 years view which I know you dont believe as an atheist or whatever but again from THEIR perspective wed still be living in the last days anyway  Instead of it starting in 1914 it would be 1934   So side point wed still be in the end times if thats the case    But again not to digress too much I was simply answering your question even though I thought that the discussion was already over   You were not sure what I meant by believedtobe historical date not just solely theological   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history  And because of the whole Gentile Times thing as you know of course for the whole Messiahs Kingdom breaking in for the end times etc etc    Its whatever  I was addressing your question that was it  And yes I noticed your addition in the other discussion and your contention that they mistranslated Jeremiah 2529 when they didnt because seeing other translations they say I begin or I am beginning it does NOT say what you said of already beginning   Theres no real difference between the word beginning and start of    THATS THE POINT     It says I am starting off   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God already started off   So    Because in all versions the word already is NOT there   Whether you use the word beginning or start   Also Im a little confused as to what your point is either way wheether the words are already beginning or first or starting off   Because if its already beginning as you said wouldnt that ALSO be obviously before the other nations anyway   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with before the other nations    Why would He say I am beginning with you as other versions have it which makes the point too  Also again how does your already beginning negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first   Before other nations
