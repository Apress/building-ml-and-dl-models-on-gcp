 I dispute both the method and the substance of THFTed Franks assertions He asserts that my post on the tort reform article is not related to the tort reform article It clearly is and no argument is needed for that just read it He asserts that my discussion is inappropriatea loaded word that usually refers to offensive or even actionable language none of which appear in my post but he does not explain what is inappropriate about my post he unilatery deletes it despite knowing that the neutrality of the article is disputed and despite the obvious relation of my post to the issue of neutrality and how it can be achieved in this particular article on tort reform 

THF Ted Frank accuses me of attacking other editors and declares that I will be blocked Inasmuch as I have never attacked any other editors this assertion is not true and is itself an attack and a threat I am asking for a discussion on a flagged subject on this articleneutrality and how it can be achieved To thwart that discussion is to subvert neutrality
