Hi Darkstar1st I see theyve been hounding you and a couple of newcomers in the Libertarianism page Youve stood your ground well despite the appearance that theyve blatantly misinterpreted just about every word youve written
Theres no need to ask the powersthatbe to back off Ive already been informed that the decision had already been made before my block ended to ban me from Wikipaedia at the first opportunity be it real or fictional Although for the sake of at least appearing to be objective I thought they would wait a day or two before dropping the subtlety of their witchhunt lol
