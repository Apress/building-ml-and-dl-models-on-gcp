Experimental  Prototype architecture 

I suggest that any specific designs which have not had formal evaluation should not be included as part of this article  A casual reader may be mislead into believing that they would be able to reproduce these results

see httpwwwfsecucfeduenresearchbuildingszero_energylakelandindexhtm for an example of a very strict protocol for evaluation

These examples may need further validation
