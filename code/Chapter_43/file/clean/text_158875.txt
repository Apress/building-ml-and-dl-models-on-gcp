Too technical Comment 

The maintenance template Too technical has been removed I consider large swathes of the article are too technical and incomprehensible
For instance  what on earth do these statements mean
  Tensed sentences which can neither be translated into synonymous tenseless sentences nor be given tenseless tokenreflexive truth conditions correspond if true to tensed facts

 In the absence of objective distinctions between past present and future the relations ordering events on the tenseless theory are only gratuitously regarded as genuinely temporal relations of earlierlater than
 The claim that temporal becoming is minddependent is selfdefeating since the subjective illusion of becoming involves itself an objective becoming in the contents of consciousness
 Time as it plays a role in physics is a pale abstraction of a richer metaphysical reality omitting indexical elements such as the here and the now in the interest of universalizing the formulations of natural laws
Can anyone make the article more readable and comprehensible Or are we all pretending that it makes perfect sense because were afraid to look unintelligent for not understanding it
