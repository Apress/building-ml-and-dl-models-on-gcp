And you have a point in return and a dilemma with which to grapple  But to my mind it still doesnt justify the excess length especially given the level of detail present in one section as opposed to the others  

I might also suggest that one newspaper article is proof of nothing despite some rather emphatic insistence it is  Newspapers have editorial standards and biases of their own  Consequently were left to determine the veracity of individual quotes and have no way of knowing evidence was omitted from the article in order to paint a specific picture  The implication I draw from earlier comments is that what Irvine says is not true unless hes admitting he lied and everyone else is truthful Yet even a cursory glance through the comments accompanying the article and associated material in the same publication indicates one of the other major parties involved has a pretty dicey history herself  Id say hanging the word proof on any of what you have is pretty questionable absent a second reliable source of evidence ie not another entity that has picked up and recycled the original source article
