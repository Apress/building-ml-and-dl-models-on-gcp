Mt Hope Tornado 

Although this tornado was officially an F4 Id like to suggest that the Mt Hope Alabama tornado of April 3 1974 be added to the list of possible F5 tornadoes The SPCs List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes lists it as an F5 and even the List of Super Outbreak tornadoes mentions that some sources list it as an F5 Is there any reason why it isnt in the list of possible F5 tornadoes now
