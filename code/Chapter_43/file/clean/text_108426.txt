This is your full response on my talk page including your inappropriate personal attack on me employing name calling and uncivil language 

     Instead of throwing an inappropriate tantrum on my talk page if you think the article has been deleted inappropriately why dont you read the Wikipedia instructions and WPWMD and fix the problem But repeatedly falsely accusing someone of vandalism because they used WPCSD violates WPNPA If you do it again you will be blocked THF 

 I invite comment from other editors who have been the subject of personal abuse disruption and vandalism by this editor THF also known as TedFrank Any editors wishing to comment are asked to read the entire remaining exchanges much has been deleted inappropriately by THF between me RUReady2Testify and THF  I further invite such editors to review other complaints of abuse and uncivil unilateral behavior by THF as well as the history of his contributions and deletions in light of the stated goals of his stated employer
