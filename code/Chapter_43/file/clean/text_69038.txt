First sentence 

Hi there Thanks for the edit I really appreciate you helping to improve the article
I have something to say about your edit however and I wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out

The problem sort of exists with the original too and ive been trying to think what we can do about it
See a sizable chunk of people still do know it as the alien from alien and our job is to correct those people when they look it up

Its a problem with the article I was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled if it went that way The way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name which is not ideal but neither was the way I did it

Basically it needs to say You might know this as alien but you would be wrong but in wiki language Ive hit a brick wall with how to do that Im hoping you might have some ideas for that

Do you think we could work out some nice sounding way to introduce the article a bit better than it currently does
