I wrote a large part of the article and it is closely watched by highly informed experts on the period who only use like myself RS
and you infer that I am describing myself
 as a highly informed expert  on Al Husseini
Okay I guess half the problemn is that you clearly havent a strong grasp on the English grammar and therefore do not understand often what people are writing
experts on the period who only use like myself RS means I exclude myself from being a highly informed expert on alHusseini unlike say Pluto and Zero or even Greyshark Since this is obviously the sense and you fail to see it its probable that language difficulties account for your repeated apparent refusal to see the point

Perhaps that is why you have for the third time failed to respond to both what Zero and I have asked and simply repeated your position Its no fault if you cannot understand what is asked of you in a foreign language It is a fault if you persist in reciting a set piece about what you think in the face of repeated requests for policybased arguments Its called WPIDIDNTHEARTHAT
