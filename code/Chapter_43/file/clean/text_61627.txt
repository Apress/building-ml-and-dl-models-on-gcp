Help Moria 

Hello something is bugging me about Moria and you might be able to help

The inscription on the doors reads Ennyn Durin aran Moria Pedo mellon a mino Now why would they refer to it as Moria when it didnt get called that until later 3rd age Am I wrong in assuming Moria was a later name or is it an authorial mistake
