But the first sentence of the article says

 The list is of organizations that have been proscribed as terrorist organizations by approporiate authorities including the United Nations and national governments

None of the appropriate authorities regard either RSS or VHP as a terrorist org The hrw reports linked do not even mention the word terrorist Whats with the bias Either change the first sentence to list of orgs believed to be terrorist orgs not necessarily by any governing body or put a big TotallyDisputed Tag in the section
