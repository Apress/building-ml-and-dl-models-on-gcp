Hi Ged and Elen I was pointed to the statement on Starcades page yesterday and it appeared to me that Starcades colleaguescoworkerswhatever told him to quit editing Wikipedia since his block prevented other people at his IP address from editing and they told him to post a statement on their behalf on his talk page announcing this If thats the case might autoblocking be counterproductive as no one from that IP will be able to edit I dont know that my theory is true its entirely possible its either a compromised account or hes just making the whole thing up
