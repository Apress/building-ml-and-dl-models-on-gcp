Fyi and I really dont think I should need to have to point this out my goal in this case was simply to help provide genuinely reliable information on Wikipedia in a clinically relevant topic Thats to say in the knowledge that patients really do come to Wikipedia as a source of information and that the information they find may influence their decisions However Im human and my patience has its limits Right now its seething I should say that in other circumstances I would be happy to hear your advice on how to use those templates But here Im afraid it all rings hollow Whenever did I mention a block Fwiw I might well have supported a limited topic ban if Id prioritize ANI over tidying a new article Wikipedia_talkMEDNew_article_Dutch_hypothesis Anyway I did my best and thats that And Ive got bitten for my pains But I sometimes feel thats pretty much par for the course when trying to help out on anything controversial however relevant its implications on Wikipedia A real trap imo
