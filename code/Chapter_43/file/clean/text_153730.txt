Tim  I seem to spend an enormous amount of time formatting these templates but I actually think they are really useful so Im glad to see someone else is interested One of my largest frustrations is a failure to distinguish people requested images of people from places and requested photograps of places As a photographer if I visit a city its easy for me to look through the category see which places are in need of photographing and then go out and take the photos Thats not the case with celebrities athletes or politicians from a city which Im unlikely to just run into Ive tried to create some CategoryWikipedia requested images of people from City X subcategories to clean up the base categories CategoryWikipedia requested images of City X but its a lot of work I made a WikipediaBot_requestsArchive_61Wikipedia_requested_photographs_in_X_3E_Wikipedia_requested_photographs_of_people_of_X request for a bot to do this but it didnt seem to get much support Any thoughts on this
