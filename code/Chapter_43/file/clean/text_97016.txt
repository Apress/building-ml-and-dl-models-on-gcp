Happy Town is a little town based in Newtownards Northern Ireland It was founded in 2011 and currently has a population of 200 but this is increasing everyday 

George Bartholomew Tumbledown has been the Mayor of Happy Town since the day it opened 

He is single and even though he talks a lot in public he is too afraid to talk to pretty girls when they are on their own and doesnt have a girlfriend He does fancy Nurse Milly but she doesnt know this and Mayor Tumbledown is too shy to speak to her 
As Mayor his main job is to make sure everyone is happy and smiling and smiling and happy His motto is Turn your frown upside down everyone is happy in Happy Town He wants everyone to Have a Happy Day and you can often here this being said throughout the town
Everyone is Happy Town just loves Mayor Tumbledown and he loves being their mayor He does have to be careful though as Principal Grump wants to take over the town and banish singing and dancing and make smiling illegal
Mayor Tumbledown loves resting to his parlour where he reads books by the fire with a great big mug of Coffee and a delicious hand made traybake after a long day working at the Happy town mini market He loves visiting the Happy Town football matches and having a great chat with PC Nick about the cheeky tricks Naughty Norris gets up too

Naughty Norris is a cheeky but nice primary school boy who attends Happy Town Primary His Favourite colour is red

He loves playing practical jokesespecially the older kids from Happy Town High He likes playing football but only if he wins His favourite drink is a slush puppie he has been known to drink 12 in one day but he did end up being sick in the Happy Town Library and PC Nick wasnt too impressed 
He lives with his Mum and Dad and his favourite person in the WORLD is his Auntie Nurse Milly 
He is scared of Principal Grump and never wants to go to Happy Town High if he is still the headmaster If I were Principal Grump I would be scared of Naughty Norris
He loves meeting new friends in his special Norris class on a weekday morningas he understand that friends can make Happy Town a great place to stay Happy 

Nurse Milly is the best Nurse in all of Happy Town and she just loves her jobShe often brings her nephew Norris to work with her but he likes to play tricks and hide her equipmentShe is a very good nurse and is always smiling and rumours are she even has made Principal Grump smile once But we can find no evidence of that and Principle Grump is too scary to ask
 Her favourite colour is green and will always wear green shoes 

She hasnt got time for a boyfriend although lots of boys want to be her friend and she just loves spending time making things and looking after people who are sick or have maybe lost their smile She loves to join Mayor Tumbledown and PC Nick for catch ups over Coffee and watch the girls from Happy Town high perform in their shows 

PC Nick is a great worker at Happy Town Not only does he police the streets of Happy Town but he works as the Fire Engine Driver and Customs Officer at Happy Town Airport PC Nick is such a great Police Officer that they have no crime bar the odd naughty trick Norris gets up tooThe Jail in Happy Town has never had to be used thankfully so Mayor Tumbledown has let it be used as a room for all the children to visit during their birthdays

He is single and has never been brave enough to ask out the one true love of his life the girl he fell in love with since they were in Nursery School together the lovely Nurse Milly He does really enjoy his little coffee sessions with Nurse Milly where he always gets a vanilla Latte and a Rice Krispie bun 

Principle Grump is the headmaster at Happy Town High He hates signing and dancing and often has the girls in detention when he catches them signing and dancing against his orders rumours have it that he cant sing or dance and thats why he doesnt like it but no one has been brave enough to ask him not even Mayor Tumbledown

He wants to be Mayor of Happy Town one day and then he will ban all Happiness music and dancing cancel all parties and make it illegal to smile and even make people brush their teeth everyday Mayor Tumbledown and his friends make sure every election that this will never be the case especially because great things are yet to come from Mayor Tumbledown and Happy Town 

Happy Town has just been voted best place to visit in the Worlds best Town Awards and they hope to win lots more
