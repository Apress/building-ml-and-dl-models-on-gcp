Hi Baz I know that Terrorizer is a worldwide known and very well selling magazine Im not a kid or crazy guy I just mean that if they dont know or just pretend that dont know that Lucifugum is one of the most known East European black metal bands and give them just a half of a sentence of 3 pages they dont look terribly competent in this subject Just in this subject I dont talk about their whole competence Dont you agree  As for the album a year on own label Lucifugum is a selfreleasing band just last 5 years of 15 years existence And it doesnt make them less notable than they were in past In interviews they explained their decision to make selfreleases Its just because of a disappointment in labels which didnt keep their word and promises but NOT because of lack of interest to the band Vector 33 the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum was planned to be released on Drakkar prod but  Drakkar didnt release it in due time Thats why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released Vector 33 cd by themselves It was the first Propaganda cd release Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they dont exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles By the way Stigma Egoism on Drakkar prod is not a rerelease this is the first and last at the moment cd edition of this album Propaganda released just tape version Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetalCom on cd format a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might I mean a critery for musicans Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels    
PS They record an album a year or almost a year not just now in early times they did the same things Just look at their discography they really work hard By the way my 1488 really means nothing just nothing believe you me or not Thanks for your time and all the best
