I completely disagree  If you got the feeling that she wasnt qualified it stems from the fact that the evidence appears to indicate that she wasnt qualified  That being said it is explicitly stated that she WAS qualified to pilot the aircraft in the article  I suspect your POV is blinsing you to her obvious failures and the indictment of her skills that stem from said failures
