First of all where do you get the idea that one must be an activist in order to be prochoice or to have a prochoice position on some issue  And where is the article edit where I ever said that RCOG is activist  You seem to be making arguments against a person who does not exist because I never edited any article to say that RCOG is activist

In the United States a CNN poll asked the following question in May of 2007 With respect to the abortion issue would you consider yourself to be prochoice or prolife  45 said prochoice and 50 said prolife  Do you seriously believe that those 50 are activists or consider themselves activists  I certainly dont think that  Those 50 are simply saying what their opinion is

Regarding RCOG they may well be activist  I dont know and I dont see how that is the least bit relevant to whether they are prochoice or whether they have taken a prochoice position on some issue  I suspect RCOG is activist on this issue since they oppose reduction of abortion time limits  That is a political position and not merely a matter of complying with existing law

And cant you see that I did not edit this article to say RCOG is a prochoice organization  I edited it to say that they have taken a prochoice position Cant you see the difference anymore  Youre the one who pointed out the difference in the first place
