It is extreme POV to say that someones science degree is worthless I dont know what unaccredited schools are  there are none in New Zealand
Acting as a scientist is a very subjective notion 
Since all noncreation scientists rely on the presumption of naturalism when dealing in origins nonobservational science which is not subject to the scientific method then essentially all noncreation scientists are not doing science But I will allow you to continue calling them scientists
Creation scientists with PhDs dont have to submit to mainstream dogma in order to be considered scientists they only do that sometimes to avoid being sacked
Can you point out any flawproblem with the disclaimer note itself nixon 0216 14
