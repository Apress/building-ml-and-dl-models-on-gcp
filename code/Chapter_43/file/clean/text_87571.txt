the factor of 10 issue is most propably criminal revisionism like denying holocaust actually happened one thing all the people here and everywhere else fails to take a note when comparing dresden to similar raids with firestorm is the fact that great many of the population failed to take any kind of shelter cause they thought it was just a another false alarm havent practicly ever got a real air raid to the city and what is more the lacking defences there was no or little FLAK defences and more importantly the city had no dedicated  proper air raid shelters what so ever cause resources werent spend on these because city wasnt bombed before so these people claiming 35 000 or less victims dont just have any idea what they are talking about given that the claims for 300 000 victims are propably also false but im pretty sure something like from 100 000 to 200 000 people did actually die just look at Tokyo they had a firestorm and people had no shelters and flak and other defenses were ineffective yet it is AGREED that there in single night more than 200 000 souls lost their lifes So if you want to compare bombing of dresden the caused loss of life so on to something similar compare it to Tokyo firebomb raids cause those are the only similar ones
