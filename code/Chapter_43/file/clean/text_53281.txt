Basically I agree that since there are diverse assessments in various RS on the topic of this article all statements should be sourced 
You mention a consensus theory that includes Germany along with Italy 19181945 which is something with which most people would not disagree The time frames are relevant to discussions of the leftright political spectrum characterizations etc As pointed out in Great_depressionGermany for example the Great Depression had a severe impact on the unemployment in the Weimar_republicOnset_of_the_Great_Depression facilitating the rise of the National Socialist party etc
It would seem evident that monumental disasters like the Great Depression had an effect on the ideology of Fascism and other movements as well Im sure that the sources address these issues much more thoroughly than is reflected in our article For example the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933 liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war with expansionist territorial aims against several countries In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against disenfranchised and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups 連絡 見学迷惑
