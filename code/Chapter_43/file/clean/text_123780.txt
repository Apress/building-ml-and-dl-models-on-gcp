Hi Hexagon 

Hi Hexagon Just wanted to point out to you the constant VANDALISM that is done by the user and a croatian nationalistIvan Stambuk on many of the article pages regarding South SLavic languages Srbocroatian language etc Besides vandalising some of the discussion pages where he and his mateCeha having NO ARGUMENTS to argue  constantly erase some well known facts about those topics they often argue using an offensive voice to everyone who doesnt agree with them on wikipedia It seems like Ivan Stambuk and Ceha are 2 lonely fighters for some irrational nationalistic lies about the South Slavic languages constantly fighting with the rest of the world ha ha He Ivan Stambuk is also creating some ridiculous and partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area the other half is spread through Serbia and Montenegro
httpenwikipediaorgwikiShtokavian_dialect
 or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system language at the templates featured in the articles about any of the South Slavic languages and dialects
httpenwikipediaorgwikiSerboCroatian_language

Recently he Ivan Stambuk or some of his few supporters very possibly Ante Perkovic also a cronationalist with no tie to reality  erased a recent post from a friend of mine a Croat who wrote some factual things about SerboCroatian language that Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic are unsuccessfully trying to hide or minimize on the discussion page of the article of SerboCroatian Language That malicious and pathetic behavior by these 23 users openly sends a message of hatred and separatism and it is nonacceptable on wikipedia pages 
Although they Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic have been BANNED many times ha ha We remember Youve banned Ivan Stambuk last time 2 weeks ago  it seems like theyve not learned their lesson well
Please if you can do something to stop this VANDALISM by Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic on the above mentionned wikipedia articles and discussion pages and if necessary please BAN them for a longer time so they wont damage wikipedia with their lies and misinformations Their senseless cronationalism is the last thing wikipedia and the world needs they may only keep it to their isolated circles of their fewer and fewer supporters Thank you very much and greetings to you
Best Regards 2486116250
