 Please do not attack other editors If you continue you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia    
I know youre just going to delete this Jasen but deleting warnings is considered acknowledgement of them My offer of help with use of English spelling and grammar still stands and I hope in the future youll respond constructively about criticism of your edits rather than taking the racist low road   
Ive warned you before about leaving me messages FYI I always keep my talk page blank as do many other users If you want to see the witty messages you left me in my talk history feel free to persue it and stay as long as you want to That said your opinion is neither welcome nor the least bid valid  From this point on mind your own business and save the smartalecy sincere with the demeaning undertone reply I know you are thinking up since Ill delete it before I read it per usual Have a really really great life   KABOOOOM 
Again telling me to mind my own business illustrates that you dont quite grasp that Wikipedia is a collaborative project its everybodys business I was initially concerned with your consistent spelling and grammar mistakes and writing styletone problems but I stopped because you dont seem to care and Im not going to follow you around and clean up your messes Maybe they can create a bot to do that But when you went a step further and completely misinterpreted a source twice I felt I had to say something and then you went with your racebaiting bullshit and personal attacks That might be fine for callins to sportstalkradio but it doesnt belong here Youve been warned by an admin so keep that in mind I suggest you concentrate on contributing to the project in a constructive and encyclopedic manner   

you can hereafter talk to yourself  everyone can see you are in the wrong  i did not read your message im sure i really missed out on some keys to life  darn KABOOOOM
