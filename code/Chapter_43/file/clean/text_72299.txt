You know Ive just been having this discussion on my talk page  interesting  What we currently have on project is a kind of pretribal band system which can look like any other system because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present in the bud in social bands There are some elements of tribal society developing Arbcom and administrators fill a role tribal elders in loose tribal aggregates policy and guidelines take on an almost mysticaldevotional role in some discussions but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource  Aristocracy in any sense of the term would be a superior system in Aristotles sense it would be far superior  

Ill admit that Im a huge fan of consensus systems I live for deliberative democracy but consensus systems are hard they take a lot of selfreflection a lot of selfmoderation and both a willingness and an ability to set aside small personal concerns in favor of large public concerns  These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system then we would really do better to try for another lessopen approach because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly ugly ugly beasts  Its why Aristotle considered democracy the worst form of governance because his understanding of democracy was moreorless rule by the ignorant and emotionally volatile masses  Ludwigs2
