Please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real worldwide recognised history 
 As somebody else said the nation of Transylvania DOES NOT EXIST it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians Therefore we will tell some real history here Within the chronicles of Herodotus  one may find that he described the DaciansGetae as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory including the part that is called Transylvania today which means beyond the forests after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains A more accountable map can be found here httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons665Dacia_82_BCpng  Therefore the nation living there consisted of dacians which were known as Geton plural Getae in Greek writings and as Dacus plural Daci and Getae in Roman documents The dacians were conquered after great efforts by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province Following it was  a period of Romanization period when the main Romanian people rose As an answer to the Magyar origin the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains the Hungarian people emerged by mixing with the local populations As a clear conclusion one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived called today TransilvaniaTransylvania The truth that has to be admitted is that DaciansGetae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality Moreover NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within todays Hungary territory around the 9th century AC according to Britannica as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet regionMongolia After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin dating from DacoRomans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts they should stop claiming what does not belong to them the Transylvania land PEACE
