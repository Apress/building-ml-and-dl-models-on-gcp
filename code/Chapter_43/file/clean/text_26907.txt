I deleted a para about the population numbers from the lead as there is plenty of that stuff both in the lead still and in the infobox The lead was silly as the most crucial background information about the city was simply missing I have corrected some obvious inaccuracies such as the english transliteration of Ekaterinoslav Yekaterinoslav is not based on any sources and was never used Any issue with those
