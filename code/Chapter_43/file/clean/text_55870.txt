Thanks for asking

AdultVest has a history of selfinsertion in various articles so when I saw this firm again inserted into inappropriate articles I presumed it was advertising If your sincere intention was to improve those articles then you have my apology

Your contribution to the Sex industry article seems to describe the company while shedding very little light on that articles topic As this firm seems to be an investment novelty neither representing a trend nor having its own significant influence on the industry a paragraph in that article gives this business undue weight Its a gratuitous mention regardless of the reason for the insertion This is the reason AdultVest is removed from that article

The inclusion of AdultVest in Socially responsible investing is even less relevant Obviously there are many trivial examples of investing that might be considered not socially responsible and the inclusion of AdultVest is both questionable as an illustration and violates WPNPOV in the presumption that the sex industry is particularly opposite of social responsibility The best examples are ones that need the least amount of argument that they are in fact exemplary

If you wish to contest the inclusion of numerous references to other companies in either of those articles I would recommend you take it to the article Discussion pages Your objections to those companies is not a rationale for including AdultVest I hope this makes sense and seems fair to you Ive linked relevant Wikipedia policies where I think it might make things clear
