Yes I too find it upsetting that the bands management has systematically taken down past reliable sources about Tyler Gurwicz However as it is they are management I dont want to get into any legal trouble with them or anything 

Heres the way I see it its very hard for a rock band to make it these days I imagine theyll release a record it probably wont sell very well theyll get dropped fromt their management and then they wont care about the page anymore and then the truth can be readded provided there are still sources left

If you do continue to persue this continue to stress that management editing the article is definitely a WPCOI problem  msg me
