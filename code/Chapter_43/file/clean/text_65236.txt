I remember reading about some hominoid cryptid 12 feet tall that is supposed to roam about in Washinton DC so there is a small possibility that this could be a related misspelled critter And I think I vaguely recall some cryptid that started with an Eth sound though I dont think it was a hominoid type Still it seems that every state has 10 or 11 local names for these things and obviously they dont all deserve an article The Penthcothian bit is obvious nonsense but Ive seen nonsense just as bad in other cryptozoology stubs Its a pretty sad article but I wanted to give it a chance which is what the 5 days allowed by proposed deletion will do
