When a numbered IP starts screwing with your article you revert him End of story Everyone will back you up on that Esecially since youre never supposed to delete sourcing from an article Because people who do that put the article author in the situation youre in now
Im just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WPs guidelines However because the people whove made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job writing articles that read like spam not following Wikipedias standard format weve now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt  thats where they salt the earth so the article can never again be created
And meanwhile once this artilce is deleted Sean Kennedyll be spending another 6 months being all whiney and snitty about Wikipedia again I wont be able to listen to him 
Ultimately to reach your goal it doesnt matter whats right and wrong here What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that youve followed the rules that your article is as good as any others and that its as wellsourced as any others If youve been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles Thats an article I rescued from AfD The article used to ages ago be quite frankly stupid Its about a supposed Satanic cult of which theres only 1 confirmed member But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more I managed to get the article accepted  by following the rules Its the only real article Ive ever worked on and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch If I can make that article acceptable you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable The problem is youre almost out of time  you can completely repair an article during AfD and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote But youd have to start now
