I have to apologize  with 24 hours I assumed edits made in the course of one day so I only looked at the day of the month  I will be more careful in the future  It would help if there were some warning notification by Wikipedia whenever someone reverts something for the 4th time inside 24 hours I would think this would be a very simple check to implement programatically and would prevent mistakes like this from happening
