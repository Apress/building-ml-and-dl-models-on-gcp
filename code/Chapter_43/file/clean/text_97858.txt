Russia Today Forums 

Ive been reading RT Forums ever since Ive got embezzelled in the Battle of Title and although I found little there to support my arguments I did find quite a lot of people while critiquing RTs Coverage calling RTs Forums truly Democratic Ive also heard others complaining that their articles werent being published or were heavily edited yet these claims were actually published on RT Forums Any idea on how to put that into the article Should I try to write an article on the forums just to see if it works Anyone want to experiment
