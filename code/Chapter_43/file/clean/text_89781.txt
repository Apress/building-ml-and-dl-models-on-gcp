Who are you kidding Youre not here to check up on my appeals You and your friends are bstalking my pageb Thats why Baseball Bugs responded less than an hour after I wondered about whether or not some people here get paid to keep a certain slant on this website And thats why you conveniently happened to be checking here after some Jewish troll stopped by Heck one of you probably sent that Jewish troll here in the hopes that I would give an incriminating response
The link I posted was in response to his claims that because Jesus is Jewish I should be one or whatever it was he said Just because I post that doesnt mean Im antiSemitic a ridiculous slur and doesnt mean I agree with everything on their website In case you havent noticed I work on Catholic articles and thats a Protestant website
