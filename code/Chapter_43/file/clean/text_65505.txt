Still no academic gain with DIREKTOR
I would love to see DIREKTOR fight against someone wishing to add war criminal to the biography of his ever beloved communist totalitarian dictator locksmith tito The mere idea that Yugoslav is listed as Dr Pavelics nationality is a laughing matter considering that Dr Pavelic was one of the most notable antiyugoslavs that ever lived Of course there is no space for logic on wikipedia just hundereds of ageold sources that have proved wrong time in and again but continually used by DIREKTOR to push his political agenda on wikipedia  and he is paid to do so
