Im pretty sure that its fine if the rates are understood to be per year or some other finite period as is usually the case in economics  After a year in the bank an amount of money M becomes M1i where i is the nominal interest rate  You can also write this as M1r1p where r is the real interest rate and p is the rate of inflation  Then you get the first equality for r  It reduces to i  p when p is small or if the rates are measured instantaneously something that probably only a mathematicians would do
