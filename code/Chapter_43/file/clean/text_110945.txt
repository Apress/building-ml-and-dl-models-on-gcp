kd lang Image reomval 

Please can you initate a discussion on the page before removing images form the pages an you also provide an alternative under fair use to illustarte the person in question rather than blanket removing the image of the artist In future considerate discussion on the talk page would be a better way to go about this as the image had been opn ther page soem time and nobosy else viewed it as a fair use infringment It also allows people enough time to find a replacemenbt image for the fair use infringment
