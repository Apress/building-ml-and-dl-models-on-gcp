I think the reference for NWOBHM should be used instead being things like WASP and other styles of metal could come got mind where as NWOBHM narrows the focus to the raw aggressive sounds associated with that scene rather that early metal itself  though it can be said Led Zeppelin and others power have had an influence on the early punk and hardcore punk musicians  MWOBHM seems to be more appropriate 683915245
