Jeppiz you and I may have got off to a bad start but I am more than willing to discuss things with you This is however provided that you refrain from comments and snide criticism such as the one above where you say Alasdairs argument about Rummel is not particularly strong He accuses Rummel of being a bad researcher but I tend to place more trust in a distinguished professor in history than an anonymous Wikipedia user I suggest you strike that as I nowhere do I accuse Rummel of being a bad researcher What I did was to quote Tomislav DuliÄ‡ from the Uppsala Programme for Holocaust and Genocide Studies Uppsala University who wrote that the estimates used by Rummel for Titos Yugoslavia cannot be relied upon since they are largely based on hearsay and unscholarly claims frequently made by highly biased authors Please strike your remarks and be more careful in future
