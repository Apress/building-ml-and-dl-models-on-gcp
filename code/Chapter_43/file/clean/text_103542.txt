Relations with clubs owners networks 

Throughout the biography some of the business relations should be clarified I have marked some locations with hidden comments
If club president MacPhail hired Barber in Cincinnati why mention the new owner Crosley at all 
Did the Cincinati Brooklyn and New York ballclubs all hire the broadcast personnel or hire Barber in particular throughout his career When Barber took a regular network job was he an employee of the network and a local station or of the network and a ballclub Alternatively is it conventional wisdom about sports broadcasting history that the clubs covertly ruled their broadcast partners For that we should have a citation 
Also throughout his career did the networks routinely hire for the World Series the regular broadcast personnel of the participating teams
