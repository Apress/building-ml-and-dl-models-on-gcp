Regarding Loyalmoonie and LGBT categories 

Looked into it and this editor seems to be pushing an antiLGBT agenda Theyve done similar stuff over at Sailor Moon and made officiallooking warnings to other editors This quote is bizarre and is quite telling To insert those categories would ultimately give other people who may not even support the LGBT movement reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy Sailor Moon is a homosexual andor supports SSM I dont personally watchread Sailor Moon or know much about it so Im not confident enough to readd the categories but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless and there is a sourced part in the article about female homosexualitytalk
