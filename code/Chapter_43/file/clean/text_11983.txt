Summer of Love 

Reversions reverted again and reported again

A I am not new to Wikipedia I have been editing articles for over ten years now

B I am an accomplished music and entertainment author currently 72 years old and recently celebrated by 50th year in the field

C I find it effronterous to come back after working on a page for two days straight to find it all erased by people who were either A not born when the events took place or B not having been to either one or both as I have been

D Numerous administrative forums within Wikipedia state that any article heretofore deemed as dry and stodgysounding may be rewritten into a more chatty style in order to appeal to a wider audience

The page in question has already been reported to the administration for Page Protection as well as under Edit Wars

Further interference will also be reverted and reported as well
