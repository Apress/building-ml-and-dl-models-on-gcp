Deletion of Match Attax  

According to httpenwikipediaorgwikiTopps 
Match Attax the official Premier League trading card game is the biggest selling boys collectable in the UK two years running Being sold across the globe in a number of countries the collection also holds the title of the biggest selling sports collectable in the world It is estimated that around 15 million children collect it in the UK and 25 million children in the world

Assuming these figuresa accurate basically you are saying that something of great interest to  25 million children including my 5 and 6 year old boys is suitable for deletion from wikipedia
