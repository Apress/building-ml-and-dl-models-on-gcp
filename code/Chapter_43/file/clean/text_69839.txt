Trusliver I was quite disturbed to see that you carelessly erased large sections of my work without any discussion with me beforehand Among other things I had been adding large numbers of new references to the Freddie Mercury page As your carelessness here has cost me about 20 mintues of my time there is no doubt that YOU are acting as the vicious vandal here I recommend that you discuss major edits with others before making them Moreover I hope that you will refrain from making further edits until I am finished tonight
