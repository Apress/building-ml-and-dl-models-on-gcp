The fact that she does not seem to be especially knowledgeable about Alex Jones is of some significance and the fact that she had made an edit to the page at some point in the past does not really refute that contention since part of the criticism is that she makes edits to pages on subjects she does not know much about A more interesting question is why you brought it up since it was a complete nonsequitur at that point in the discussion thread Regardless the material was not either unsourced or poorly sourced It was sourced to a reliable professional print publication which would without question have been sued by Jones had it published any falsehoods The section on deletion reads Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified if this is not possible then it should be removed If the entire page is substantially of poor quality 
Id say the first sentence there is without question referring to deletions other than page deletions since the second sentence by saying if the entire page implies that the previous sentence did not refer to the entire page
