Kim I think you owe me an apology for the sheer amount of time wasted here Secondly I strongly disagree with your nonsensical threat of ban over adding an NPOV tag to the article as the article has a long history of discussion of bias and lack of neutrality in the article even prior to my recent threads and subsequent mass agreement that the article is not neutralmaking the tag entirely appropriate However given the amount of time youve already wasted of mine over this nonsense Im not going to put myself in a place where you can slap me with another attempt at a 48 hour ban and require me to write up another block request What a ridiculous situation
