The scaled articles section on the PlayStation project page has a new rule Each article on the scaled articles list now has a group leader the person who put that article on that list However a user can only be a group leader for one article This means that I can no longer be group leader for all three Crash Bandicoot articles on the list With that new rule in mind I have chosen the original Crash Bandicoot article as the article that Ill be group leader of You put your name down for those three articles and I was wondering if you would like to be group leader of either Crash Bandicoot 2 or 3 Remember you can only take one The one that you dont choose will be removed from the list until I am finished editing the original Crash Bandicoot I hope to be hearing from you sometime during the week  

Thanks
