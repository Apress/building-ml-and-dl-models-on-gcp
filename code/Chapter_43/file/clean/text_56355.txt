Same thing goes for Madonnas biggest number one hit 

This was changed from Like a Virgin cited in a specific Billboard article to Take a Bow

Billboard does not consider the most weeks at number one as the sole determinant as to a biggest hit  They look at the entire chart run

I want to change this back but want some feedback before I do that it wont happen again  dnsla23
