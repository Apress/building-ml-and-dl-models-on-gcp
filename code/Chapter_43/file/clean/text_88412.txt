Fixing the article 

Ill propose below for comment a couple of alternative ways to proceed to fix No Gun Ri Massacre But first 

The recent interest shown by   and now  presents a real opportunity to improve the article and bring it back to high WP standards In the past couple of years new sources have been published and there have been new developments including a more settled estimate of the dead from South Korean authorities They belong in the article

But it will be a demanding task theres a hell of a lot wrong here And most of all to fall back on a clich√© its essential not to lose sight of the forest for the trees One big forest clearly is the wayoutofline behavior of WeldNeck not just at No Gun Ri Massacre but Wikipediawide as evidenced by the repeated warnings from other contributors including many he simply deleted from his Talk page as with s editwarring warning at  and including s observation  that he has engaged in POV pushing on all the articles you have edited As said one must go back in his Talk history to find the thousands of illicitly deleted bytes Then recall his outrageous action of just two days ago killing my posting here at NGR Talk and his taunting have fun with this when he posted his frivolous bid for a topic ban at ANI When you combine all this with his dozens and dozens of rapidfire unjustified unexplained reverts at No Gun Ri Massacre I think it should be clear this is a guy who cannot be trusted on anything

The trees the distractions are the red herrings that WeldNeck and other denialists wave on No Gun Ri Before WeldNeck there was an NGR denialist going by Kauffner who got banned for general mayhem around WP The denialists arose in the year 2000 grasping at anything to attack those whose research work exposed No Gun Ri and thereby made the US Army look less than saintly One of their problems along with their blinding anger and their obtuseness about so many things is that theyre stuck in the year 2000 

Since then after long investigations the South Korean and US governments confirmed that the US military killed the trapped refugees at NGR by the effects of smallarms fire artillery and mortar fire and strafing it emerged that more than a dozen military documents showing orders to shoot civilians were suppressed in the US investigation a Harvard historian reported in 2005 the discovery of a US ambassadorial letter to the State Department warning on the day the NGR killings began that the Army had decided to shoot approaching South Korean refugees another suppressed document other media organizations including the BBC replicated and then advanced the NGR story beyond the original reporting a government committee led by South Koreas prime minister certified a minimal death toll with identified victims and the government built a large memorial park and museum at the site where the facts of NGR are enshrined in exhibits and informational material and where a new consensus death toll is accepted This is the forest to keep in mind

Other knowledgeable journalists and academics have looked to me to maintain integrity on this subject in WP and elsewhere as a retiree with more time available to learn WPs basics and monitor things But they and I literally havent had the stomach even to read the article for many months so disgusted were we at the way one outofcontrol guy was allowed to run roughshod over the truth not to mention turn it at times into a semiliterate illogical mess Ill swallow hard and read it now

A couple of possible ways to deal with this problem

TimothyJosephWood admirably was willing to dig right in yesterday He started from the top of my litany of WeldNecks unjustified reverts a list done months ago but never posted until two days ago and it turned out that first revert a minor matter had been remedied since I first noted it A possible solution Ill compare my two lengthy lists of problems from late 2013 and late 2014 and update them into one that lists problems that still exist And Mr Wood or others could then work from that That might take me one day to prepare

Alternatively I myself could begin making edits and other interested parties could stand by and observe the reaction and ask for better explanations from me or whatever In that case I might as well also assemble some of the new material and sourcing I refer to to include new external links etc That might take me u
