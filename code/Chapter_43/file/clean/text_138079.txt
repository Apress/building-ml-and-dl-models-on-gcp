Oobi started in 2004 
A month ago On the list of episodes I saw that someone put the airdate January 1 2004 for Dance Oobis first episode I know that this is not true because even TVGuidecom states it premiered April 7 2003 I am pretty sure whatever website said it started on January 1 2004 is obviously not a reliable source So did it start in 2003 or 2004 7164646
