Hm I now get the tabs But for example the complete tab says httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaRequests_for_checkuserCaseBeatle_Fab_Four clicking on it doesnt seem to do anything at all When I edit the page the message tab is there with httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleWikipediaRequests_for_checkuserCaseBeatle_Fab_Fouractionedit and also seems to do nothing Amazing isnt it I work as a programmer for close to 30 years retire and my programmer brain says uh uh no way you cant pay me to do that anymore
