Landon I clearly showed earlier that those were four separate edits Do you want me to show you again 
First revision
Shows revert to past edit meaning separate from the other reverts without discussion This does not count in 3RR because it is entirely separate from the other edits AS IVE STATED
Second revision
After looking over the edits I cleaned up the Rolling Stone source but removed the link to the unreliable source Muze
Third revision
Reverts to second revision
Fourth revision
Second revert
I also showed that you also showed bias in reverting sourced content and claiming that I had made the edits even though I have absolutely no ability to do so Please do not make another reply to this talk page I have repeatedly proven my points but the fact that you choose not to listen proves that this conversation is going nowhere I am in the process of gaining administrative help in not only preventing the both of you from harassing me like this but also in overturning your ridiculous biased sockpuppet investigation Have a good life
