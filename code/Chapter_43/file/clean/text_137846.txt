hello 

I dont know what you have against me  I suppose it is easy to be cold and harsh over a keyboardmonitor  I never wanted anything but cultural fairness on these pages and compromise  The aggressiveness and one sidedness of people like Gryffindor and noclador has always been offensive to me what can I say  At least some of you German speakers have to realize that by moving the Province of BolzanoBozen to just South Tyrol on English Wikipedia is just emphasizing a German point of view and only a German point of view  You really can not say that South Tyrol is the major English usage  It just isnt  Alto Adige is also used very often in the Unites States almost entirely  The name of the page itself is taken from Brittanica  Even on the Bolzano provincial website one of the English documents says Province of Bolzano  Look you guys can do anything you want  If you change it to South Tyrol I hope it really makes all of you finally happy with your lives  I actually feel very sorry to see people in Europe still get so deeply ingrained in these ethnic politics  The attitude and aggressive behavior I see coming from German speakers especially German speakers in BZ reminds me more of what you see in Yugoslavia  It really isnt that far from the we are victims attitude before the World Wars Im sorry if that is being blunt
