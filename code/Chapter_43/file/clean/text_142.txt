Are you being facetious if not you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk then I will only be too glad to provide You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me in regards to which words youre claiming are offesive perhaps WPAssume good faith

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines WPHARASS is just one For example the removal of third party references from articles which dont suit their POV without entering an edit summary considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WPBLANK The violation of WPNEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with despite being made aware of the policy despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term  The same tag team practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties not just against me Again if you would like evidence just ask

It would seem however looking at the messages on your talkpage above especially the lovely intertude under UK mediation section that Jza messaged you somebody he seems very familiar with in violation of WPCANVAS Specifically the section on WikipediaCANVASCampaigning may interest you If youre going to be an admin may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message Rather than accusing me a user who is being cyberstalked of personal attacks Systematic bias is not acceptable youre here to make sure that our policies are upheld not to chip in for the sake of a friend Thanks
