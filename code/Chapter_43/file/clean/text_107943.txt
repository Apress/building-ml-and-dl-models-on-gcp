Website display 

Im just curious especially because Ive been seeing several editors doing this but why would you change Evanescencecom to wwwEvanescencecom as you did here when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing   t  c 

The infobox doc has the standard format as wwwexamplecom and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to wwwevcom so I followed that pattern as well  Also as you mentioned most other pages have the www on there as well Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the www subdomain it redirects to it with the www anyway  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website as I have just verified  I was really just looking for consistency though  Since the Ev pages all had www listed I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same  I agree that Evanescencecom looks better  However all official channels such as their official twitter page as well as Amy Lees official twitter page the official youtube page and even the WindUp records website links to wwwEvanescencecom I believe that we should follow suit   Scott M Howard  Talk   

Okay thats fine For most any modern website the www is almost completely redundant and I personally loath such things but it really makes no difference for our purposes here The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that standard since IIRC http and https could technically direct viewers to two different websites so why not require that part as well Feels like overstandardisation   t  c 

I just figure consistency throughout Evanescence is best  If thats how they advertise themselves I guess thats how we should  On the subject of www I agree that its completely redundant  The only reason it exists seems to be out of habit lol  It even sounds stupid on radio or TV when people are advertising their sites Go to doubleyou doubleyou doubleyou dot  Got a studder pal  I dunno  It sorta goes with my want to use metric in the united states but we know THAT will probably never change as a standard either ah well D   Scott M Howard  Talk   

Indeed Why oh why cant we just switch to metric Im not sure what you mean by advertise You mean how the site is presented by the group in other media I dont really understand how that is relevant to how it should be displayed by anyone else but all thats irrelevant D   t  c
