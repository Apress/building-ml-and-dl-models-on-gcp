New User 

Hello Gogo Dodo

I am a new user on wikipedia and just wanted to ask if my new page could be removed from the deletion list  My new page is Kaburst and i still have a lot i want to do with it  I think the reason it was considered is because it starts off like it should be in wiktionary  but yeah just give me some time to make it better

Thanks
