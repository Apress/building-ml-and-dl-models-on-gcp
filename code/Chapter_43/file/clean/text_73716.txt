Links 

Ive removed a majority of the links from the law page but I think it to explain why First this page is about the general concept of law as a social construct it is not about the particular law of any country and so it should not have country specific links Those links should be put in the article of the laws of the particular country not here Second the page is not indended to be a repository of useful law links So just because it was useful useful site does not warrant inclusion Rather a link should aid in the understanding of the content of the article most of them did not The proliferation of legal dictionaries news websites lawyer indices and other such websites was getting out of control There is no shortage of these sorts of websites on the internet and none of them are all that distinguishable or authoritative There was really no good reason to have them
