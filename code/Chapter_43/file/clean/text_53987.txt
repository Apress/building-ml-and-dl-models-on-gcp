All Im saying is we shud try to do things to make this article more popular and bc Megan Fox is currently considered the sexiest woman on the planet except for her thumbs which are all fucked up we should add her picture to the article so that more people will read the article and then they will be educated in the field of brachydactyly and they will learn how to avoid catching brachydactyly because an ounce of preention is worth over 100 dollars and Wikipedia will become a better place as a result  but i will not add her picture to the article without first seeking consensus but i will try forum shopping if that doesnt work  pls email me with any questions because i dont log onto wikipedia except to read about articles thx
