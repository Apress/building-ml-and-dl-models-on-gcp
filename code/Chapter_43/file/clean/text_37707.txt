It would seem a bit excessive to me and i think someone in the discussions i linked to also thought so but who knows As long as webcitationorg is only archiving text and not photosvideo i dont know about the latter given that Terabyte hard disks will become normal within the next year or so it wouldnt put much additional pressure on internetcomputer resources to do this collectively for all wikipedians for a few hundred million cites and store it on just one single hard disk Personally ill probably just try and see You can probably make a mental note or note on your user page which journals have a habit of being volatile Online newspapers from places with relatively weak internet access and less developed internetGNUlinux communities eg Iraq probably might be volatile in the sense that after a few years they will change softwarehostingURLs or go offline for whatever reason Another point is that webcitationorg probably doesnt yet have a long term reputation archiveorg and arxivorg have been around for a long time arxivorg has very solid institutional backing and a huge amount of mirroring In any case i dont see why anyone could complain if you archived every cited reference
