The definition of injury certainly comes into play I happen to have FOP My jaw fused likely due to a dental procedure My knee which happened AFTER my jaw was due to an incident in Hawaii involving a minibus with a rental car company My right leg is now going through an episode that does not correlate with any remembered injury or strain steve 527
