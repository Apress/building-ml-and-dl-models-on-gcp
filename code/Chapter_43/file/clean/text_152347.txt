I asked you to prove you cant appeal an ITN decision not whether you had ever seen it done or not The appeal venue is obviously the talk page or I suppose the talk page of the person who made the decision I went to the talk page and nobody said I couldnt appeal they just rejected it out of hand If I contravened the no appeal rule theyre certainly being very coy about it And quite obviously it doesnt take 7 days to figure out if a decision was wrong  and in case you hadnt noticed 4 days later and Gerry Adams is still under arrest and its still in the news so even in this case Im sure if Wikipedia wasnt such a dysfunctional place the veracity of the original decision could have been examined exhaustively by now But no you all seem to prefer to handle it quite differently  prefering to talk endless rubbish about sticks and horses and telling people they dont understand things things that youre all not even prepared to answer a few simple questions about Some collaboration   2139
