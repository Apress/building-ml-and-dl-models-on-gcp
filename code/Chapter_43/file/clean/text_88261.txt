Selfhating Jew is with very rare exception used as an epithet only It is very rarely used to legitimately describe an actual condition I can cite thousands of instances of its use as an epithet I suspect that one would be hardpressed to come up with even a dozen examples of its legitimate use Jfdwolff changed the introduction to include the word epithet so maybe NPOV is not what you think it is in this case
I understand that there is a history of Jews hiding or otherwise denying or betraying their ethnicityreligion But selfhating Jew is hardly a sympathetic term to describe such a person Even by Prof Gilmans position as given in the article the term arose out of a dispute between different Jewish groups an epithet If you met someone who was genuinely distressed about his Jewish identity to the point that he tried to hide or deny it would you call him a selfhating Jew I think that would be very cruel something worse even than calling a handicapped person a cripple
I also believe that most reasonable people would agree that your revert was belligerent and blind given complete information And I think describing someones edit as POVing as you did is fairly characterized as a personal attack
Other than a few editors connected in various ways with you I have had little trouble getting cooperation from anyone on Wikipedia but thank you for your advice
