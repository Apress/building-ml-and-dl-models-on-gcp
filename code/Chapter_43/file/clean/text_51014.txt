What do you mean the source isnt verifiable  Im waiting on a copy from the library  Unless youre proposing that the material simply isnt in the book at all which seems unlikely it is most certainly verifiable going to have to refer you back to wpv  The citation needs to be completed for that one you can see wpcite  You first brought this issue up on Saturday and as soon as I have the book in hand I will complete the citation but I dont think any of us are going to spend 50 to get the book overnight simply to see you move on to another straw man  userJ aka justen talk
