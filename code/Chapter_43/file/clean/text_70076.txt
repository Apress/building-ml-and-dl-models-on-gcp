Asking users to contact you privately 

Dear editor at 8475133108 You are currently as you have done in the past contacting users in particular administrators asking them to email you privately about something I do not know what you wish to talk about but I can assure you that there is probably a better way to accomplish whatever it is that you wish to accomplish In particular if you have a legal concern about your personal information on any Wikipedia article please contact the OTRS team as per WikipediaBLPEDITLegal_issues If you are being harassed in some manner please see WikipediaHarassment for advice If its a research project read WikipediaResearch recruitment If its a copyright problem please follow the directions at WikipediaCopyright_violationsInformation_for_copyright_owners I cant really think of too many other problems that are better handled offwiki and privately Please be aware of our guidelines against canvassing which is wikislang for trying to gather support for some particular topic If people do contact you please read WPEMAILPOST to know our stance about the privacy of their emails Be aware that by posting your email address you are giving away your private information Deleting it from users talk pages as you keep asking of editors does not not remove that information from public view Lastly if its something entirely different than Ive anticipated theres still almost surely a better way to handle it Search Wikipedia with wiselychosen keywords to find it
