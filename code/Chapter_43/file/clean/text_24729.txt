please stop threatening youre throwing weight around in a way that mixes your admin power with that of a user elevating your opinion above that of others you have no right to do so do you think youre better than me if so youre wrong please stop addressing me as a child because youre an admin when i freely unilaterally removed the entire expose of OWB as a plagiarist was it relevant to the article and important to post temporarily it absolutely was because he was attempting to use his external article to gain POV power and he has been about as disruptive to the article as anybody could be that he still claims he didnt claim a single sentence of the article as his own work shows quite clearly what youre dealing with however because hes not an overt vandal his hand is held indefinitely enough

have you considered the damage done by treating two different people as equally at fault in a given situation i have noticed this before from you directly katefan and id appreciate it very much if you would at least examine it once more if you have already the result is the discouragement of wikipedias biggest asset editors who leave material that will last i am not your inferior so please dont treat me as such if you want to spend hours creating and encouraging editors who bring us things such as this with a dedication page no less then IMO youre misguided in any case i doubt quite strongly that you realize the effect of blasting into a situation announcing however subtly youre an admin and then acting as though youre just there to edit that is not how it works whether you realize it your introductions are often launched to establish passiveaggressive superiority ill say it again you are not my superior you have admin power here and are not a better editor than i am please halt with the admin intimidation for issues that if intervention were to be helpful require the intervention of somebody who at least acts sincerely as an equal not a parent why is that so difficult for admins to understand i know why but maybe you can give it a think

if you doubt the subtle influence of your position as an admin look no further than OWBs obsequiousness on your talk page users know what the score is im not going to play and ive demonstrated repeatedly that my article editing here at wikipedia is in the top layer im quite aware that many dont agree with my philosophy of human action and wikipedias future ie that encouraging disrupters and discouraging producers is a vacant policy but im going to push it as far as it will go it my theory begins by refusing to allow vandalistic interference in my comments thats not necessarily something you couldnt support katefan you know good editors could use the support of admins  far from the blitz onto the scene method where habitual disrupters and habitually superior editors are then treated as equal entities with fresh start mantras no its not the first time ive seen that from you katefan and an everybodys contributing equally approach that does nothing but swat the hands of editors whove fought sometimes alone and for days to preserve article integrity doesnt work with children nor with adults youre treating as children the presumption of theoretical equality of action when arriving on the scene is probably the biggest mistake admins make here

yes my objection to your fresh start approach on the BC discussion page is quite serious i dont believe that you should continue further in the facade of being an objective normal editor on the page you have set yourself up as everybodys superior and such an approach was not necessary why not let things sort themselves out a bit did you notice i bowed out after removing hundreds of my words did you notice that things were slowly improving without you did you notice that somebody else wouldnt bow out did you notice that i didnt immediately gut his atrocious frank hamer article as would have been well within the bounds of wikipedia policy if not why are you even pretending to help there are healthier methods of dispute resolution than dispute denial they may not seem as touchyfeely at first but the results are longer lasting and ultimately far more respectful OWB needed to face what he faced there and wikipedia and OWB will be better off if this process isnt pretended away you said something about i dont know what went on with you two really all that went on was utterly public ive had no private comm with OWB so if you dont know what went on then you didnt pay attention if youre not paying attention maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily

i doubt what ive written here will make any difference but i figu
