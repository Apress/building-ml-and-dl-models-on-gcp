Way I see it people who say the Sherman is a very good tank are seriously overestimating it I mean come on it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank it was manufactured in limited quantities 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities had a mechanical reliability that beat the T34 and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyrostabiliser

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it Once a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank The Tiger shot at the building and the shell went right through and penetrated the Shermans turret There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot Also do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull Those are efforts to help augment the armour of the Sherman
