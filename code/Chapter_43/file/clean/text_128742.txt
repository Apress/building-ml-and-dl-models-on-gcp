Seeking Editor Review Commentary If You Like 

Hi  In conjunction with my RfA that you voted on I have created an editor review to give people a chance to comment as to ways in which I can branch out or alter my contributions to Wikipedia  An RfA seems to solely focus on how ones temperment and contributions relate to how they might handle administrative powers and the consensus on that seems to be that Im not quite ready the editor review opens things up a little more to a larger focus and Id love to hear community feedback in the sense of that larger focus too  If you feel youve already expressed yourself sufficiently when casting your vote then by all means dont worry about it but if any thoughts come to mind or if youd like to expound upon any suggestions or commentary it would be appreciated  In any case I appreciated you taking the time to express your opinion on my RfA and I thank you for that    talk  contribs
