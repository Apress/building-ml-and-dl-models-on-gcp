Well Im not going to get into an edit war over it However out of interest I checked 22 other bios on similar individuals All were culled from links here School massacre Three of twentytwo mentioned ethnicity Two of twentytwo mentioned religious affiliation of some sort Zero of twentytwo mentioned both ethnicity and religion So I suppose there is some sort of precedent although it doesnt seem to be applied evenly Im not sure what valuable knowledge is imparted by providing information about the religious affiliations of someones parents I could see it if there was a link established between this and his crime but I dont see that at all
