Movies are Canon Take the Garlic Junior saga for example Onio is only a joke There are other parodies that have other super saiyans in it Onio is more of a fan work done by Toriyama than an actual creation Movies are part of the dragonball series Onio should be removed He doesnt match the dragonball continuity Goku appeared in Robot Chicken but I dont hear you arguing about it Lets just stick with the anime movies and dragonball series manga
