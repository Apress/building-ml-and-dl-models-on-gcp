Thanks Not so coincidentally its really hard to respond effectively without the ability to post on ANI but the short version is that nothing has changed since the last time these very same editors tried to get rid of me They just saw an opportunity after engineering the block
As with Roccos twoweek marathon of persecution we already know in advance that the Cloud will vote to get rid of me under any circumstances its their game and Im a piece of the wrong color So far TFD has perjured himself shamelessly not just the part where he denies that all of our sources recognize Geller as rightwing but the whole false narrative woven out of random diffs that nobody thinks to check for themselves Id like to be able to say Im surprised or disappointed but this has happened too many times already
It really comes down to whether the community has the will to oppose them If not then it gets what it deserves more articles owned by the Cloud fewer editors willing to contribute their free time If we forcibly recused every member of the Cloud the report against me would evaporate   
PS
Lets see how this response gets misquoted against me
