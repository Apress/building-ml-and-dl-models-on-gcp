IMDb Trivia 

I was reviewing upcoming Featured Articles and I was appalled to see that the Internet Movie Database was cited in four different departments in this Featured Article  IMDb is a guarded wiki in which users submit information which may or may not be accepted  The most lenient feature is the trivia page which completely violates Wikipedias verifiability policy in not coming from a reliable source  I strongly suggest purging direct usage of IMDb in this Featured Article its only merit is as an external link  talk  contrib
