Scientific analysis and historicofficial data used by foreign authors when writing about SK  

Hello I am back I know a couple of you missed me Has anyone found any proof of Spiro Koleka meaning also the Koleka clan to be Greek If this is the case please share Any unscientific claims by Pettifer or authors referring to him in their books bibliographies are excluded So far the problem is identified with Pettifer so we put him aside and treat him and the authors pointing at him separately To the Greek editors here please use your own state archives to find where the Kolekas live in Greece and when did they live there Or find their properties there or some house a single grave a single piece of paper written in Greek by anyone of them Or find when did they last leave from Greece please or how many wereare they I want to know Find some church records in Albania or Greece get some proof so you can save face and make me shut up How difficult can it be to find something Greek in this important man How come all his children never left any Greek notes somewhere or are not part of some Greek facebook group How come Spiros daughter writes poetry books and articles in Albanian and not  single one in modern Greek language Is this family really ashamed to be Greek or is it just drumroll not greek How about you Zoupan and Alexikoua for once be not so sure about yourselves How about some critical thinking applied in this article I challenge the scientific and historic foundation of your sources
