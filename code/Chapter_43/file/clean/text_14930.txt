I think youre confused in regards to the definition of state I see that you live in California United States which furthers my assumptions There is more to the word state than the US state eg Texas Missouri etc definition a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada or Serbia or Cambodia With this definition China Philippines and Japan are states The terms state nation and country refer to concepts which may be similar however still have their small distinctions In order to avoid ambiguity its better to refer to objects such as China Japan Britain Russia the United States France et cetera as sovereign states instead of the two alternative terms A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contextsI wouldnt put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue The Chinese language like all languages has its limitations in that there is no onetoone correspondence with English political vocabulary The English words state nation and country are all translated as 國 in Chinese as Chinese does not make such a distinction The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called 中華民國國防部 國  nation the United Nations is called 聯合國 國  nation the United States Department of State is called 美國國務院 國  state the Commonwealth of Independent States is called 獨立國家聯合體 國  state  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called 石油輸出國組織 國  country TCE
