recent work 

I have some complaints about the history and reason section In my view it should be two different sections the content is very vague and is more based on short term assumptions rather than logical conclusions The next point is that i fear when the article is more based on long texts the reader doesnt want to read it it should contain more passages and listings Furthermor i dont like the new picture at the start of the article When a reader gets to the site he doesnt expect a painting or comic style picture Even if it has an artistic background i dont like it it belittles in my view the entire issue I believe that most of the readers would get provoked when they see that such an horrible act is described over a painted picture These are just my thoughts when i see the recent edits on the article
