there is no such thing as Mongolia region Mongolia has been a country throughout the history inhabitted by mainly Mongols along with others but never Chinese until recent The country has been divided in recent history into several pieces due to 1 Manchu invasion 2 Russian expansion and Chinese imperialism 3 Spread of communism

Not only the term and concept of Mongolia region are fabricated this article here along with the Inner Mongolia article especially the history part are largely Communist Chinese government Those who I believe they are Chinese if not government agent should immediately stop doing this and the Wikipedia management should take some actions to stop this chauvinistic plots
