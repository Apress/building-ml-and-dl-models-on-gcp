Brazil 

This article mentions that Sam Lowry of Brazil humslistens tosings the films selftitled theme song but Im not sure if thats metafictional  The song is not named after the film rather the film was named after the song  I dont think that this characters attraction to that song is at all related to any sort of idea of him being a character in a film 706124731   Mike R
