Name 

Hi all

I am handling an OTRS ticket from a senior employee with Tigers company ETW Corp regarding the name of Tiger in this article It is contended unequivocally that Tont is not Tigers middle name and that his official middle name has always been Tiger 

I have analyzed the references presented here and two of the three used make no mention of Tont That leaves only the book quite frankly one reference in passing by a book does not outweigh both what Tiger has said himself on television and what is being contended in this OTRS ticket 2009061110035594 by someone who is authorised to represent him

I propose that both the Tont from the lead and the short sentence relating to how he got it both of which are sourced to the inpassing remark in that book be removed I ask for your comments in forming a consensus before doing so however

Regards
