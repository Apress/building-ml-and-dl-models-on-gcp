Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited the scene of the blast where he appeared to blame Boko Haram for the explosion saying We have lost quite a number We condole with our country men and women The issue of Boko Haram is quite an ugly history within this period of our own development Government is doing everything to make sure that we move our country forward But these are the unnecessary distractions that are pushing us backward But we will get over it he saidhttpwwwchannelstvcom20140414presidentjonathancancelstriptoibadanvisitssceneofblast

The attack comes a day after Nigerian senator Ahmed Zanna claimed the group had killed 135 civilians in north east Nigeria in the week preceding the blast httpwwwbbccouknewsworldafrica27006876
