In response to your message I have to point out some holes in your process If it were indeed true that I was insulting my friend even though you know that I am not because you actually read it yeah right Is this the response to your pitiful website to delete and gang up on new members who create new articles 

I and many others who read this article before it was wrongly censored believe that the admin staff for this website are simply trying to exercise totalitarian control over the site the only place where others actually have to take note of their opinions 

And responding to the last point of your message I will feel free to insult the incompetent whenever I choose Constructive criticism seems to have little effect on the isolated minds of the administrators
