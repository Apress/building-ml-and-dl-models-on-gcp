Fire Star looks like the trolls are at work all over now eh Hate to bother you again with my little war but as you can see the Discussion thread toward the end is totally cluttered by this Sam Brown jerk Even though I have made him and the others look like a fools Id just as soon not have all that trash online at all At the very least block Sam Brown so I dont have to keep playing last word with him LOL

Spoke with Howabout1 a few days ago and he was kind enough to reword some of the entry on me to make it less of a slam job Would ask one other favor in that regard Please remove the names given as aliases First of all they are not aliases they are friends of mine some of whom have already started getting harassing phone calls because the trolls know how to track down a name and have the area in which to look thanks to the details given I compare this to the current outing of Valerie Plame in the news media Revealing what the trolls believe to be my real names just encourages stalkers like the one I indicated above Not to mention other people with the same names who might be targeted inadvertently You might not think there is much danger from these miscreants but at the very least the flame war with them on the discussion page clearly shows how rabid and dedicated they are to my destruction 

Please consider this thanks
