Cool  Post your reference   

Oh Sorry I mistook the Mossberg 500 for a Remington 870 The Philippines uses the Mossberg 500 not the 870 I cant tell the difference between the 2 shotguns  Preceding unsigned comment added by 202376851   

Dear Winged Brick I understand that the Philippines doesnt use the Remington 870 but someone continues to add it to the Philippine Army Philippine Marines and Special Action Force pages I was wondering if you could do somthing about it  Preceding unsigned comment added by 202376814
