The spelling Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim available for rental only This version of the song however misspells Llanfair PG presumably to approximate the pronunciation and has the lyric todays the last Ill be spreading rather than spending It would seem therefore that this source cannot be considered canonical This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martins recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album however

The published version of the song as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs Charles Hansen Music  Books 1977 has the lyric printed as Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz and being a printed source as opposed to handwritten as is the vocal score can presumably be considered definitive Linda Lavins pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show for which the song was written follows this spelling which would suggest that the printed version is correct

As it is a fictional place name however any discussion of correct spellingpronunciation is an academic one at best
