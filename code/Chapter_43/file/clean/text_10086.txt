Mormonism and history merge proposal 
Storm I saw your note on Trodels page and wanted to touch base  I am definately against merging primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a one time issue  The most recent pattern of faithpromoting history was as a BYU trained historian I sincerely hope a one time event  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic closer to historiography having implications from Josephs time to the present  I dont know if this is the right title for such an article but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page  Please drop in and give your two cents  And besides there is certainly little room for more material in History of the Latter Day Saint movement  Best wishes as always
