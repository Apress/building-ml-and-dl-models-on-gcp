OK OK This has got a bit out of hand here
First off Im a member of the Vandalism Control Network Im a longterm recent changes patroller and new pages patroller Im a member of the countervandalism unit and so on I hope you count this as peer review
Right when you add CategoryMissouri to a page the page you added it to is automatically listed at the corresponding category list So when you add CategoryMissouri to a page it is also listed at CategoryMissouri
In this edit LindaWarheads removed the categories from your sandbox page so your sandbox wouldnt be listed on the category lists LindaWarheads gave an edit summary of Please remove cats or article shows up
If your editing an article in your sandbox and you want to add categories to it your best off using CategoryMissouri instead of CategoryMissouri This way the sandbox wont be added to the corresponding category list Then when youve finished the article and youre ready to create the article proper simply remove the  from the category tags and create your article 
ArmedCitizen with regard to your comments above
LindaWarheads did not make indiscriminate changes without justification As LindaWarheads provided an edit summary this is justification enough
In my opinion LindaWarheads did not act as a vandal and hide evidence of her actions
I hope this ends the matter If you dont feel it does please see WPDR
Also please remember to be civil and assume good faith
