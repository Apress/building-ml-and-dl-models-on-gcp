Question for Dominick You removed a link to two screen captures of EWTNs Ask an Expert QA The screen captures in question are of Fr Levis saying that the Novus Ordo Missae is a complete fabrication followed by an edited version of that answer I would like to see proof of this denial Seattle Catholic linked to the complete fabrication post with a link entitled EWTN Expert on the Novus Ordo Mass Traditiocom and Novus Ordo Watch two sedevacantist outfits also linked to it But most importantly I reported on it before any of them because I saw the QA posts  both of them the original complete fabrication post and the edited version  with my own eyes at EWTNs website One of those screen captures at the link you deleted is my own the other was taken by someone else If EWTN is denying this then some serious liars work for them So did EWTN lie on top of editing Fr Leviss post
