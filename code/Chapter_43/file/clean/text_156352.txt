or typology of three potential interpretive references

First frame of reference Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel

Given that many historians critics and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt they would say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying Theos Epiphanes God manifest etc

In Revelation John borrowed the Son of Perdition concept from the prophecies of Daniel relating them by language He refers to the star that fell from heaven by two names one Greek and the other Hebrew The Greek name is Appolyon from the Greek root word apolumi It refers to utter loss eternal destruction and disassociation The Hebrew name is Abaddon from the Hebrew root word abad which means the same thing as the Greek root word In the Book of Daniel the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the great beast is to be destroyed abad and given to the eternal flames ie hell

Second frame of reference Judas Iscariot

In John  Jesus says that of all his disciples none has been lost except the son of perdition The New International Version translates the phrase as the one doomed to destruction D A Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas character and to his destinyD A Carson The Gospel According to John Leicester Apollos 1991 563
