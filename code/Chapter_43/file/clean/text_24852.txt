Mohindra College 

Hi there I was reading the above article which you started and I was wondering whether you could clear up this sentence
Mohindra College Patiala got affliation with University of Punjab at Lahore in 1882 and later to Punjab University following the partition of India in 1947
I was wondering what you mean by Punjab University If you go to this page you can see that many different universities go by the name of Punjab University Could you change it to the one which you mean

Cheers    t  c
