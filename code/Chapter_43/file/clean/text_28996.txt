The original velocity posted 14 Nov 2001 didnt have either feet per second or meters per second just  Velocity 27875 kph 17321 mph numbers which remained until Dink87522s edit  So the 7643 should have been 7743 and it was here that way by the time this was split from Space Shuttle Program  That 27875 kmh  7743 ms  25404 fts but probably not to that precision
