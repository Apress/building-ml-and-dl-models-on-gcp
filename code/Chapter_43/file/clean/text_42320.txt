Many thanks for your message JG I am extremely flattered you think my career and critical approach merits an entry now knowing I have such an attentive reader I will redouble my efforts as a writer

You mentioned industry awards httpwwwbsmecomcategoryawardpastwinnerspage2 will verify I was gonged twice in 1996 and 2002 by the British Society of Magazine Editors for different mags Under my editorship in 1996 Mojo also won a major Professional Publishers Association award but I cannot provide an authoritative source  the PPA website does not list past winners

You may be interested to know that I am the nephew of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiDavid_Snow and a descendant via one of his brothers of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiJohn_Snow_physician

Thanks again and best wishes Mat
