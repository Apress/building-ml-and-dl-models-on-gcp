Cristina

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentines day or is that verboten

Anyway how are things Have you moved into the new apartment yet If not when Im really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself  and of course you and Kerim Dont forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place

You asked about Connie and Elvira They are both well thanks Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year  it is such a big event I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience Maybe next year  Life in Peru is good no news though Ill phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today Romantic meal with wine and candles followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky Or will he come home late from work drunk and with lipstick on his collar  

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you It is here but Im not too sure what to do Claire has invited me to Lake Constance something I need to think about Or I could spend three days studying German   Blöödy German If Europe wants one common currency then why not also one common language Not French  Sorry Kerim To be honest I dont like my German lessons The teaching format is for me very unconventional There is very little reading and writing  almost nothing Instead we are supposed to learn through talking and repeating While I know this will be perfect for some not everyone can learn in this way I sure you know the three ways people learn aural visual and kinestic Well I know Im a mixture of visual and kinestic And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper write it several times and actually use the words Also she the teacher is not supposed to talk in English Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language OK enough moaning about German

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I have to go to get my fix Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym Along with the musclefitness classes they also have more relaxing classes yoga pilates etc which I quite like I find listeningunderstanding the class instructor hard enough in English so to do it in German will be amusing The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home not too sure how to get there though Elvira wasnt pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed You know how jealous those latinas are 

OK time for me to leave you in peace Please give my greetings to all and you take care I shall be in touch again soon

Besitos
Dave
