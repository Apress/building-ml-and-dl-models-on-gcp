There thats what I am trying to say
Hindu nationalism has an already an article I dont see the point of reiterating it here again
The article was NOT created as an extension of HindiMuslim conflict That part is already mentioned here Islam_in_IndiaHinduMuslim_conflict If you think that is what needs to be done please move it to HinduMuslim_conflict
AntiBuddhist can be removed specially since his son himself corrected the mistakes But on the otherhand antichristian muslim sikhism hindu  they are fought over petty local policies and given the color of religion by recalling ancient atrocities It would be akin to Spanish acquisition causing antiSpanish violence now

While you and me know what Religious Violence in India typically refers to a year from now it will refer to what the articles name suggest with a new batch of trolls and POV pushers revert warring every edit The article was created to quench the Indiabashing thirst At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence because otherwise we wouldnt be discussing what the article really refers to etc
Also dont forget then the antiHindu violence specially in southern India and eastern India  places where Hindus are in minority And dont forget that the riots are never one sided Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India which is a ridiculous topic but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article Thats why I think going according to time will help
The problem with going X vs Y vs Z position is that it will never be NPOV it will never be factual and it will never be comprehensibletalk
