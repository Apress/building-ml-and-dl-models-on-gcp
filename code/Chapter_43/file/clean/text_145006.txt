earthworms 

becomes a pest in the new location threatening the local biodiversity

I work on earthworms  There are large stretches of the world where introduced species in the temperate zone mostly Lumbricidae are eliminating the local species  One of the notable native earthworms of Oregon Driloleirus macelfreshi is probably extinct due to competition  Lumbricids have fundamentally changed the soil characteristics in areas they invade  If this does not fit the definition of invasive then perhaps we are speaking different languages   0336 16 Feb 2004 UTC
