In response to the James Ridout Winchester question The Winchesters seem to have a family tradition of naming the first born son James Ridout and use SrJr as the designator  so He is actually James Ridot Winchester Sr given that his son has the same name but he is called Jamie by friends and family I also added the references to the Argonautes Albert Grossman and Butch McDade along with some other minor updates including the road tour of Canada In mid winter with the band stuffed into a Winnebago  a story in itself Id also like to make the observation that there are sections of this Bio that simply reek of amateur psychoanalysis and doubt that it is called for in this venue There is quite a bit of additional information I can supply having known Jesse since 1968 and will get it in in the future To the first writer You are correct in stating that he was not protesting the war it was a lot simpler and yet more complicated than that
