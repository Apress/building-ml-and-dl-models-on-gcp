For the record while i dont regularly see BotAS ive known a subscriber who surely would have spoken differently about it if it had discussions like whether it would melt through the earth to China I respect it as the sort of pub that might discuss how far toward the center of the earth a meltdown could progress Imputing to it discussions that took comicbook physics seriously is an intellectual crime on the positive side its also kinda like not noticing that you sat down in a pool of your murder victims bloodt
