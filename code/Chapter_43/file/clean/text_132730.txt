Id still like a compromise like the one used in the Vietnamese article Linguafranc Tiếng Nhật リンガフランカ Ringa Furanka Tiếng Anh Lingua franca That means as seen in the Vietnamese article Id like the original Japanese title due to the fact its the only officially given song title by both labels Additionaly Id like to acknowledge that some people know the song by linguafranc no matter whether it is a misspelling a fan title or not Plus Id like the correct English term Lingua Franca displayed because its de facto the correct English term and English translation for the Japanese title as well as what is officially used by composer etc That would be something like this リンガフランカ romanization Ringa Furanka English Lingua Franca largely known as linguafranc As far as I can see  and I are for this compromise while  and  seemingly are against any compromiseconsensus in favor of enforcing their personal believes Did I get each faction right
