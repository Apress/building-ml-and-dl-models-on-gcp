Glad to read you will be trying some editing methods different than what youve been doing up to now Ive been a Wikipedia contributor since early January 2005 Im not an administrator Theres plenty I dont knowincluding how it can possibly be that despite a giant chorus of editors and admins telling you you are violating WPOWN you continue to insist theres no ownership issue and that youre right and everyone else is wrong You seem to feel that the ANI case was opened to harrass you In fact it was opened to prevent much worse consequences such as your being banned from editing Chevrolet Vega or from editing at all down the line I triedÂ  as did many others  to help you understand the problem You flatly refuse to do so and for that reason I have great difficulty taking this present friendly chat of yours at face value Youve got an awful track record to rectify and as of just a few hours ago you were still building that bad track record Perhaps thats just facesaving bluster and your behaviour really is going to change quickly and substantially I hope so because you obviously have a great deal to bring to the project But your long record of crummy behaviour makes that hope extremely thin Please prove me wrong  TC
