If the online sources are fine then I dont understand why you have a problem with the article I dont understand what episode citations which need more info means I put the name of the episode and the episode number I dont see anything in the guidelines that says that the way I wrote the article is wrong I wrote about what we know about the character and I wrote about how the creator came up with the character how the actor who plays the character approaches it and a little about how critics have responded to the character You tell me its up to me to work on the article If you can explain how Im supposed to do that when three different people constantly take the article out Id like to hear it
