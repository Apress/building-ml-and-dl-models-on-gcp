My stance of being a Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article Or cant a video game journalist for example not have hisher personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time As for the colour code I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions Like I said in a previous post Alright this is getting out of control Youre getting this YesNo template thing all wrong seriously Someone at my talk page said the following To use an extreme example Does the console kill people the answer is No which is a positive So by your philosophy would you color it with green because its a good thing Wrong No consoles do not kill people and yes it is POSITIVE but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no and that must already  mean something by itself The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity not subjectivity But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him Which means that if he thinks that something positivecolored green is a negative thing for him thats his problem He can think whatever he wants of this information I hope this clears things up To sum it up YesAffirmativeGreen  NoNegativeRed personal preferences dont come into account Again as for the Vita issue this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page  If youre not satisfied with the consensus feel free to discuss away But next time please do a little bit more research before you start pointing fingers here Remember were here to help
