Digging myself a deeper hole  Is that a threat  There were no vandalism warnings there was a note about a page that I made when I initially started editing here that was then removed as I had not read the information about what can and cannot be posted here  What we had was a case of some random user taking an overactive interest in my talk page a talk page which he had no reason to have an opinion on I should think that the editors here have something better to do than vandalise talk pages I guess that guy proved me wrong
