had been busy when you protected it so it looked like one Anyway the history shows a lot more editwarring lately than vandalism There are a lot of eyeballs on the article including several admins and umpteen veteran editors The editwarring proves that they can all revert edits quite successfully The vandalism is the usual random silliness rather than being attacks or similar This all seems quite under control Left a note at RFPP as well Cheers   Talk
