Yes but the options  of such a management system would be limited by the discharge voltage of the weakest cell of the series connected system which of course then becomes an important quality control problem in the manufacturing process This can occur in other battery systems like the lead acid submarine battery systems which incidently are sometimes built into 2 cell containers But it does sound more complicated for the multiple cell systems
