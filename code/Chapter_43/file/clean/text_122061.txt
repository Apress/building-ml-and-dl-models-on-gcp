You say you will keep asking for unblock until this scandal is resolved which indicates to me that you dont realize that your access to this talk page can be taken away  Theres no firm rule on that but its pretty normal for admins to be willing to do three reviews of a block but often will lock the talk page at the fourth unblock request The rules dont allow checkuser to be performed at the request of a blocked user and the rules do encourage editors not to bother checkusers with obvious cases like when the ip and the named user are making the exact same edits   talk  contribs
