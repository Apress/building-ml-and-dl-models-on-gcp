Peer Review

As others have mentioned above the tone doesnt seem to be encyclopedialike its more of an educational piece on what happened from your view  In the opening section you write This operation was the result of wary parents under the newly instated Castro Regime who did not want to give up their parental rights to the Cuban government Largely unpublicized for fear of being viewed as political propaganda this underground operation eventually became the largest recorded exodus of unaccompanied youth in the Western hemisphere That is a very hard claim to substantiate without any sort of reference The whole Demographics of Minors section could either be put in another section or completely deleted because earlier you already state the children were Cuban and their parents didnt agree with Castro so it is in my belief their religions and social status dont matter enough for its own section eo
