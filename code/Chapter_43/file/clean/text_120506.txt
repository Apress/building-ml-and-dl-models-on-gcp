This page has improved greatly in terms of content I feel having read it that I understand the essential skills of a shooting guard as well as bonus skills the way a shooting guard fits into a typical play etc Now the page needs some work on grammar and style This sentence for instance is odd

Shooting guards can be known for excelling at certain skills that shooting guards should be able to exhibit

Well of course At the very least a player should master the skill set for his or her position no If this sentence is meant as I believe it is judging from the awkward sentence fragment that immediately follows in the paragraph to introduce a discussion of players who are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set as opposed say to being allaround good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position then I suggest changing the sentence to say just that Certain shooting guards are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set as opposed say to being allaround good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position Then I would begin the next sentence with the words Such shooting guards include    The phrase such as which starts the sentence at present is appropriate to a subordinate clause not a full sentence 

Allen Iverson
Should ai be on the list of notable shooting guards  He listed as a pg but he more of a shooting guard 
Of course he should Hes a combo guard

being able to dunk in an athletic high flying manner such as Michael Jordan or being able to throw it down with reasonable strength such as Jason Richardson
same thing

Sasha Vujacic
Should this guy be listed among the rest I think not Please remove him from the list

The list of 2 guards who are known for attacking the rim is laughably inaccurate  Allan Houston was a pure jump shooter Ben Gordon never goes all the way to the rim on his drives He pulls up for floaters and jump shots well before the rim  McGrady and Carter attacked earlier in their careers but are now constantly criticized by league analysts for being too passive They are mostly jump shooters now  Jason Richardson is a great dunker but I would certainly not put him on this list either He drives to the rim far less than he shoots  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

Famous Shooting guards 

Even though there is a separate list of all shooting guards linked to on this page there also should be a simple list of famous shooting guards actually written here on the page similar to how the Small forward page does it
