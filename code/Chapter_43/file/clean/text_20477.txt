Cor there is something odd there  will see tks Re the diagram actually I probably have a version with those extra arrows as well but in theory since one could go every which way forward through the steps I dropped them in favour of the nominal classbyslass route  The coloured stream backgrounds at least show that A is the next step purely in MilHist terms after B and FA comes after GA in WPwide grades Plus I have the disclaimer in text just before the diagram that this is not the only route through the classes Whew rationalisation complete Cheers
