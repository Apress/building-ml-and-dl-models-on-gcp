In response to your threat on my user page 

What is a green thumb for getting pages deleted Im sorry you are taking this personally but your page was nowhere near appropriate for Wikipedia and as you saw from the AFD page there was strong consensus on that from other editors In addition I did not delete your page an administrator did As for the sockpuppets I did not make the initial report but I definitely added to it Once again it was a Wikipedia administrator that blocked the accounts after their investigation not me I am not an administrator and do not have the ability to delete pages block users etc You need to take your case to the admins involved instead of making silly threats against me
