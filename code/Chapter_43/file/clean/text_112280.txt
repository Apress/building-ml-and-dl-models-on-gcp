Eating of Frogs

I have never heard that frogs are forbidden because they live on land and water However there is a hadith in which the prophet said it is forbidden to kill frogs Since we are only allowed to eat slaughtered animals and to slaughter a frog would be forbidden therefore it follows we cant eat frogs
