Im not sure what point you are making but the current camber thrust article doesnt even mention the rolling cone model mostly for lack of reliable sources As explained on that article talk page neither Cossalter nor Pacejka mention the cone analogy and Foale concedes at the top of page 224 that the actual corner radius described is considerably greater than the cone radius Thus it is not mentioned here or in the bicycle and motorcycle dynamics article
