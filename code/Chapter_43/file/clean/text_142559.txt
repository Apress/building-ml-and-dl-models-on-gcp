You may find other people changing the introduction in astonished disbelief of the pine waves story A little repetition never hurt especially since it gives a chance to add your information about the different Kanji pictograms

It should be agreeable to everybody that possibly useful information correction of popular misconceptions should not be removed from a public encyclopedia Doing that might be considered vandalism and I may have to complain to more senior Wikipedians

At least try to keep your edits clean if you must continue reversing my additions This last time you left off the period in the introduction and left the Notes header unused in addition to your first reversal  that makes your changes look more like vandalism Youll note that I look back at my edits and correct typos
