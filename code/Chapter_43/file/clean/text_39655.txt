In fact if you look at his contributions they are pretty weird Some of them have literally no substance at all Look at these  All he does is capitalize the A where people cannot even see it and where it does not affect anything I mean if that does not look like intentional inflating of his contributions to you I am not sure what will Here is one where he just changes the phrasing even though the original phrasing was not problematic  Maybe that is understandable though He could just fancy that phrasing more He skipped over an actual error though Winger should not be capitalized Even if these were necessary they would be extremely minor contributions anyway He also goes down an endless list of names though that alone is not weird until you take into account the type of edits he is making They could literally just be combinations picked from a list and they seem to be They are grouped by ethnicity Many of these pages could be done more in depth as well It seems like he is simply looking for minor edits Maybe that is not so wrong but the act of finding a page would be relatively high cost to most people They would rather spend time at each page editing I suppose he devised a way to make it lower cost though so that could just be a particular characteristic about him Still what is the point of doing endless minor edits Maybe it is a misjudgment but a bunch of relatively inconsequential edits done in great error should not count for much in a consideration of substance of contribution
