This was the text as it stood

A mighty fortress is our God    
 A strong defense and weapon    
 He helps us out of all distress    
 That has us now afflicted    
 The old evil foe    
 With power now attacks    
 Great strength and much guile    
 His dreadful weapons are    
 On Earth he has no equal    
    
 With our powers we will fail    
 We would be soon defeated    
 But for us fights the chosen man    
 Whom God Himself elected    
 You ask who that is    
 Hes called Jesus Christ    
 The armies leading Lord    
 There is no other God    
 He holds the field forever    
    
 And if the world should fill with woe   
 And would us all devour   
 We would not shake in mortal fear   
 Our hopes they can prevail   
 The prince of the world   
 As grim as he may be   
 Still does us no ill   
 He comes he is judged   
 One word and hell collapse   
    
 The Word it shall forever stand   
 And no thanks need be said   
 He stands by us for all our lives   
 With his great loving gifts   
 Let them take your body   
 Goods honor child wife   
 Send all to the wind   
 They have no worth in this world   
 The Kingdom is ours forever
