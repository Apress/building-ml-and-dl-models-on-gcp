Baroque Guitars are NOT tenstring guitars

Andrew frankly you are mistaken It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a tenstring guitar No one refers to the baroque lute as the 24string lute but correctly as the 13course lute This is a wellestablished musicologicalorganological convention 12string guitar is the only exception to this and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular culture in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses If two strings function as one string they are a COURSE not two separate strings In contrast a tenstringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted This is not the case on the baroque guitar which effectively only has five courses Moreover the term tenstring guitar has come to signify a particular instrument which is NOT a baroque guitar You are evidently not a musicologistorganologistsemiologistsemantician so I dont see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue which relates to organology and semantics
