Offensiveness is immaterial Your sig is in violation of WPSOAP Similar signatures have been required to change in the past Please change it Thank you  Â   copied across from my talk
I concur with Roux WPSOAP says

Having such a line in your signature only serves two purposes
The obvious case ie the literal in which case your statement violates WPSOAP
To offend atheists or people of other religions in which case your signature is divisive and is not permitted whilst it may serve this purpose I understand it probably wasnt intended
About 2 billion people are Christians  that means over two thirds of people living in the world do not believe the same thing as you and will potentially be offended like I was and am It is not an appropriate thing to have in a signature  talk
