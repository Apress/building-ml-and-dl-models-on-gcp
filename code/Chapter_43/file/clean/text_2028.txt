Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation  In this case organic remains was added to explain the word they  While WM used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition recently buried remains such as what is now occurring are not fossils  From the Dictionary of Geologic Terms 3rd edition 1984 by Bates and Johnson  FOSSIL  Any remains trace or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earths crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil for it is in historic time  And further you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era

WM likely used the term fossil loosely like many editors of this WP page to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future  It is unfortunate that WM were not as precise as they might have been because uninformed people such as TalkOrigins misunderstand and twist what they said

As much impact as WM have had on Creationary thought nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood is now way out of date  Modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond The Genesis Flood  When critics quote it it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism
