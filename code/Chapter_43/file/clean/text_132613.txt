Congratulations

Dear  

Congratulations on your new family D

I had no idea that you were a cat person  I hope mother and kitties are doing well and will bring you lots of joy as they grow up  My own kitties are fullgrown but still mischievous not surprisingly but Im getting some of the same feeling every day as flowers bloom and berries swell in my garden  Some of my strawberries are almost ready to eat  yum   Good luck with evodevo comments to follow when I get a chance
