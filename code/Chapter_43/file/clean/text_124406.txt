Hi Ipigott
 Thank you for your mail After reading it I have looked into the subject a bit and can see that the Wikicode for adding categories is straight forward  my first step to adding relevant categories Now I need to find good ways to generate them Here I have got as far as to the idea of copying categorylines from similarsubject articles But I am still in doubt about the best other ways such as by means of some existing lists search functions for this in Wikipedia that might exist  or other methods So if you have got tips they would be much appreciated Kind regards  Old Dane
