Tallin bus route list 

Please review your decision as I think Ive just proven in my reply that your conclusions are totally unsupportable Based on all available evidence it seems to me to be obvious that a list of bus routes of a major European capital city would indeed survive an attempt to delete it even in 2014 Indeed I think a good case could be made that this should be an automatic assumption at least for capital cities or cities over a certain size  I dont see the point of forcing people to jump through the same hoops every single time when you can just as easily apply a few logical tests to accurately predict what the outcome would be of a proper review of all available literature in each case where it involves a typical modern city one which by necessity has an established and regulated bus route network which Davey is of course not doing in any of these cases
