Since the 17th Amendment Senators have represented the inhabitants of states not state governments  Since Senators currently represent people it seems that one justification for an equal suffrage Senate has been lost  Hamilton called states artificial entities  

Since Senators are now elected just like Congressmen it seems doubtful than anyone can claim that Senators are inherently wiser than Congressmen either  If Senators do consider wider interests than Congressmen it would seem the reasons for that are that Senators represent larger and more diverse districts than Congressmen and have six year termsUserDinopup
