This isnt usually an area I work in and I generally have more than enough tasks in the areas I am familiar Ive decided to read it and give it a try After reading both your draft and the main article yours is a major improvement and is much more encyclopedic and polished well I agree with your concerns on the talk page about the advantagesdisadvantages section far too much is unsourced or irrelevant but I believe the Scientific studies section should be included in some form  That is relevant information in my opinion and seems to be at least decently sourced may need a bit of work It is not 100 relevant but the sentence Align paid OrthoClear 20 million and it agreed to end its operations which company does it refer to I also assume that you will include the nonfree media FileInvisalign software user interfacepng after the changes are done
Im glad that you were able to engage multiple editors while working on your draft Im very impressed every time I see your work not only due to quality but how to go about achieving that level of quality Let me reread it again tomorrow and Ill handle the requested edit for you  Cheers
