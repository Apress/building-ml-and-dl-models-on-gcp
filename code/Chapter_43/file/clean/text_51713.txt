Thats fine for a Norman but not for a Pict descendant YDNA does NOT change other than str mutations in the number of repeats As further evidence there is now an established DNA link between Davidson Shaw Smith and Mac Kay members The Comyns were ENEMIES of Clan Chattan Robert de Bruce KILLED a Comyn and Clan Chattan FULLY supported Robert de Bruce Please use your heads and stop with the NormanComyn crap for my Clan its slanderous and just stupid to persist in posting blatantly false information regardless of it having a source There is NOTHING proving any validity of that source but much more information that does prove our CelticPictish origin Stop being pigheaded and go mess with some other clans if that is how you get your enjoyment
