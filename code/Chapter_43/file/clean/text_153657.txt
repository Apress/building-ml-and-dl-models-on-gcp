Thank you re Reification 

  Thank you for pointing out that the way in which I was editing was incorrect I thought that in order to make original research claims these needed to be published in journals and then linkedto I didnt realize that what I had done at the Reification fallacy page was advocating for the application of that properlyreviewed research to a topic to which the research was related but not directly about which then in itself counted as an original extension and thus also original research It took me a while to understand why this was bad form but I got it eventually I will be more careful in the future Should you see this happen again the policy reference is to WPORIGINALSYN

Cheers
