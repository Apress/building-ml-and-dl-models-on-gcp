POD Maybe you are right Okay you win I quit I should be satisfied that the worlds leading authority on the Maya David Stuart included in his recent book mention of the galactic alignment This is the ASTROLOGICAL phrase I coined when first discussing the apparent alignment of the solstices with the galactic equator midway between the Harmonic Convergence in 1987 and 2012 Having so many people even consider for a moment that these two events belong in a galactic context is a job well done Maybe just maybe if John Major Jenkins ever actually comes to understand this advanced astrological perspective he can explain it to everyone else on TV Then maybe just maybe Wikipedia will get it right Hahhahhahahahhahhahahahahhahahahahahaha  Mardyks
