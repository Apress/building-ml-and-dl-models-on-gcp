since this source is cited in the article would like to point out the mission statement of this website 

Our contributors realized that the mainstream media around the world as well as publications from respected policy analysts tended to mischaracterize Pakistan by exaggerating its deficiencies while downplaying its endeavors and achievements in pursuit of a peaceful world
We welcome any papers articles data book reviews historical papers and articles pictures from the glorious past and the loving present and thought provoking thesis on Pakistan to be published on the  website
PMC and its Editors reserve the right to accept or reject any material without any explanation

Does not appear to be meeting the criteria elucidated at WPRS  looks like they accept only articles which talk about the glorious past and the loving present of Pakistan and discount what is said in the mainstream media and in publications from respected policy analysts reject other material without any explanation  hardly the qualities WP requires of RS  I propose that info cited to this source be removed
