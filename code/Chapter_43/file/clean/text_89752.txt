Should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like RPGRPG Listings
Well there are also listings in the subgenre articles so I think we should merge them  0728 Jan 16 2003 UTC

I think the more useful distinction is between Roleplaying games and Roleplaying generally Im taking the latter from this page and making a new page just for the more general case

Also note that I use roleplaying as the generic term more commonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in Websters New World College Dictionary Moreover I am adopting the roleplaying game usage hyphen between role and playing in order to follow that convention and because it makes sense grammatically hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun 

However I am thinking that roleplay game follows common usage better than roleplaying game But Im not going to redirect the page now anyway Dec 26 2001  

No one I know of and I know lots of gamers says roleplay game  Its always roleplaying game and I am sure thats the most common usage   

Not to sound like a nerd or anything but White Wolf is not strictly speaking a roleplaying game They are a publisher Their roleplaying game universe World of Darkness encompasses between 5 and 12 or so depending on how you count them roleplaying games OK Im really not that much of a nerd OK Maybe just a bit  1039 Dec 6 2002 UTC

I added the Notable RPG Developers and Publishers heading for links to companies and maybe individual creators  1615 Dec 6 2002 UTC

Isnt Battletech more a tabletop war game and not an RPG I have never played it but isnt there Mechwarrior which is an RPG based on Battletechs world  0724 Jan 16 2003 UTC

Battletech was purely wargame then Mechwarrior was made to turn it into an RPG however they are basically the same thing Mechwarrior is like ADDs Player Handbook and BattleTech rules are simply the rules for combat battletech being more complex than ADD Battletech is notable from other RPGs in that correctly played ones character is as mortal as all the enemies one fights so usually you die Its basically a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign and most people generally have the commander of their forces represent themselves thus an RPG and a wargame Also its common for the GM or DM to be replaced by a classical referee and then the players instead of playing as a team go to war with each other 

Battletech was a miniatures game based on Japanese anime in the mech  genre Later a set of rules was developed that allowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign Battletech was published FASA which is now out of business Along with Battletech FASA also published games such as Behind Enemy Lines World War Two skirmish game Shadowrun cyberpunkmagic returns roleplaying and Earthdawn fantasy roleplaying At present both Battletech and Earthdawn have found new publishers

For a list of RPGs I recommend trying the Yahoo and Google directories You will find listings for literally hundreds of games Have fun

Finally when I have it composed I will be uploading an essay on roleplaying games and why they really arent games at all At least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants

Hope this finds you all well 1514 Feb 9 2003 UTC

Sounds interesting but remember that Wikipedia tries to maintain a neutral point of view  It may be better to simply provide a link to your essay   1543 Feb 9 2003 UTC

MerriamWebsters definition of game includes as its first entry activity engaged in for diversion or amusement and then equates it with play  Dictionarycom defines again as the first entry a game as being an activity providing entertainment or amusement  Just by these two references alone and youll find similar in any good dictionary attempts to declare roleplaying games as somet
