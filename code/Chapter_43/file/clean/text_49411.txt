I cling to facts and truth Many of your socalled reliable sources couldnt even tell you what Minor Threat and Black Flag sounded like let alone these bands People that know what theyre talking about usually see it as a waste of time to deal with idiots that dont or that wont listen to the truth because it ruins their cool mainstream image of what theyve been spoonfed to believe about emo Greenwald isnt any better of a source Hes just someone that wrote a bad book Big deal Dont you even understand why itd be hard to get old articles on here No internet existed Bands broke up fast Records are out of print The record labels closed No talking heads in the media knew what the hell emo was in the early 90s Common sense And this article doesnt even really talk about what makes emo emo and I know someone like you couldnt do that either Instead of talking about what kind of music or vocals are used time is wasted on lyrical content Those are words Lyrics do not define music genres Anyone can write a song about any topic they want The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how its played Wheres the fact that bands very rarely used clean melodic singing vocals early on It was either a yellingscreaming type vocal from hardcore or they would actually just talk in the songs like how bands like Indian Summer and Moonraker did Genre is how you play not what you say That concept is lost here along with many others
