Kurt Green Gaudino were demoted to FC Bayern II as per the footnote that I placed  I think you are getting confused in that they have a professional contract but they do not train with nor do they play with FC Bayern  It would be like putting all the Hartford Wolfpack on the New York Rangers roster  They all have pro contracts but have been demoted  Kurt Green do not play for FC Bayern Munich  Same applies to Lucic  He has a procontract as does Fabian Benko but he does not play for FC Bayern  He plays for FC Bayern II  Dylan Strome plays for the Erie Otters  Hes under contract with the Phoenix Coyotes  But Wiki correctly identifies the Phoenix Coyotes roster with only those that play there

Lastly it was footnoted which really irritates me that you would lie and even suggest a vandalism charge  I think youve greatly overreached your boundaries and should you continue to harass my edits I will take action  Youve been warned
