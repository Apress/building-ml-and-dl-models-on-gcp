Shakya Demographics 
Hello Ogress I see that you have removed my addition of demographics in Shakya article saying that the article is about 2500year old kingdom So where do I add the details regarding the present day demographics of the Shakya people  Should I create a separate article for that which I do not believe is required  Did you read the citations provided  Please Guide  Illuminaati  Â Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
