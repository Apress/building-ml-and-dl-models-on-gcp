First you excuse your attack and are critical of my comments Bullshit vs 12 year old is unequal in that your remark suggests the entire thought process of another person is to be regarded as equal to that which a male cow excretes where as the other remark suggests the thoughts as having come from someone much younger Is that Harsh or something more

Second I cited the indiviual and suggested that you reread the article for proof but since you are too lazy here is the opening sentense According to the founding member James H Fetzer article overview here 

Third that the KKK thinks blacks inferior is a fact of the group and is stated in the opening sentence of their Wiki Ku Klux Klan KKK is the name of a number of past and present fraternal organizations in the United States that have advocated white supremacy White Supremacy implies blacks and any nonwhite has lesser intellect and are less human and I have not sought to change or soften that definition 

You seem to forget that this is what they are and what they beleive It does not matter if I take offense or disagree because it is the truth Likewise the group Scholars for 911 Truth was founded by James H Fetzer and I cited his definition of the organization in the overview You have no legitimate basis for removing that regardless of your opinion Are you rushing over to the Klan article right now to make it less offensive to blacks OH why not Because you know full well that it represents the truth and your thoughts on the matter are not relevant Ok now you get it If you revert this article again I will first go to the KKK site and look for similar cleansing and if you have not done it I will come back here and revert this back to the truth BTW I know you are not a Marine I was being sarcastic If you were a Marine your sorry but would be off in Iraq defending James H Fetzers right to say what he wants and bringing your flavor of democracy to a group of people who clearly are need of it
