Or may be someone is trying to distort it I do not thin it is a nightmare to sort out On one hand it is bing said that Ibbetson as per Wiki policies is not a reliable source then his reference is used here Other references are ignored And now this line which to me seems to suggest is that some people in that area were considered as or recognized as Sainis due to their marriage with Malis where as sources have showed the other way around that Malis were called Malis and then adopt Saini name as per Census report and Jodhpur king letting them do so More this line that have mentioned above should not be used as it does not have any citation and is against the Wiki policies
