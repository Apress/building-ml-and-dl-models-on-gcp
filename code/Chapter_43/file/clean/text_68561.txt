I dont think that unborn child is a misleading term Theres no need for the terms emotive and scientific Just the word term should suffice Let the readers decide which side is correct Using those words violates NPOV It clearly shows favoritism for the antilife side Im clearly correct Theres no reason for an editing war on this Just agree with me
