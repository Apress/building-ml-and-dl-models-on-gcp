Ive reverted your addition to this article because it violates several Wikipedia policies  Please read our policy on neutral point of view and the one on original research  The executive summary is this please do not add your own personal opinions to article  Any opinion interpretation or analysis must be accompanied by a citation from a legitimate reliable source that is qualified to express the opinion  If people consider this film the other Casablanca then surely someone with credentials must have written about it somewhere  Find that source and you can use it to support adding the opinion to the article  Without such a source though the opinion cannot appear in the article  Thanks
