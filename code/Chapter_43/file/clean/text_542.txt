Hi Fracophonie

Thanks for taking the time to write such a long message  I appreciate this

In terms of what I said about the age  I didnt mean to cause offense I thought I read somewhere that you had to be over 18 to make these decisions but I think I was getting confused with the check user privileges 

I have already read some of those policies but will read the rest later today I am not a troll  I just need time to get used to all these acronyms policies etc

From what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what I was expecting

I really dont have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what I have said For example one user just wrote there is another site called Amiritenet This is Amiritecom This is precisely why I had to keep responding on the AFC delete page 

In terms of the rest I agree to do them of course I can only apologise once I am unblocked  can you apologise for me

On a side note I am actually French and Jewish shame about the gay part though
