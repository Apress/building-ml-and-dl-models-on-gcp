Question 

Hello Latics I noticed that you revert vandalism occasionally Would you like me to grant your account rollback rights to make vandalfighting easier for you Just remember that rollback like Twinkle should only be used to revert vandalism and that misuse of the tool can lead to its removal Tell me what you think Thanks
