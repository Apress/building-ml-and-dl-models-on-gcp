 Article Cleanup 

I decided to do a major overhaul on the article I tried organizing and removing information that isnt neccisary The article still contains the major section but they are just cleaned up now It didnt take as long as I thought too  

 Cohost auditions 

I think that the audition seciton is not as relevant anymore considering its been a year and their is a 99 chance that none of the contestants will be announced as winner Does anyone else agree with me that we should remove the section  

nofeedback
Im getting no feedback so im assuming its ok  

Incomplete Segment List

I noticed last time that there was a complete list of segments that were there before AOTS started its new set Now after they got back from E3 and the new set took effect some of the segments are gone both former and current In order for a wii to be effective and accurate ALL of the segments including those that are deleted should be listed So somebody needs to add the deleted segments there please  

I cleaned up the section around that time and deleted segments that didnt need to be listed on the article There were also a lot of segments listed that only happened once or twice Also there were a lot of skits listed as well which are not segments I think after a certain period of time old segments probably wont be relevant to the article  

Do they even do Live Music Thursday any more

To be honest I do not know why this was tagged as needing cleanup I think the information is laid out pretty much as well as could be I do feel that the History section needs work but everything else looks fine and the tables listing the shows features are quite excellent so I dont think a cleanup tag on the aritcle as a whole is necessary However I am not going to simply remove it as others may disagree with me   

I got the botmessage on my Talk Page when I logged in today and it said that this  article needed cleanup I checked it thinking someone had shifted the tables all around or made all of the paragraphs singlesentence rambles But it was essentially the same as it always was tables in good shape information about the cast etc This might never be a complete article seeing as it airs 5 nights a week but I dont think a Cleanup tag is necessary in this case Maybe something more specific is required but I would support deleting the tag  

Still has the cleanup message and I dont know why Its not like the page is getting vandalized it was put on SemiProtection on January 26th Any thoughts on this The article can never really be complete since the show is an ongoing process  

 テレビ番組の攻撃 

Probably not note worthy but this Japanese writing flashes on the screen for a second during the new intro actually quite old now It translates
