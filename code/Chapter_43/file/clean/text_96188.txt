I found your last post rather inaccurate 

Here is what I exactly said

I am not interested in viewing your best Wikipedia articles where unscholarly irrational exhuberance runs amok with nonattribution gay abandon If I want to read such material I can go to the super market and read the National Enquirer

In short your best Wikipedia articles  are not necessarily the true best Wikipedia articles  

And again sticking to Wikipedia rules will produce an exemplary Wikipedia BSF article  So far nobody has stated why this is not so and I believe they never will   I think Wikipedia knows how good Wikipedia articles are written
