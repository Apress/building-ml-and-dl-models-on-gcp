Inconsistent application of your policies reverting edits 

I I noticed you undid an edit I made on Historical Jesus Why would you undo that edit saying the section on controversial opinions is for scholars Because Leo Tolstoy is not a scholar and Leo Tolstoy is in that section too If you do not provide a logical explanation I will assume that the edit was not done in good faith I think you have two options here one is to remove also the Tolstoy reference from the section 2 is to undo your removal of my submission Looking forward to hearing from you Respectfully
