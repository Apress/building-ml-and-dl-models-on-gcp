Is there a higher authority than you that I can appeal to

Is there some way we can talk over the phone so that I can explain to you or anyone else you care to nominate what I am concerned about and why  I am frustrated by my inability to get to the ground truth in this vexatiously crippling rulebound system as it only seems to be able to get to what most editors happen to believe without providing any reliable functional process for getting past misconceptions into the ground truth  Science itself provides such a functional process known as the scientific method but Wikipedia doesnt operate on that paradigm  Instead it operates on an anachronistic rulebased paradigm that wobbles to what the most dominant Wikipedia editors believe  When it comes to characterizing living persons that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix

There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions  But science is an arduous process and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning

Getting people to honestly question their assumptions and conscientiously examine both their assumptions and the evidence for them is one of the recurring challenges in science education

As a science educator it pains me beyond words to observe how badly we have failed to inculcate a scientific mindset into the educable public
