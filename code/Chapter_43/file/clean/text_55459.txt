Sorry but I cant agree that Rouxs personal attacks are open to interpretation No matter how he and others justify those words the bashing is not excusable Id rather blame myself for my poor writing that conveys what Im trying to say As for pathetic I sometimes pick up idioms or usages from editors here the usage of pathetic is what I learn from admins here They use it when calling editors in dispute so I cant believe it What I want you from right now is just let me alone ThanksCaspian blue
