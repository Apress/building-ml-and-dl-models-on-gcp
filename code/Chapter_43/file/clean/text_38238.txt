Folly Wildlife Rescue Trust deletion 

Did you even look at the page before you took action I am protesting your work in disappearing the articlerefrencehttpenwikipediaorgwikiFolly_Wildlife_Rescue_Trust  Please do not hold my personal indignation about the article deletion against the editor who created the page I have nothing to do with the editor other than trying to help add more notability to the article Which is what i was doing when I saw it is now GONE The article was even changed from stub to article and all objections and suggestions that were made to the creator were done As a researcher myself I learned quite a bit of information that was previously unknown to myself by reading the article and learning about the Folly Wildlife Rescue Trust  Im personally astounded that admin on Wikipedia would work so hard at putting obstacles to this information being published in the way 240133234
