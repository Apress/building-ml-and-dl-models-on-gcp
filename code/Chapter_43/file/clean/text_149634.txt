How not to vandalize 
Recently Timothy Usher has made repeated attempts to unilaterally remove content without consensus  Ive reverted these and will continue to do so within the limits of 3RR  If Tim wants to make major changes such as these mass deletions hes going to need to get a consensus here first  If he does I will honor it
