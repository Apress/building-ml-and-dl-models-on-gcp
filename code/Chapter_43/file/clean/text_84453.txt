You havent been looking in the right places See Melnik Nesebar Burgas Sozopol and so on Of course some of them have it in a separate section but thats hardly necessary for most small settlements
As for your thinking that certain users are obsesesive thats irrelevant These place have Bulgarian alternate names because lots of Bulgarians used to live once That is sufficient according to Wikipedia policy And since you have also been deleting historical sections you argument is quite hypocritical
