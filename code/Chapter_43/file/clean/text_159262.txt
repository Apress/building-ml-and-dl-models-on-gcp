In favor of merging
Since August 2010 the underground and aboveground Cheongnyangni stations have been directly transferrable through a transfer passageway contradicting Peterhansen2032s argument As a rule of thumb on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway the information is combined into one even for stations with different names eg Isu Station Cheonan Station Rather than having to go through a disambiguation page to access information on one of the stations it would be much more efficient to integrate it into one page for convenient viewing I support merging
