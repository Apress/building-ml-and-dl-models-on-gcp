Newbie here  with finger on Oph pulse for going on 25 years familiar with issues history etc makes this suggestion for clarity the symbol assigned to Ophiuchus on the Zodiac page should be removed  Here are the reasons 1 Symbol use gives the impression that Oph is a zodiac sign  2 As far as I am aware no symbol has officially been decided upon by those who are working with the Oph energy in the context of Astrology  I am curious just for my own information who came up with this symbol and what it represents to himherthem  Thank you
