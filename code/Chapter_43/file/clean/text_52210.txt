Adding the date to the google search is POV and OR Why would you believe an unsourced date in an article The reason they are unsourced is because the editor probably couldnt find a source As I have said before it is atrocious how wp treats blp articles Far too many want them to be unsourced undue tabloids Mentioning Mr Maks grammar is highly uncalled for What part of Dutch dont you understand If you cant come up with better arguments and keep repeating the same lame ones then I will remove them and ask you not to post on my talk page again
