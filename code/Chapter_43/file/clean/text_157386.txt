Rollback 

Hello 99of9 I have granted rollback rights to your account the reason for this is that after a review of some of your contributions I believe I can trust you to use rollback correctly by using it for its intended usage of reverting vandalism and that you will not abuse it by reverting goodfaith edits or to revertwar For information on rollback see WikipediaNew admin schoolRollback and WikipediaRollback feature If you do not want rollback just let me know and Ill remove it Good luck
