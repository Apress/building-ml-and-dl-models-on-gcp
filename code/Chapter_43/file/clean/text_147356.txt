Id appreciate some help from someone I have been blocked 

I posted a long and very good response to the David Shankebone problem on the page Edit conflict WikipediaAdministrators noticeboardIncid  And someone came and erased it and blocked me  Id appreciate it if someone could go and repost my response  There was nothing offensive about it  I have a right to defend my point of view
