Could another admin have a serious word in the ear of StuRat talk  contribs He is a consistently disruptive editor who regularly accuses admins of abuse and cabalism This evening alone he has been

Accusing an admin of an abuse of Admin authority in protecting a page being targeted by a persistent banned user whom incidently StuRat was an erstwhile colleague of and still occasionally adds content on his behalf 

Goading an editor who indicated they are leaving the project after a run in with a new editor with a suspiciously detailed knowledge of the project 

Replacing the goading comment after three independent editors expressed disaproval the aforementioned new user gets in on the act too 

I have already warned him but he ignored me and I am a bit too close to take any action without stoking the claims of abuse Thanks Rockpocket 

1 Note that RP did not request a block is it normal to take a request to talk with an editor and ignore that and issue a block instead   

2 I do believe that it is inappropriate for an Admin involved in an edit war on a page to protect that page when it has the version they support and believe the talk page for that page in this case Wikipedia_talkReference_deskguidelines was the appropriate place to bring up that concern  

3 As I stated on RPs talk page I was not goading an editor who said they were leaving Wikipedia but merely stated that I believed they would be back and why I thought so  I did object to the removal of that statement from UserClio the Muses talk page by anyone other than Clio  However once Clio removed the statement herself I respected that and had already told RP that I would respect that  Somebody else then put it back in possibly a banned user and I suspect that RP mistakenly thought it was me putting it back in due to this edit comment  

Does this have anything to do with UserLight current Kyриx  

How did you guess Rockpocket  

The names are familiar and I commented in Fridays admin recall mess Kyриx  

Yall are a pretty useless lot Maybe try supporting deserving editors instead of coddling the disruptive oneseric 

Eric I have discussed the matter with Clio privately and I dont really think my actions today could be described as coddling Rockpocket  

Hm the user has a history of incivility and a talk page full of warnings Looking through his recent edit history reveals many incivil remarks or attacks 101 102 as well as complaints of abuse 103 and vague threats 104 I think this is well beyond what we usually tolerate with respect to wikiquette and have blocked him for 12 hours Radiant 

4 I dont believe a WP3RR warning is a vague threat but rather a proper notice of a Wikipedia policy  

5 Note that with the exception of
