I think this needs a subsection called community

One of the things that residents of Inala think is really important is the community organisations  Inala has a number of  organisations that have helped the suburb develop  There is also a very strong sense of community in the suburb  Any talk about Inala which does not recognise community fails to recognise the character of Inala

Perhaps this could be included in Suburb amenities facilities and services

If we have sub sections for Education churches sporting clubs I wonder at the reason no one has included the Not for Profit Non Government organisations  EG  Inala Community House Hub Neighbourhood Centre PCYC Inala Youth Service
