If you read my previous comments again  I am a new user  And being a new user  I have a request that I would like you to honor

DO NOT CONTACT ME AT ALL  EVER

Your Incivil behavior and your constant harrasment towards me is not appreciated  You might get a hoot out of it but I dont  

I refuse to try to explain anything to you anymore since you clearly read things the way you wish them to be read
I understand that you have alot of administrators in your back pocket and thats fine  Use them wisely
This request comes from me trying to speak with you about your harrasment towards my edits and your dealing poorly with it  So since there is a clear language barrier between us I ask that you dont contact me anymore  Furthermore I ask that you and your buddies believe dr smoos to be one of them leave my edits alone  If my edits are so POV as you harrased me about and there is an apparent concensus about it then let other users correct it  Maybe they will give a reason for it instead of bringing it to this  I ask you to please review the civil harraasment links you have posted so much and also to review the 5 pillars of wikipedia  Many rules and guidelines of wikipedia have been broken during this process  I understand that you would want to so badly to contact me again about this statement  ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY  I will read what you have to say and I will try to remove it from my talk page with no response back to you  I ask that you keep your comment back to me civil and non harrasing  If you feel that me writing this to you is inclivity and harrasing I cant apoligize to you about it because it is NOT  If you feel it is with such passion I ask that you read it again and again until you read it in the correct context and you fully understand what I am requesting  I do not discourage you from editing just ask that you stop harrasing me and my edits  I will never become a member of wikipedia because of people like yourself
