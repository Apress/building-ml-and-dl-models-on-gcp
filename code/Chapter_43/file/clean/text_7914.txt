Vienna 

Dude seriously  WPRS and WPV dont get thrown out the window just because Mary Jo Foley of microsoftwatchcom provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a socalled spokesman about the change in name  Nobody at Microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say Yes the name is Vienna in the last few days  Doesnt that strike you as somewhat odd  We can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team or a page on Microsofts web site  Not this time  Im not going to bother with renaming back to Windows Blackcomb since youll probably change it back to Vienna without bothering with that nagging Wikipedia requirement of verifiability  This isnt a race  
Okay Whats the point of these constant reverts back to Blackcomb Im really sure now that the codename is Vienna The change was recent lets not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere No offense but you seem to like the name Blackcomb much better than Vienna Get over it It was changed Now it wasnt only Scoble who confirmed it My guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason Several sources claim its Vienna so lets keep it that way There were rumours about Longhorn being changed to Vista but later it was confirmed Lets just leave the article alone for right now
