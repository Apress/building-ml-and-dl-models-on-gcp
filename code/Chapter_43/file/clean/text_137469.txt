OK I was waiting to see if things had been fixed before tackling anything   

 WikiProject Community

You are a brilliant individual If you dont join WikiProject Community I will hunt you down and make your life a Living Hell   

Oh crap did I type that I think I had a bit too much rum My apologies What I want to say is that Ive had since I been at wikipedia this notion of a sense of community I thought a community writing about community would be a popular idea and catch on but if you look at the project page history and even the talk page youll see that Im the only one there Look at WikiProjects like WikipediaWikiProject Michigan its like a beehive WikipediaWikiProject The Beatles is probably the most innovative and productive organized group at Wikipedia Its silly that the community builders task force is really just one guy I feel like deleting the whole thing sometimes UserSj was interested and encouraging for a while when we first started it but hes doing wikimania and many other things 

Anyway the community article is coming along very well now Ive created a list of sources at the bottom of the list of community topics and Im listing more as I find them  

the following is copied from CQs talk page

Ah rum  Here I thought wow somebody finally recognizes my unique brilliance  Oh well  I dont think that two makes a community either but Ive been meaning to sign up Ive been involved with communities of various kinds for many years Community is an ephemeral thing really It is the oxygen we breathe and most of us dont stop to think about it I guess thats why there isnt a stampede  It is like the way that people avoid talking about process But lets see Michigan  community of place  The Beatles  community of interest  Hummm something topical  Well there is interest in intentional communities of all kinds and of course ecovillages So maybe that is an angle to begin with Anyway Im in   

Now youre talkin Sunray  Two heads are better than one I think once  and the others see progress on Community articles by quality they may rejoin the effort Im heading over to Virtual community to start shaking things up over there Its an attractive topic and the article is nearly as big a mess as community was Hopefully I can recruit a few members from over there 

Now that the tools are in place we can approach the list as a series based upon importance and public interest Feel free to drop the WikiProject Community tag on as many articles as you like Do you know of a tool that tracks hit counts for wikipedia articles I suppose talk page activity is a pretty good indicator It would be nice to have a tool that can quantify that

TalkVirtual community has a onlinesource tag on it so I think its a good next focus Im threatening to bump that article down to stubclass and stick a rewrite tag on it Maybe that will furrow a few brows Im also thinking of bumping Community up to Aclass but i would like to find another article that can get quickly to Bclass Take a look at Vital articles Any ideas   

PS I meant the brilliance comment 

The brilliance comment certainly got my attention  Seems to me that the next step is knowing what the individuals unique brilliance is hence you begin to get at motivation Positive feedback would then reinforce that motivation Im learning to watch not only what people contribute to but how they contibute Sometime you might tell me what it was you saw that made you say that     

There should be lots of action on Virtual community and related pages The trick will be distinguishing the serious contributers from the drive bys  Wikipedians are browsers and grazers they keep moving through those links watchlists grow and grow
