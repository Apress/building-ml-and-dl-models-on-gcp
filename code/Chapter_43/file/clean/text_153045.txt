Hipocrite I doubt that one isolated incident is evidence of a long history of a pattern of incivility  If there are other examples in recent history Id be happy to evaluate them  But no it doesnt mean that if Pedro slips up 9 months from now hes going to be instablocked for all eternity  And as for being on the recall list Pedro asked me a long time ago if Id have any objections to being on the list and I said no  Thats about it  As far as I am aware being on the list means that I have the option of petitioning Pedro to relinquish his admin privileges nothing more  It doesnt mean Im obligated to stalk all of his edits and make sure hes behaving  At this point I havent seen any evidence that would convince me that he is no longer fit to be an admin  Were the comments uncivil  Of course they were  Do they deserve a desysop or a block  In my opinion unless there is clear evidence that this was more than just an isolated incident of a personal attack then no  Everyone screws up from time to time  We dont desysopblock people because they had a bad day unless it can be shown that theyve been having a bunch of bad days recently and that it is disrupting peoples ability to contribute to the encyclopedia  Frankly and I know you will probably all see this as the cabal protecting itself I see this as a witch hunt against an admin that you dont particularly get along with  If you have a real issue with Pedro and you have real evidence that this is a longterm problem then please present evidence in the form of diffs and I will gladly evaluate it  But Im not going to waste my time searching for it myself because my hunch is that this is not going anywhere   spout _
