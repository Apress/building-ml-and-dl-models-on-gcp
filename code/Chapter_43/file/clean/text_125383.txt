You are doing unusual things
I read some of your explanations about the weird things you are doing to Latin names of plants  I understand that you intend to bring Wikipedia categorization up to botanical standards but since you are making so many unusual changes I would appreciate if you could copy your simplified explanation and keep the full explanation of what you are doing on a registered userpage  You say you have done this before  why is it that you choose not to register so as to keep better communication You definitely are getting a lot of attention Blue Rasberry
