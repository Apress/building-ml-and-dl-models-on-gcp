List of Latter Day Saints
Im afraid I have been ranting on the talk page of this list primarily because I am fed up with the aggressive tactics of our newest batch of policy enforcers and with how policy is developed and disseminated  I noted that you tried to explain a more reasonable perspective and method to our enforcer in your comments and I admire your patience  I would appreciate your comments to my rants if you have any interest  But I am sorry to take up extra space with my most recent tilting at windmills  Best wishes
