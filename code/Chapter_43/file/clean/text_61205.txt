Once again you are selective in your responses and totally ignore important issues for example

You also say that the Rin tin tin Museum was short lived and make not reference as to where this information is substantiated and yet the Museum still exists today

You also say that Jannettia Brodsgaaard Propps amassed a collection of memorabilia which she did not She never collected Anything It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin

There are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page  you apparently did not follow the conflict rules with them Carol Joan and Chelsea  yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogsand allowed their version of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as selfserving as the statements in the Lassie article Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard

I now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011  there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect The call name of the dog is indeed Smith but that is not his registered name He is Rin Tin tin XII We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected 

And again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin  if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldnt you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you It specifically outlines Tierneys involvement as being only limited to a mention He had no direct involvment in the making of the film

I would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue Your argument is that because someone mentions it is a book that it is absolutely true If that is the case then why do you discount other authors books and writings  You defend Orleans writings as though they were your own and discount anyone elses including English That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner

We would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands Shame on you
