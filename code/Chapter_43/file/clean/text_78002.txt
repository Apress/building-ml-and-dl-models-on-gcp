more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy as I think most people can tell  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious which isnt really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic

Maybe I went a bit far  I just object to statements like the entirety of spacetime came into existence at some point unless you define this point embedded in a larger spacetime outside of our own The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements spacetime is everything and something exists outside of spacetime are true However I work in computer software and dont do physics although this is really about philosophy so maybe Im just using the the wrong kind of logic  

If time is finite then there must be a beginning which is what I think is meant by at some point  I dont think the phrase came into existence at some point necessarily implies any metaphysical cause ie thingbeing outside the universe does it  0659 22 Dec 2004 UTC

I wasnt really comfortable with the version that came before it though  First cause is a complex topic or at least a lot has been said about it and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate and maybe link to it from this article that would be good  Im not really qualified to do it

Also and I havent made an edit about this Im uncomfortable as a physicist with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism  While many do and they may be right I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one  Oops  forgot to login  Im misterbailey if anyone was wondering

You are right to question the most astronomers bitIll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces  Ive been working on deterministic system philosophy where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism but it is a complex subject    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up
