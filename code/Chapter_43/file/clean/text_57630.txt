Youll have to my talk page if you want to continue it But just look at something you wrote The Bible itself even claims hundreds of times that what it says is true     1 You wrote CLAIMS Claims means to assert to be true without really even being proof The bible should not claim anything is ture It should assure us that stuff is true 2 Of course if I wrote something I wanted you to believe I would tell you its true a couple of times or heres a better idea Ill write everything and tell you and go oh by the way Im making this all up as Im going along
