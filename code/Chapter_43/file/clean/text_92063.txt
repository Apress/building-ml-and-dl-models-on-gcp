 Wikia links in the SF articles 

Theres little point other than advertising to randomly link to a wikia when an article is already on wikipedia Unless youve got a solid reason for adding a link you shouldnt add it  
Thats fine and dandy but youll find that adding a link to an article for advertising purposes is against wikipedias policies It doesnt help that the articles on the SF wikia are apparently copy and paste from existing articles here which negates them further Sorry but they have to go
