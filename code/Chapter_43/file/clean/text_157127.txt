This says it best

Id like to point out that Im just an aggregator of information Credit goes to the bloggers before me who brought it to light In particular Will Johnson a professional geneaologist obtained records that leave little room for doubt about Matt Sanchezs activities as Excellent Top and No Regrets Massage His website is the most authoritative Ive seen Without Mr Johnsons work this site probably wouldnt exist

By contrast the Wikipedia page on Sanchez is a disaster Wikipedia has allowed Sanchez to edit his own biography to minimize the evidence of his pornography and prostitution It has included material from an evangelical exgay blog while systemically excluding evidence developed by Will Johnson and others In going along with all of this Wikipedia has abandoned any pretense of neutrality and objectivity in its work I urge readers to register at Wikipedia and file their comments in the discussion section of the page dedicated to Sanchez

Elonka et al go back to the First Church of Jesus H Christ Evanglical Liar and ply your trade there You should be ashamed of yourselves
