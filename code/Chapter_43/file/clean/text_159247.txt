Dear Cirt I wish to answer you here as well as on the Afd where I have replaced my comment My comment was in no way intended to be a personal attack Being a channer is just a choice of webforum It really wasnt meant as an attack However I thought that you were very reasonable in your responses to me AfD then I was quite surprised by one particular conversation on your talk page which I took as meaning that you were conversing with other 4chan members on Wikipedia I accept that I may have misinterpreted this conversation
