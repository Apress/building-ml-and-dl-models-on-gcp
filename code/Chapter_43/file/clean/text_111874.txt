IndakingUnike your behavior is unacceptable here  First of all there is no such thing as your article and demanding that people leave your work alone is against the whole idea of Wikipedia  Further I have made a good faith effort to improve the article so it better conforms to Wikipedia style  The text you posted in the original creation of the article was lifted in whole from the Web  it was not written by you and you made no attempt to rewrite it  It was plagiarism and that isnt allowed  Next the text itself was not NPOV  As I have stated earlier it was written with a promotional tone  If you cant understand that I will explain it to you  Wikipedia is not here to promote a show merely to document it  Now evidently youre taking this personally and making attacks sometimes by using another selfadmitted identity and sometimes without being logged in  Id like to see this resolved amicably but if you cant or wont I will ask for others to help resolve this  In short stop acting immature treat others with respect and learn to edit according to WP conventions
