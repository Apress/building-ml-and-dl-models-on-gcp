With regard to your last posting at my talk page Im tired I do not care at all None cares of these underground genres Old Electronic music and New Age fans do not need and do not use Wikipedia as primary source New electronic music fans simply ignore or really cant understand differences and proper analogies between genres So there is no point to fill this gap Though there are thousands people sharing my point of view there is no way to involve them in a battle against younger Wikiusers Feel free to do what you want Wikipedia is only a stupid game Im no longer interested in contributing on these topics Usually users that remove dispute templates are immediately banned but these harrassers arent yet Maybe Wikipedia is theirs and none else has to touch their toy Enjoy it Ill no longer contribute on music genres Bye
