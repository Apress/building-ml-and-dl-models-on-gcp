Hi again 

Sorry to be so slow to respond to your message I dont really know of any other notable monasteries There are probably tons and tons and tons more but I doubt many have much coverage The monastery in Kaya for instance only has one monk that lives there and only part time  I dont think thats notable Maybe one day the Skiu monastery will have an article but I think it will be a long time before anyone digs up sources Today I may do some photo uploading and incorporation into articles well see Ever since getting back from India a week ago I have been sick with a fever And yesterday I got a weird rash all over my body The doctor I went to see doesnt know whats wrong This morning my fever seems to be gone so thats encouraging at least Ah strange tropical illnesses So I mostly have been just laying around feeling sorry for myself and sleeping all the time  Hopefully it will clear up soon  otherwise I have to go see an infectious disease specialist ugh
