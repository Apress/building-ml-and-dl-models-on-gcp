EDITORS PLEASE NOTE 

Im trying to add references and before I even finish typing the information that has already been removed Give the person who writes the addition chance to correct their reference mistake before you remove their entire entry Not everyone who contributes  be it new and veteran know it all  wants to take the time to research factual info so that someone can come in an instant and erase their work  Please be considerate

There was information about pivoting city carriers the distinction between the two the job posiitons of managers and supervisors and a list of postal killings attributed to the violent section that were ALL factual

changes

I am a USPS employee I am not much of an author nor am I a WP expert so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted feel free to fix it but there have been a lot of changes since the sorting mail section was written For one the MLOCRs have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software as well as spray barcodes on the front Also the article seems to give no mention of DPS which is a set of sort programs that take local mail letters only although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats and put it in walking or driving order for carriers to deliver There are also lots of other changes as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information including the LCTS APPS RCS FSM100 and FSM100AI There is also the entire PARS system which is is quite interesting

 Sorry not to be of more help but 
Theres a contradiction between the first section which says the USPS is the thirdlargest employer and the employment section which claims its the secondlargest  I dont know which it is but someone should fix that

Should be the third largest  behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart  I have changed that three times  I will NOT do it again  Preceding unsigned comment added by 24350168   

Removal of Monopoly section
While I removed the Monopoly section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasigovernment enterprise  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms the context of its usage is clearly biased  Historically the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition Furthermore the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article By extension of the posters logic the police fire military the Fed PBS NPR and others are violators of antitrust laws as well  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies its also not  as far as I know  legislated to make a profit  Making the USPS the first monopoly in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete  Please review anarchocapitalism in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is Of course it is Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly The government forbids competition in letter mail by law Being a monopoly doesnt require that youre violating antitrust laws The USPS is whats called a legal monopoly Im going to put the section back in  0125 4 Septem
