If you want to keep anything these days you have to find some mention of the character in Google news archive search  I searched for Avatar the last airbender and then the name of the character  If you look through that and find any details about the character instead of just mentioning a name in a sentence or two then youll be able to save it  Otherwise its a futile effort  Sorry  The Wikipedia has changed the evil deletionists lunatics getting their way  You can find a wikia suited for it though httpavatarwikiacomwikiAvatar_Wiki More than two thousand articles there dedicated to every character and aspect of the series  The wikia is constantly growing in popularity over 30 million hits a month  Anything you are interested in you can find a wikia for or if not you can create a new one quite easily
