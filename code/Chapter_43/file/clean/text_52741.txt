So doesnt Hindi come from Sanskrit If the original meanings have an a at the end then why does Hindi not I mean I understand Hindi might be influenced with some Persian and Urdu But Hindi is still Hindi And doesnt it come from Sanskrit then here So are you sure most of the words should have an a at the end Someone gave me a  link which I opened but for example it said something like I think how Siva  became Siv Now if this is partly due to Persian and  or Urdu influce then well im confused cus in Persia people have the name Shiva So they still kept the a at the end then So what does that mean Does it depend on the word Or what then If you dont mind me asking then Ok thank you here 711058754
