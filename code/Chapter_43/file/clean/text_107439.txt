Welcome to the ninth edition of the WikiProject Eurovision Newsletter 

Were less than a month away from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 and now is the time to make sure that all articles are the best that they can be This is our busiest time and thousands of people will come to Wikipedia and will see our work We need to show them that Wikipedia is a place to come for facts and a site that they can rely on

I cant emphasize enough how important it is for members to take part in discussions on talk pages We have 65 members and usually less than five people step up and comment Editing Wikipedia means is being part of a community Take pride in what you do here and make your positions known

I hope to see you all editing like a storm next month and dont forget to submit news for the next newsletter here

Happy editing   Page Milestones
