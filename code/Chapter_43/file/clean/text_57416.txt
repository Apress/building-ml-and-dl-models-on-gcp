What History Is This
I have never heard of crom being a sun god in fact isnt the complete opposite Form my minor research the twisted maggot was a dark god and lord of the worms not a solar animal whos job it was to recycle the negative energy by ingesting it in much the same way as a worm breaks up the soil thats why people were sacrificed to him because they were usually evilfull of negativity so where all this stuff about him being a sun god and a fertility god is a bit well wrong I suggest the author reads the Slaine comics who at least in this case are genaraly right and have got the jist of it unlike the author of this article
