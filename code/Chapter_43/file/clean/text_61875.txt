Nice straw man but you wont be able to hide behind him  I didnt contact you regarding blocking anyone I contacted you regarding your public service of properly tagging suspected and known sock puppets on their user pages and I did so explicitly  As I indicated it would be your choice of actions has been illuminating
 You would seem to have had the following choices before you
 a Tag all of the confirmed socks as puppets of Hipocrite
 b Tag all of the confirmed but currently untagged socks as puppets of Hipocrite
 c Tag all of the confirmed but currently untagged socks as puppets of PouponOnToast
 d Do nothing at all
 e Do nothing at all and shoot the messenger
 Options a through c would have confirmed your good intentions and the upright nature of your character  You didnt choose any of those  Option d would have been defensible as the Holy crap what have I stepped in option leaving both your intentions and your character in doubt  You didnt choose that option either  You chose option e which is precisely what Hipocrite himself would have done and in so doing you have at the very least exposed your allegiances and bad intentions but more importantly you may have also exposed your true identity as well
