Not sure where to put this But when it takes select quotes from Dwights Speech someone keeps attributing Blood alone moves the wheels of history to Martin Luther King which is completely false First off clues in the episode itself say this is false Jim says he was quoting speeches from historys dictators which MLK was certainly not Beyond that a quick google search reveals that blood alone was used in a speech before the outbreak of WWII to bolster his Italian countrymen while informing them that they had a long journey ahead of them
Martin Luther King might have said it but Mussolini said it first and in the context with the rest of the speech the quote should be attributed to Mussolini a dictator rather than MLK a civil rights activist I will continue to change it until it stops being reverted back to MLK
