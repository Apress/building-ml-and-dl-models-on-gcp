Indonesia 

The majority of present day Filipinos are a product of the long process of evolution and movement of people30 After the mass migrations through land bridges Migrations continue by boat during the maritime era of South East Asia The Ancient races became homogenized into the MalayoPolynesians which colonized the majority of the Philippine Malaysian and Indonesian Archipelagos24 httpenwikipediaorgwikiFilipino_people

The above statement from is a much more balanced approach to the peopling of Indonesia issue that you are having trouble getting your head around The people you call Melanesians werent displaced they assimilated with the newcomers I know many Javanese people who are very dark skinned and would fit right in in New Zealand where I come from or the Pacific and yet they are full Javanese 

So please stop trying to exorcise your political agenda on the Indonesian page and get with the program Taylor is widely discredited in most circles and when I previously tried to post a well thought out statement with multiple sources you VANDALIZED the post and reverted to your myopic and politically charged and ultimately racist rhetoric You present as an enemy of IndonesiaSo get with the program dude 

I am actually a senior university lecturer Head of Department here in Jakarta with degrees in History and Public Policy I specialised in Asia Pacific History so stop being so ignorant and take some advice when you get it

Thank you and have a nice day
