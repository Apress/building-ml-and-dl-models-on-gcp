If  thinks that two wrongs always must make a right he has the right to do so But it takes all credibility out of Wikipedia to keep use incorrect sources only because they in turn copy the same mistake over and over and over and over The system with Swedish military designations are not exclusive to aircraft or engines and have been the same since long before there were aircraft This goes back to at least the 19th century probably more This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years Why do you think its SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricleor even worse the Americanized SK60 The designation system is the same for Army bases Air Force bases Navy bases radar cameras robots airplanes vehicles guns actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible Everything should be conformed the same It should be the same with Wikipedia If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect SK60 as well This goes for all other SAAB aircraft articles in all languages on Wikipedia It has to be either we cant have both Personally I think its easier to change a few incorrect spellings than hundreds that are already correct After all this is about common sense 

Also remember that a commercial website is often made by a webmaster who doesnt really know anything about the subject This is not only true about Volvo Aeros web but also the Swedish Armed Forces website who also have some similar misspellings Sometimes they get it right though ie misspellings are not consistent on their web And yeah even sorces like Janes sometimes get it wrong

Infallible Im not even gonna go that low to answer such a obtuse comment Although it do say a lot about BillCJ himself
