Extraterrestrial hypothesis 

Howdy  You modified some changes I had made to the intro to ETH  I had posted some commentary on the reasons behind the changes on the talk page it would have been nice if you had commented there especially since I left it open for commentary for over a month before I put the change in place   If you disliked the way its written now you should see what it said before I changed it  And just removing the citation which I spent quite some time finding is not very helpful  Anyway other than my slightly bruised ego your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were not talking about ETH but about UFOs  I will try to change it to reflect that  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study but they dont really comment much on ETH  Eg the notion that theres even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong  And leaving the comment a few scientists  is zero info since you can pretty much find a a few scientists supporting any notion  I will post a version of this comment on the ETH talk page please follow up there if after my next edit you still disagree with the text
