Tragedy vs Massacre
Considering the fact that no thirdparty source refers to these events as a massacre I think we need to move the title to Khojaly tragedy to avoid any POV here Massacre is defined as an indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people British journalist Thomas De Waalthe one credible thirdparty that is heavily mentioned in article says that the tragedy in Khojaly was a result of a chaotic situation and not a deliberately planned action by the Armenians Even those who wish to ascribe full blame on the ArmenianKarabakh side cannot argue that this attack was a planned event The tragedy took place during the Battle of Khojaly 

Helsinki Watch notes Helsinki Watch reported that the militia still in uniform and some still carrying their guns were interspersed with the masses of civilians HRW states Human Rights Watch noted that the attacking party ie Karabakh Armenian forces is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties These killings while immensely tragic and unjustified were clearly collateral damage during the battle
