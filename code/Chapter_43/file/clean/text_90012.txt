Depending on whom you ask I can assure you someone out there would like to list whatever YOU believe in as pious fiction  Thats the very reason why we have a WPNPOV policy here which I suggest you read

On a related note the existence of this article has been and should still be regarded as basically an end run around our NPOV policy and I would still support its deletion since it will always be little more than an oped or opinion piece camouflaged as a wikipedia article  talk
