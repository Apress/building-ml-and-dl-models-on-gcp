Toys R Us Color Schemes Since 1969 

Does anyone here know of the exact colors Toys R Us had used for its letter scheme 

Please allow me to start off by saying that according to this link  the original color scheme of the TOYS Я US lettering was a red T a yellow O a light blue Y a pink S a lime green Я an orange U and a rich blue S

The same link mentions that in 1986 this scheme changed to the following the T was still red but the O was now orange the Y now dark green the first S now purple the Я now yellow the U now green and the last S now light red This scheme would remain unchanged through 19992000 This version of the logo also has a shiny sparkled look to it
