How long ago the article was nominated doesnt matter the fact remains that it was nominated because of the addition of BS like lists of their notable members and game debut basically information that is fancruft and by no means needs to be added in the article You cant give me one good reason why this information should remain in the article Its entirely too inuniverse as well your edits make the article subject look like it was real instead of a piece of fiction Go read the umbrella policies of WPFICT If you cant give me good support for your actions Im reverting the article     Chat wit me    Contributions
