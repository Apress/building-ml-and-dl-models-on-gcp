 Peer Review 

I missed the following comments which have been available for a few days and have put them here so that all is clear  please put them back if this is not procedure A few brief comments

 R says there is a way to go on WPMOS which is his area of expertise I assume if we address each of his points one by one then that should improve matters He does not suggest going for GA but that is still an option
 He thinks the UN references look reliable  but not sure if this is a comment on npov too
 Perhaps we need additional comment on the subject area npov and other aspects of the article as well as WPMOS etc
