The Late 

I appreciate you giving a solid argument on the Nancy Reagan page about referring to the dead as the late  A vast majority of articles at this point dont have it so it isnt good form  I reverted the article again as someone changed it from your edit  I am attempting discussion here Wikipedia talkWords to avoid and if you could pipe in I would appreciate it  Thanks
