In the long term yes However at the moment my main concern is the complete lack or sparsity of information concering ship classes Id like to make sure theres no redlinks for any modern ship classes certainly not for anything major since World War 2 Id also like there to make sure that what information is out there is presented in a straightforward accurate and common style Its a huge task but something I feel I would best serve wikipedia doing So back to the point right now it is my feeling that an article on naval estimates is just adding to the work to be done but its definitely something to put on a to do list Really should set up a project but havent the knowledge of how to do so at the moment  Talk
