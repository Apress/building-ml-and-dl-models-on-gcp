One source YOU ARE THE ONE PUSHING A POV Not accepting ANY SOURCES that state he was LEBANESE Im the one accepting your sources as well as mine Blocked Not surprised Beginning to understand why hardly anyone outside of Wikipedia trusts it   

Edit warring Show me where Because I was not  

Rlevse you really are a racist you know Also Im Not even an Arab lol Furthermore Do not put words in my mouth GOT IT Your just so blinded by your hatred its incredible and laughable    
If you look at the history of the article you can see that you repeatedly undid others edits despite there being no conesnsus for your edit That is edit warring When there is no consensus for your version the correct procedure is to restore the article to the status quo discuss the issue and change the article again only if you gain consensus for your edits Furthermore comments such as the above are unconstructive and are not conducive to a positive atmosphere   

Firstly I would really like to thank you for your kind response here  As for me calling Rlevse racist thats what it looks like from the way he seems obsessed with keeping out any Lebanese claims About edit warring The edit warring article says this Edit warring is the confrontational combative nonproductive use of editing and reverting to try to win manipulate or stall a discussion or coerce a given stance on a page without regard to collaborative approaches and also Typically a user who edit wars is ignoring editorial norms reverting rather than taking due consideration of the points made by others But it also says It states that a user who makes more than three revert actions of any kind on any one page within a 24 hour period may be considered to be edit warring and blocked appropriately usually for a 24 hour period for a first incident
Now there was no edit war going on on the article in question

As you can see my first edit was at  0027 31 August 2009 which was when I added the note The edit right after that was me improving the note I had added Right after this second edit Rlevse reverts my edits After he does so I revert his revert and ask that he keep it the way it is while the topic is in discussion That was it There was no edit war 4 Reverts  an Edit war That was only 1 And even if you wish to count all the edits that was only 3 and not 4   

I have extended your block to indefinite  your account appears to only exist to push a POV and disrupt the Wikipedia community Calling a user a racist is unacceptable   Talk
