Oh lord spare us Your side makes out that its just a slur aimed at the Israeli government and then you complain that its also used for other Zionists Lots of people call expansionists Zionists not just neoNazis and Islamists although they are well represented as doing so on Google And few people would use the phrase Zionist terrorists who arent so describing the government and armed forces of Israel and its true that the combination is unlikely to be much seen in mainstream work because its rare that governments of any kind are described as terrorists in mainstream publications But the phrase is used and it is used by people outside those mentioned And its not necessarily true that it has fallen into disrepute more original research  you simply will not source any of this stuff will you so much as it has never been much used I dont doubt that There are relatively few Zionist terrorists Given the nature of terrorism thats hardly a surprise There arent many American terrorists either
