I agree with George  The article has a significant bias  Just because two or three editors that do nothing but patrol this page and make hundreds of posts does not mean that your interpretation of the scientific consensus interpretation by the editors here is the same  For those of you in academia you can read this peer reviewed study for free here  shows initial data that something remains in water long after all material is gone  No matter what your thoughts unless you think the Nobel prize winner is just lying this is pretty intriguing stuff  He filters out all know bacteria even to 15th of the size and then takes the water and regrows the original bacteria  With many types of bacteria  He even notes that it must be succussed  Whether or not it has anything to do with homeopathy doesnt change the marvel of what this first look into this new type of data holds as it is very interesting  I chuckle to see the anonymous layperson editors immediately discrediting nobel prize winners research because they must be a quack  You are writing in wikipedia  Which means you probably dont have a real job in science or you would be doing that as opposed to sitting in the homeopathy page in wikipedia  

Lastly Brunton  You are not consensus and in general I disagree with almost all of your points and your inability to process anything but your own biased viewpoint over and over  You need to take a rest and let other people post  We have all heard MORE than enough from you and we clearly understand your position  A consensus is multiple editors and you have used all of your turns and then some  Take a break and stop trying to overpower this article just due to the fact that you are overtly biased and seem to have nothing else to do  I would like to hear from multiple other editors  Preceding unsigned comment added by 651002177
