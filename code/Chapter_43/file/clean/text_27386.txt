PS In response to canvassing I think such accusations are once again biased We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it but nothing happens because she is supporting the status quo Canvassing for the status quoacceptable Canvassing for a minority positionunacceptable This despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account unless those views represent an extreme margin And in this case Wikipedia may have erred From BBC to ABC Cambridge University to UCLA my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media Yet Im being voted off the island by persons such as MLA who doesnt know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself not just Wikipedia Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society We still in the majority value violence and sports over academic pursuits Football soccer basketball players all make much more than college professors even the best and brightest in the field Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia but society itself

Finally again FYO I am more than two but slightly less than three standard deviations above the average IQ and therefore I see fit to say that I like Michael C Price and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average we can still see the groundwork of one order of magnitude higher Of course an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system which I see as having quite many flaws I do hope that these types of essays will lead to constructive improvements in the future

Sincerely
Robert Young
