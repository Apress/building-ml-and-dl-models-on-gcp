 Character bios 

It is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article Also its not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia Ive seen at least so I am going to go ahead and delete them  talk 

I have just added the Zuka Club to the supporting characters section I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge Im not so good with adding pictures  especially when I have none  or Japanese kanji Is there anyone who can add these  

Well I added the clubs section and a pic for each club and Ill get to the kanji for Zuka next  talk 

 Cool Nice choice of pictures  

Ive added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the supporting characters section Do you guys think its too much  And if not could someone add the kanji and a picture

I added her picture but I dont know where to find the kanji for Kotoko  talk 

They should be visible in the fansub of episode 19 theres a scene of Ranka and Kotoko Haruhi inside when Ranka is having a flashback I cant read kanji myself but the translation for the caption text said thats what it says

 Japanese Title 
While glancing through the edit history I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted I can only speculate on how much they actually knew but the change made and then reverted wasnt involved with katakana at all as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部 which is kanji

Now Im not all that fluent in the language but Ive seen no record of 部 being directly romanized into kurabu  I have heard the characters use both hosutobu ホスト部 and hosuto kurabu ホストクラブ at different times fairly interchangably but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that Im not aware of  

Ive since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and mangas titles hence the confusion  the loanword kurabu isnt normally a given reading for the kanji  However in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud so there is still a difference there  What would be the suggested method to approach this given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouranrelated pages including the Episode title list  

Ill be glad to clear this up for you If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters The last 3 of which spell out kurabu hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again  talk 

Yes the furigana as I noted later  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji  without the furigana as a guide bu would be the
