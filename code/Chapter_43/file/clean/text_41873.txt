Dear Llinus if I may call you that
Thank you for your reasoning on KV55 I cant say I disagree with it though I thought including a reference to the difficulties of using modern forensics to date ancient mummies was usefulto illustrate how impossible it was to claim the mummy was just a young person when he died The Gabolde note though is quite correct since it does place undue weight on the views of one scholar when there are so many differing views on the KV55 king Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenatens titulary Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun Yes I really cant see who else the KV55 mummy can be except Akhenaten this could be settled if modern forensics didnt give us so strange results for the Egyptian mummies

As an aside you are quite right that wiki is not perfect It has several flawsthe chief one being vandalism and then WPOR contributions by some crackpots yes Hatshepsuts article was vandalized again But there are a few plusses at least with wiki one can create articles on many fairly obscure temples or archaeological sites such as Trajans Kiosk Amada Temple of Beit elWali or Kiosk of Qertassi In every case I created the articles and managed to source images for them from flickr users who were happy to see them used on Wikipedia I hope you like them If you check Brittanica however I doubt they would bother to even create an article on such minor sites Thank You
