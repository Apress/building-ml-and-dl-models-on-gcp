Request for Usurpation

Hello Zsuetam A request has been made at WikipediaChanging usernameUsurpations to usurp or take over your username because you have not used it to edit and another user would like to use it to edit WikipediaChanging usernameUsurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given an opportunity to object and does not do so 

If you have an email set in your preferences you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have please log in and post a reply here saying so you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to or we will provide you with a generic one 

If you do nothing the request may be filled shortly and your account will be moved to a generic username You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time

If you object to being renamed please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped you can still edit and your data will not be lost your preferences watchlist and other user settings will be transferred to a new username

Thank you for your time xenotalk
