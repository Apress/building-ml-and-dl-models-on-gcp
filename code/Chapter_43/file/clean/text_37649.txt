We are the East Maitland Eagles our club is part of Maitland This is a page on Maitland and I encourage other sporting clubs who represent the area to have their part on the home page of Maitland Page includes Groove in the Moo which is an event run by Sydney promoters for profit and appears on here obviously that is notable enough for youAlso the Morpeth Jazz festival didnt get moved to a seperate Morpeth page or the High Schools like Maitland High and Grossman High I didnt see them get moved to an East Maitland page or Rutherford High get moved to a Rutherford page You are being petty and have had a bee in your bonnet since my inclusion of East Maitland Eagles Maitland is a town that includes its suburbs and you are trying to divide themVery petty and very vindictiveYou pushed for sources I provided them once that was settled you took this angle get over it
