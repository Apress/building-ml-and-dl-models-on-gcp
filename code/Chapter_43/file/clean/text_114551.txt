Some of these sound like an obvious hoax often quite ridiculously so So Id request citations for them Please Thanks  

Certianly some of the entires are hoaxeg the entry national fruit states ambmango Although mango may rightly be the national fruit amb is not even an Urdu word for mango The word come from Punjabi and definitely it was never declared by Pakistani government that amb is the natioanl fruit I am removing this entry for the least 

Similarly national reptile is translated as Qaumi MagarMach which stands for national crocodile in Urdu Indus is called Sindh in Urdu not Sindhu which is much more of a local language namenickname National marine mammal is translated as Qaumi machlee which infact stands for national fish Indeed these are ridiculous
