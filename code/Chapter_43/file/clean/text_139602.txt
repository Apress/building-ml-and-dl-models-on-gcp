I have kept all of it but it clearly states at the very beginning that andalism is any addition removal or change of content in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia That is what you are doing by removing Kathy from her page and refusing to add Pauline You are compromising the integrity of the Wikipedia page I have watched EastEnders religiously from the very beginning since I was 9 I even applied to be a writer for the show a couple of years back Trust me I know what I am talking about and you need help Kathy has been crucial to Lucy Beales storylines from the very beginning please watch some old episodes that is my homework for you How long have you been watching the sho 2007 On the other hand Pauline has been very involved in the affairs of the Beales seeing as she was a surrogate grandmother and the head of the family Personally my view is that the family infobox is too narrow and I know that others agree but I am willing to work within consensus So just stop being stubborn and let the will of the sensible overrule please
