Please pardon me if its a stupid question as I havent really done a lot of work with categories in the past But does that sort of change really need a CfD I think that if I had found myself with a similar subcat idea I would have just gone ahead and done it or more likely thrown it at a relevant project talk page to see if there were objections Of course maybe you werent able to get consensus at the project hence the post to CfD Again sorry if this seems stupid  as I branch out into new and different tasks I just like to understand the thinking of people who are engaged with them more regularly I find it helps me with my own decisionmaking
