Hi Osorin I deleted the article because it didnt assert why the web service is notable There is a bunch of things I can link you to where you can read more for example mainly WPA7 an WPWEB but also pay attention to WPN and if you are somehow related to the company that supplies the service WPCOI The best way to demonstrate notability is by showing there exist independent reliable sources that provide significant coverage on the subject Every part of that phrase matters so the sources have to be independent of the subject they have to be reliable sources according to Wikipedia standards the main part of that is there has to be editorial review of the sources see WPRS and they have to be about Teamness itself not just mention it I myself presumed there were none because the article didnt state why it is important so that there would be sources about it but I always love to be proven wrong on this See also WPWMD
