NOP 

MORDORS Jewish beliefs make his version of the article neutral  I dont think so but Im ready for compromise as on the discussion page I made article neutral without POV sentences and non referenced statements  Mordors criticism about the party I think that ban was not needed to solve this problem I would like to remind you of Mordors actions and that his beliefes influence Wikipedias articles from up to down I dont have anything against Jews my uncle is a practicising Jew but I think that Mordor have to stop spreading only his point of view on Polsih related articles Please look at article about NOP now

I agree with Mordors Criticism which is higlhy positive to keep criticism on anything in Wikipedias articles because nothing is perfect but criticism with head and NPOV policy
