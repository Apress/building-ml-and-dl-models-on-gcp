It has been over two months since this block has lasted During this time I have had time to reflect and see the support and recognition my work here at Wikipedia has been given See above The last block was in all honesty misinterpreted For the Handball at the 2011 Pan American Games an article which I greatly contributed to I believed it was better to standardize across all the sport subpages So that is what I did and proposed the image to be deleted because it was not going to be in use The only other image I proposed to be deleted was the wrong logo of a proposed bid It was never my intention to edit war but again GB fan felt otherwise to revert everything I did even when I left valid explanations I was frustrated at the time and over the past two months have cooled down and am ready to return to the project TalkContributions
