I was acting on the advice of the admin who blocked you The responses have a great deal of value particularly as theyre from experienced editors rather than SPAs with fewer than 500 edits  talk contributions 
I agree with Carl and other users that it is important for material to be properly sourced and to avoid original research and synthesis I was concerned with the first sentence in the section Spin added
For centuries the common story of the birth of Jesus has been a product of the two birth narratives in Matthew and Luke but it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material so in order to clarify the relationship between them the basic elements are compared in the following table
The assertion that it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel is a matter of opinion and needs an inline citation refering to a reliable source Same thing for the assertion because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material According to whom Once again it needs to refer to a reliable source
It may be more productive to show the suggested section and table on this talk page or on a subpage and then have editors comment and work through differences before adding the material into the article At present theres no consensus to add the material which means that Spin puts something in and then another editor like Carl removes it In situations like this its best to slow down follow 1RR and work through issues through talk page conversations Alternatively third opinions or other dispute resolution mechanism may help Cheers  
For the moment I have removed the introductory comment and left the original statement Ill just remind you of all the Christmas creches which depict the shepherds and the magi together all the paintings which do the same the comments here of people who cannot accept the scholarly opinion that Matthew has Joseph living in Bethlehem only to move to Nazareth at the end of the narrative 
I dont understand how a person will work through issues when they have successfully erased the material One needs to be constructive to make progress on Wiki not destructive It is the dialog which allows progress If a person doesnt want to enter into a constructive dialog then it doesnt matter how one proceeds 
So how about it Carl Bunderson can you be constructive on the issue  control 
I have been constructive until I am blue in the face Youve no sense of how OR RS and primary sources all interact A clear majority of persons have indicated that your edits are inappropriate you merely obstinately refuse to acknowledge it Talking to you does absolutely no good  talk contributions 
You have not been at all constructive You dont use the notion of primary sources as indicated in the material Ive already quoted All youve done is to opine that it is OR which it plainly isnt You dont give constructive indications as to how to improve the material Constructive indications involve proposing alternatives that would make the material acceptable to you As to primary sources again this is what Wiki says
Primary sources that have been reliably published for example by a university press or mainstream newspaper may be used in Wikipedia but only with care because it is easy to misuse them Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation Without a secondary source a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable educated person without specialist knowledge For example an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source
I make no conclusions about the material I dont make any interpretations of the material You seem to me to simply be wrong in your interpretation of the rules  control 22
