Hello 

The plagiarism is from the book Mythological Women which I cited as a reference when I first created this article  The material Jack the GiantKiller has repeatedly inserted into the article while also citing to the book via footnotes tracks the relevant passage in Mythological Women pointforpoint and often wordforword  If you look at my edit of 2214 14 June 2008 I quoted the relevant passage in its entirety  By comparing the quote which Jack promptly deleted to Jacks paraphrase you will see the basis for my objection that his version is plagiarism
