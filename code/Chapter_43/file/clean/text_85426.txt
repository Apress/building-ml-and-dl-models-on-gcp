it does not matter whether the bulk of information flow was one direction or another THE PURPOSE OF THE GFDL IS TO ENSURE THAT ANY EDITS RELEASED UNDER GFDL NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT OR MINOR ARE PROPERLY ATTRIBUTED WHEN USED ELSEWHERE This includes proofing rearranging spelling change of syntax style etc and is not limited solely to content
