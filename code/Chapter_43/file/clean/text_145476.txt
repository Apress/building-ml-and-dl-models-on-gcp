Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

There was a revert war going on in that article I added a section which shows other scholarly opinions which suggest most Ancient Greeks did not practice homosexuality It was immediately reverted even though I gave sources The only reason they had was because it was done by a sockpuppet If YOU go to that article and go to history and revert to the last edit by james577 we can add some truth to it And they wont have an excuse since you are not a sockpuppet You are a proud Greek and you should do it
