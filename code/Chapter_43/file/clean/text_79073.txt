Hey you are preaching to the choir here dude   Remember this one  I couldnt find anything solid about it at the time except for that NTV gag report  How tempting it must have been to assume the place is not notable beyond its funny name eh  Well eat this  The site itself is hardly a reliable source but its a very good illustration of what kind of information is available out there  And every other shabbyRussianvillagepopulationfive is going to have at least as much written about it over the years  Its not that there are no sources its that there are often no easily accessible sources  What that is so hard to understand to some is beyond me  yo May 19 2010 2147 UTC
