Adviretisement on Wikipedia 

Hey Jimbo Im here to recommend an ad style We need money to keep up the good work Donations may not hold it still We cant risk Wikipedia So instead of ad spots and annoying popups we can take sponsors for external links There are aready thousands of ad style links Why not add one to links and support the encyclopedia For example game articles theyd be an opportunity Links like a Steam link will be enlightening too You can count all commercial and information providing sites
