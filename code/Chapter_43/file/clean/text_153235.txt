This is really getting ridiculous Because since Nomoskedasticity wont be inundated by Keravelt for a few days  he resorts to propogating  his own NONNEUTRAL views in the article
a He completely ignores the fact that there are views that specifically contest him being CEO his attorney and the governement b He flagrantly misinterprets the Gazette article as reporting Sholom Rubashkin to be the COO where else did he come up with that idea while the article clearly reports the US attorneys admitting that they misreported him as CEO you have not quoted anything to suggest that what I had proven was original research this all while Mosmof is guessing this is the sort of minutiae that the defense lawyers  so I could live with his title listed as CEO  Original Research c He then blankly changes the third paragraphs repeated references to Sholom Rubashkin from Vice President to CEO CEO is contested while Vice President isnt  d He changes my clarification of Sholom Rubashkins exit that it is disputed by a seocndary source to simply Sholom Rubashkin left his post in September 2008 e He fails to even explain himself in all this
And no one raises any concern about a Neutral Point Of View

I am reverting it to my previous edit which is far more accurate than this one it just omits sources that have been called innaccurate by both his Attorney and the US Attorney
