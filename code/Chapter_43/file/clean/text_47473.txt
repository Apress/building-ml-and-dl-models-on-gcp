Spitfire Stuff 

No problem I for one wouldnt say it was a attack I can see this is a sensitive subject for you I think that you misunderstand my intentions as you do Minorhistorians The trouble centres around the attempt by one person to rewrite the history of ths machine in a way that implies it was troublesome to operate and somewhat inferior to the German types My posts were not connected the losses of the Spitfire or the pilots that flew them for the most part Contrary to Rlandmanns comments I will not voluntarily stand back from anything if I see a flagrant injustice whether it be in the article itself or me personally I guess he and I are different breeds Regards
