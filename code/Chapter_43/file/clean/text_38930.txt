It is interesting to see how this debate has never ceased

When this article was named Myanmar for a long time there was no real debate over the name of the country When a small group of wikipedians allowed their emotions to get over their heads and moved this article to Burma right after the height of the 2007 Burmese antigovernment protests which if you checked the details it showed that the entire moving process was pushed through before most people noticed it the naming debate has ensued continuously for a full four years and running

I believe this itself says alot about his classic example of a flaw in the way wikipedia is being exploited by a minority group in the face of widespread opposition all in the name of political correctness which goes against wikipedias core policies of WPNPOV Over 90 of ProBurma supporters may not always express it outright but it is clear politics was at play Conversely over 90 of ProMyanamr supporters where hardly supportive of the current political regime but simply found this a huge joke on the internet or like me were trying to defend wikipedias core values of NPOV

It is such a shame that I have teenage students using this incident as an lasting example of why Wikipedia can never be trusted as a viable research source Today wikipedia is the only source on Earth which states that the largest city of Burma is Yangon I can sympathise with people when they laugh at this anomaly
