Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18July2009 These recent events have just reconfirmed what Ive been telling people for years Wikipedia runs on mobocracy despite other people claiming for years No no WP decisions are made per logical reasoning in accordance with written policies Well actually thats not how decisions have been made for several years as of July 2009 Im not quite sure what the problem is with the wikimasses in this attitude that truth is a popularity contest There cant be a massive multiyear wikicabal so I suspect these mobjudgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to thinkMany school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people In America people are not allowed typically to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education where they must pass standards of clear thinking Not just anyone can sit on the bench and start making decisions that affect thousands of other peopleWe have to write realitybased guidelines with totally obvious examples so that anyone could understand them The wikimasses dont follow concepts such as significant coverage in reliable sources I must conclude the current WP policies are like wikicalculus for the masses They cannot calculate wikiintegrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion Hence the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editorsSo these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time rehashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed I dont think theres any other hope Most people just dont understand the current policy points no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions They see NOTINHERITED and thats the extend of their reading 2 words is a policy to them Perhaps they started to read the policy text yawn and rezoned to the 2 words period

To be readable we must list obvious examples such as the oneevent RMS Titanic generating 50 notables Plus those examples must be listed in easytoread essays no consensus required so when we put WPBIGEVENT they know that historically big single events have generated numerous notables eg Lee Harvey Oswald  Jack Ruby in JFK assassination Charles Manson  Manson family in Sharon Tateetc murders Its the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions to the intricate policies must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes No instead bigevent notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting
