Your input would also be appreciated as to the general fairuse of the image itself both in the article mainspace and the portal mainspace  I still dont think enough of a fairuse rationale is given even though the uploader removed it from the portal space  And even though the uploader had removed it from that portal page your input at Portal talkJournalismSelected quote66 would also still be helpful for the edification of the other editor in the discussion on that talk page  Thanks
