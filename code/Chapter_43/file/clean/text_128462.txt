I also changed to Novorossiya Governorate It is just overall linguistic logic using Novorossiysk Governorate implies reference to the city of Novorossiysk which is confusing for 2 reasons first there is now a big city in Russia of such name secondly the name of the Novorossiya Governorate implied reference to Novorossiya as is clear from the fact that the renaming of the province preceded the renaming of city Ekaterinoslav
