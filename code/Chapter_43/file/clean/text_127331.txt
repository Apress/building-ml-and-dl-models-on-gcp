I am deeply embarrassed that I carelessly used this offensive phrase Turn up your hearing aid  I will try to do better   

I appreciate seeing your selfintrospection  It helps me  I know that recently I often cross the line with John Foxe when it comes to WPAGF and WPNPA  

I respect this hell continue his wrong behavior Ill continue my wrong behavior nothing will get fixed So Im pressing this to a conclusion With this kind of attitude good will happen I am sure of it  I hope JF takes his own responsibility as seriously  Thanks for taking the time to communicate with me   1707
