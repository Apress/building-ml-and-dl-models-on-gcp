Numerous undos 

Are you sure people can still see the blue or green colours if they actually go on Urnaus and Neptune Whats up with these
 Ive ask the WPRD its all  who is dowloading me those informations I dont expect any sunlight to go to Uranus and Neptune so the best term to say the sky is black How you know Uranus and neptune is not that pitchblackdark On Mars I was learnt to not notice the orange color Ive ask the WPRD its what SteveBaker said I beleive and lets hope SB is doing a good job giving me accurate informations6922814550  
Greetings  As I indicated in the edit summaries some of your statements are totally incorrect this casts doubt on the accuracy of your edits generally  In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing even incoherent or unrelated statements  Substandard English is a large part of the problem  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles rather than work on Wikipedia alone    

Please keep in mind that substantial changes should be sourced regardless of who is giving you information  Be careful not to add or substitute information that represents original research  Also you might want to read WPFIVE as a basic introduction to Wikipedia policies   

How you explain  and  You said my information I add to Uranus and Neptune is not right The sunlight on Uranus and Neptune is like 50 to 100 feet away from candle 400 and 900 times dimmer sunlight O my god thats alot  Its like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit Thats like a candle light halfway down my high school campus I hadnt found any information about uranus and Neptunes total blackness6922814550  
I do not think you have read what I wrote above or studied the policy pages I linked to  If you intend to edit Wikipedia articles be prepared to provide reliable sourcing not information from the reference desk or your own interpretations  It is clear you are learning the fundamentals of astronomy for the first time  I question whether you are ready to contribute constructively to a sophisticated scientific article at this time  If you insist upon doing so and go on in the same manner as before your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science and also to concentrate on improving your command of English   

Then how you know Jupiters sunlight is 27 times fainter Thats what you fix by then would that mean Jupiter is 27 times dimmer Less sunlight thne the planet is dimmer Then reflect sunlight just like our rocky planets they dont make their own light Same thing as why nighttime on earth is always black our ground is always black at night You said the statement suppose to be source then how you got those informations from6922814550  
It simply comes from the inverse square law  The mean distance of Jupiter from the sun is  approx 52 astronomical units whose square is 27 a bit more accurate than 25 based on 5 AU Bear in mind that that is incident light  The brightness of the planet also depends on its albedo phase etc
