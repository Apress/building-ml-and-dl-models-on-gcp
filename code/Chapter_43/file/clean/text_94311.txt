I reverted some of your edits to Mike Erickson because they did not comply with Wikipedias policy on neutral point of view when presenting his positions Also cutting and pasting text from campaign literature such as the biographical information from his website violates Wikipedias copyright policy I reworded some of that but if you have more detail like date and place of birth more information on his career specific policy positions and so forth that you can provide in your own words and which can be cited from reliable sources that would be good information for this article Please let me know if I can help Thanks
