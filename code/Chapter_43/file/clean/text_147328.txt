Hi I did a little work on this article as you requested Unfortunately I do not have a desk at the AMNH museum and therefore I cannot get free access to the journals which have the best obituaries of Gordon online instead each one requires a fee to be paid And although I know quite a lot about mollusks and malacologists I know very little about Crustacea and carcinologists If something else occurs to me over time I will make more contributions to this article If you want to reply to this please do so on my talk page thanks Best to you
