Mjroots I have no comment for ANI You decide whether to unblock me or not As I said Even now Im the most reliable source in case of GWI 9525 analysis
 Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the planes altitude from 38000 feet to 100 feet according to Flightradar24 a website that tracks aviation data CNN
 Who said it did not have the faintest idea how autopilot of A320 working So called reliable sources that you use are making from total amateurs DESCENT of Flight 9525 is done in autopilot OFF mode and data from Flightradar24 showed changing altitude from 38000 feet to 100 feet are only side artifact that does not matter at all Worst nowadays is how technically illiterate are people that do specific technical job Of the competence of those people you count on when you traveling by plane every day This is already frightening
Not sure about that 100 But youre saying this analysis by Dieter Scholz was the source of his comments Martinevans123 talk  
I dont understand how someone will ask such question at all 

    1 The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time
    2 The cause must be prior to the effect
    3 There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect Tis chiefly this quality that constitutes the relation 

Read carefully what I wrote You even have no idea how many of the other things Ive written may be also true and correct You should not be surprised by surprise twist Who is the killer and who is the victim None of you heard records from CVR yet and may be soon or never you dont hear It If I were the parents of this boy and all blame my son that he is a terrorist  I would now go to the media and to require investigators to launch this record not only to talk about it How much more profitable for Lufthansa is to accuse yong boy instead MAIN PILOT who may be the real suicide person with real message to Lufthansa before he die on CVR The question is What will Lufthansa lose if the truth is that one of its pilot commit suicide because of disagreement with the policy of the company  and at what cost Lufthansa will try to keep it secret
