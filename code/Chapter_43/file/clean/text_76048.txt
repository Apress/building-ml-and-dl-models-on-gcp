Personal Information on your UserpageTAB
Hi  I dont intend to scare you away or attempt to intimidate you but I thought you might want to reconsider some of the items on your userpage You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release personal information about yourself real name or age etc which could be used against you in the future While 99 of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly welcoming and harmless there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so highminded A handful of editors have even felt realworld implications due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information 

I have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display As a result the information is only available to administrators You are of course welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum If you wish to to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it I can request oversight on your behalf You are also welcome to discuss this with me on my talk page or privately via email if you have any concerns Hope to hear from you    talk
