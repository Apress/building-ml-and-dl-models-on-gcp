Relative prevalence of savantism 

This may be a tangent to a previous discussion and I was going to place it in Autistic Savant but this article seems to get more attention 
Is there any research that demonstrates that savantism is more prevalent among autists than in the general population It seems to me that nonautistic people can have extraordinary abilities as well and those might go underreported as theyre not as interesting as the autistic savant
