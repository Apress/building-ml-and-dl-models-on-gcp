Oh yes there are quite a few ways to handle that sort of thing At its simplest click on the history tab to see a list of all the edits made to an article in reverse chronological order Then click on the datetime of the last good edit to see the page as it used to be in this case that would be click on the 2215 9 September 2005 edit by UserTsemii but avoid clicking on the username itself Now click edit this page and in addition to the normal edit box you should also see a warning at the top that you are editing an out of date version of the page Thats OK in this case it is what you want Dont make any changes to the text just enter an edit summary like reverting to last good version by xxxx or rv test press the save page and you are done
Another way is to bring up the page history then click on the word last to the left of the bad edit This should bring up a page like this highlighting differences made by the bad edit You can get a similar page by clicking the diff link from your watchlist Then clicking on Revision as of 2215 9 September 2005 at the top of the left panel will take you to the earlier good version and you can make a null edit and save as before The advantage of using this page difference approach is that there are also links to go forward and back to newer and older edits So if a vandal has made a series of bad edits you can keep stepping back until you reach a good version of the article before editing and saving to revert to that version
If a user is looking like being a problem you can drop them a note on their talk page asking them to stop There are a number of templates for boilerplate warning messages which escalate from  to  Typically if a user has recently had one of the earlier test warning you add the next one in the sequence and sign it However if you are reaching test4 its a good idea to get an admin involved because the next step is to block them
If you have the time you can also check the users other contributions to see whether they have been messing up any other pages and if they have revert those pages too However if they look like being a particularly busy vandal its usually best to get help from an admin at WikipediaVandalism in progress because admins have some extra rollback buttons to make it much easier to undo a large number of changes
Ive reverted the particular edit at Agricultural machinery but this one just looks like a harmless test so no further action was needed Many anon users still find it hard to believe that their changes really are for real and immediately visible to everyone So we see a lot of random edits like this
