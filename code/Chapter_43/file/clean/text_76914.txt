Jai Raj K 

Hi RyanGerbil10 I am Jai Raj K I am not a sock of anybody If RS100 and I were same why would I vote Keep on AfD I supported List of nontheists because I think we can add people on List of nontheists who we cannot add on List of atheists and List of agnostics I cannot believe that Nick Graves my old friend has accused me of sockpuppetry I do not know about the email discussion between RS100 and Nick Graves I dont want to say anything negative about Nick Graves because of this misunderstanding After all he is my old friend I have made mistake in the past and this account is certainly not a throwaway account Nick Graves has told the name of my country This is not fair If you want to block me block me But please remove the name of my country What should I do Should I simply retire this account and create another one Please give me a good suggestion Thank you
