Move to Marie Leczinska 

Since English language obviously doesnt have its own name for this woman Mary Leszczyńska Anglophone historians have to choose between Polish spelling  Maria Leszczyńska  and French spelling  Marie Leczinska French language was and still is naturally closer to English than Polish which is probably why most Anglophone historians choose Marie Leczinska A quick Google Book Search confirms this Maria Leszczyńska gets 96 Englishlanguage results though all Ive seen are Polish books while Marie Leczinska gets 808 Englishlangauge results

Besides being closer to an Anglophone for whom the article is written the proposed title has another benefit the lack of diacritics Diacritics especially Polish diacritics make articles much more difficult to link to it takes me about a minute to track down the proper letter and then copypaste it they interfere with proper alphabetization in category listings are visually very intimidating to many Englishspeakers cause confusion for pronounciation and do not always display correctly on all web browsers

Another posibility is Marie Leszczyńska it is significantly more popular than Maria Leszczyńska c 400 hits but Marie Leczinska is twice as popular as Marie Leszczyńska Moreover Marie Leszczyńska lacks the aforesaid benefit it contains diacritics

That being said I informally propose moving the article to Marie Leczinska
