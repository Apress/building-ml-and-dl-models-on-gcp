response to another question Re TalkHomeopathy celebrendorsments 

No we could use the fact that celebrities have been paid to promote these products to support the statement that homeopathic remedies have been advertised by celebrity endorsement However advertising and popularity are two different things  one is hoped to lead to the other by the people paying for the advertising but it isnt a necessary connection  Tim Vickers a statement that could be interprested as arguing that all of the celebrities who support homeopathic medicine have been paid by mystirious people Big Homeopathy conspiracy theories Not only that Vickers later confessed to just cynical about celebrity endorsements in advertisements essentially he admits that he believes that rush limbaugh Bill Clinton the Pope and the British Royal Family were all paid to publically endorse homeopathy Can that be right Its possible that Vickers meant something else but it cant imagine what else Later on I think any normal person assumes that if a celebrity appears in an advert then they have been paid to do so
