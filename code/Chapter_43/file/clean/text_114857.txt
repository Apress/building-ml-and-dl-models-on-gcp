Edit request on 17 January 2013 

A few days ago I made an addition to the article making a reference to the tv series Glee but was removed by another user but I believe it is a valid statement and fact and one that should be stated somewhere on the wiki article The user deleted the article leaving a summary that the reference was a poorly written article but it think that was a defensive action from sometype of an emotional attachment to the movie Pitch Perfect and the ref URL looks derogatory the user was IP address 24511571 

Here is the edit

The film also reflects many aspects of the TV series Glee including characters dialog interactions and plot developments httpwwwwetpaintcomgleearticlesfivereasonswhypitchperfectisbasicallyagleeripoff
