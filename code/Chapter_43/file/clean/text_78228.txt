It is not The Celberty Booking Tallent iswas his agent which is not valid as a independent reliable source  arlenethornton site iswas his agent so that discludes it as a reliable source  From what I can tell by looking at the first 5 credits theyre minor roles or tertiary roles  Most of the content is already contained in the Career section in prose  I would be amenable to listing those roles in a filmography section or any role where he was in the top 2 tiers of characters Anything else makes this page a IMDB dump
