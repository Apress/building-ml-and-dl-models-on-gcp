I dont get it The goalposts keep changing This is in fact very odd Its quite simple really I have requested a change in the article and provided credible sources that support my proposed change 

In that regard I have fulfilled the Wiki policy on edit requests Further this odd consesus requirement was not required the first time I made this post I was only required to quote mention the specific changes in a change X to Y format Please clarify
