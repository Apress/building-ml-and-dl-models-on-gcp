Yes I know about the two options of lL symbols

Incidentally I was interested in your suggestion that wing loading should be in force units I had never thought of it like that and it makes some sense I see that you have reverted some of your changes but it was interesting to question it In any case I think that it is redundant for aircraft articles to state a measure that is merely the ratio of two other measures already stated Most readers dont care and those that do care can calculate the ratio from the information provided Wing loading and power to weight ratio are examples in that category My main concern was to see SI units rather than kgf Thanks for the feedback   talk 1503 2 Jan 2005 UTC
