I am slowly working on many of the mountains of Washington  I do one or two a day
I have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created  One is a list of highest points in each of Washingtons 39 counties  I research if they need disambiguation  So for Big Horn mountain I had to research whether there were other things called Big Horn  there are tons of them  As you can see there are hundreds of uses of Big Horn  If I can I find newspaper articles relating to the place   But due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship I have not been able to isolate one article about Big Horn  Big Horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in Lewis County Washington  But I did find a couple of trip reports

Hi there  You may have noticed that Ive been adding to the excellent article you created here  a few extra refs and some photographs plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer  Oh and I renamed it too Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status  I havent done this before but it seems to comply with the criteria or to be nearly there anyway  What do you think   

You baked the cake I just added the icing  Fingers crossed  

 Oh dear 

This might interest you  

 Re WPHD TOTD 

I was wondering about that too Wikipedia talkTip of the day would be the appropriate place to bring this up but I dont think its very active Other than that the admins noticeboard or miscellanious Village Pump may be places to bring it up that would get a faster response  1559 18 May 2007 TC

 Penmon revisited 

Hello again  The GA review picked up various points some easy to fix some not  Anyway Ive had a go and fixing things and I think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that Ive missed particularly points 1 5 and 7  Then perhaps itll get its GA badge  

Great work  Ive renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away   

Good news I think that means that you and I are entitled to display this  as a reward for our hard work  Right wheres next

Your monobookjs looks fine and in fact it worked when I copied it to my account to test Try bypassing your cache again and see if it works now  1257 1 June 2007 TC
