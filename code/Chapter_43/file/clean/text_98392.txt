Proposing deletion of an Article 

Hi Tavix How are you doing I think I need to ask you for your help if you dont mind helping a newbie since i can see that youve had experience in editing articles and seem to be an authority on article qualification Again Im new to wikipedia and I have one purpose here to have a page for the hockey league I belong to I have read countless help articles linking to other help articles linking to more help articles  Ive read notibility articles for deletion deletion policy guidlines in my efforts to save my page from the few people who seem to want the page gone forever These people have not giving any advice just citing everything thats wrong with the page and nothing that is right  Can I change your mind on windsor floor hockey league and your proposing on deleting it  I would do whatever possible to comply with the rules of wikipedia and have read quite alot in the guidelines about why the page SHOULD be included so many i donno where to begin social  recreational clubs have a place on wiki   Included in the article is a physical address of where the games take place some article i read said that stands for something theres alot of reasons why it SHOULD exist on wikipedia and about two or three small debatable issues about lack of notibility I included all the leagues website and pages and its not like anyone is debating the truthfulness of the article but they do insist on citing the page for 1 notability 2 More independant sources   Where i have done the best i possibly can I included all the links EVER available   And having said that ask any of the 80 families that are effected by this league in a town during a time where 10 of its population has been laid off indefinitely   This league is notable to me and to others isnt that enough for you

Can you answer me this how is this league not notable to the people and families who CARE about it notibility is in the eye of the beholder Just because its not being written about in the newspapers YET  doesnt make it any less notable to the people who would type WFHL into the search

I hope to work WITH you and not against you as i try to save my page hopefully one mans reason as to why my article is not notable wont erase the many reasons why people like myself think it SHOULD be included in wikipedia Thanks for reading hopefully this will convince you to help the cause instead of adding to the fire thats trying to destroy it
