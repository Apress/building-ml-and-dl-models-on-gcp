I agree and have trimmed the article back considerably  I do appreciate the amount of work that went into gathering the information here but I must insist that Wikipedia is not the place for this kind of datagathering If someone wants to collate the charts and timelines of this term a better place is on a personal website or blog not on a Wikipedia page   Wikipedia should only be used to summarize data after it has been published in major reliable sources such as books and newspapers   It should not be used to aggregate information from campaign websites and it should especially not be used to try and make a case that a term was coined on such and such a date when the only source is someones blog  Please lets keep the article pared down to RS information only onka
