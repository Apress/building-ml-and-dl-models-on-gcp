Well then there is one item I have to wait to talk about cause it is about the ending I was impressed with the little physical traits of ThawMorse that Shaun Evans gave us The tug of the collar etc I also liked the fleshing out of some of the things in Morses past that the original series had referred to over the years I also like that we saw a young version of Max the pathologist as Peter Woodthorpe and John Thaws interplay was a delight of the first three seasons of Morse One question  If this is going to be the only Endeavor episode shouldnt the page be moved to take series out of its title

As much as PBS is a a part of my life I tired several years ago of how they mess with the British programs So I bought myself a region free DVD player and have been ordering the series from Amazon UK Amazingly the product is often cheaper  even with the shipping costs  than buying the DVDs from Amazon US and I get to see the programs before they air on PBS or BBC America  or as I know call it the Top GearGordan Ramsey channel Sherlock has been brilliant and I love the jokes about Mycrofts weight Speaking of Mark Gatiss who would have thought that one of The League of Gentleman zanies would be doing so many interesting things today That also means that I should mention his one time colleague Steve Pembertons WhiteChapel series While not necessarily up there with some of our favorites it has had some interesting moments Enjoy the rest of your weekend   Talk
