While its true that she has been spouting off quite unacceptably in the AfDs for The UKA Press and Eleanor Leonne Bennett more than one editor including me has called her on it and no one takes her accusations seriously Unfortunately it often goes with the territory when COI editors find their articles up for deletion Ive been on the receiving end more than once eg   Sometimes its best just to give a brief rebuttal reiterate that personal attacks are not acceptable and leave it at that Lengthy responses tend to encourage yet more vitriol from them Her editing of your user drafts is also unacceptable and Ill also have a word with her about it Im not an admin but it might help
