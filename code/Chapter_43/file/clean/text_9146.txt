Reviewer   

which at around 0630 local time on 22 May 2010  You should note which time zone it is referring to when it says local time or better yet just put the time in UTC 
Some references are in the wrong places because it looks like some statements are unsourced This is the situation in the following statements
Initial reports from survivors suggested a tyre burst6 as the aircraft attempted a goaround  Move reference 6 to the end of the sentence
800 feet 240 m54 well before the aircraft made a touch down  Move reference 54 to the end of the sentence 
and also of the alleged hostile attitude of the airlines counsel80 Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India DYFI along with Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airlines office in Mangalore where they submitted a memorandum to officials demanding that families of the victims receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera  Either the reference 80 is in the wrong place or this statement really is unsourced
The units of measure are inconsistent as to whether it is American first or metric first eg 2000 feet 610 m and 90 metres 300 ft they should be American first and metric last or vice versa but not both
