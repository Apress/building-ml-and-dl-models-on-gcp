Stephan may I borrow this comment and sprinkle it on my lawn to help it grow Really I have watched this topic area for years and BLPs of skeptics are absolutely littered with opinions like this Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted and hes not even a scientist Editors like you have either ignored the use of such opinions as sources or outright endorsed it because the opinions supported your POV Now we have similar opinions from a respected climatologist published in the Wall Street Journal and all of a sudden its a primary source Please Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes examining the histories can see the blatant hypocrisy of your position In fact on BLPN right now there is a debate about Michaels criticism started by none other than ChrisO  this is the same editor who has in the last week editwarred to include nonnotable and weaklysourced criticism in Chris Moncktons BLP The hypocrisy of the editors here is absolutely astounding and I will be shocked if arbcom doesnt deal with it   2026
