I think comfort with the term gene vs protein I agree molecule isnt good depends on what biological specialty you were trained in  In genomics we are more likely to talk about the function of genes not the proteins  But to be a bit more philosophical although the protein actually does all the good stuff I think the word gene encompasses more of the lifespan of this unit of heredity than does the word protein  And I definitely dont want to see separate articles for genes and proteins
