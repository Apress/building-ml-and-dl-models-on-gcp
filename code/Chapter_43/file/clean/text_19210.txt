Singles sections 

Hi I noticed you have been adding Singles sections to album articles It may be better not to do this because the article is likely to mention the singles elsewhere  for example you recently added a Singles section to the Music of the Sun article which already stated Music of the Sun includes the singles Pon de Replay If Its Lovin That You Want and Let Me Another reason not to do this is that prose should be used instead of lists wherever possible

Also please remember to cite reliable verifiable sources for your edits particularly those involving the addition and changing of information about future events eg forthcoming single releases Thanks
