Im confused here too  So far Ive only added one new source today  so I dont know what that means  I guess Im confused about the new info doesnt concern mens rights  If men are less likely to have to pay alimony in Nordic countries because its assumed that divorced spouses dont need to care for one another  but theres a high rate of longstanding legal separations in Italy and Latin American countries so that women continue to be supported and retain inheritance rights how is that not related to mens rights  

I think were back again to getting a problem statement rolling  with definition of what is meant by mens rights to help guide me and others it would be so great to have help fix this article  I put in the mens rights definitions as a starting point and hoped for refinement by others
