But here it is as someone who went to school in Silverdale I have no idea where this Maple Falls is that theyre talking about maybe on Silver Creek at the far east end of Silverdale Road I dont know this seems to be Genstars rebranding of Silverhill which the Silverhilldale community fought hard against ie wiping the name of Silverhill off the map its Silverdales twin community and shares the same family rootsconnections  

theres further citation about he Silverdale CPR stop being on a register of heritage places I was surprised to see that cat removed but readded it with heritage refs that were easy to find the dispute on the netlibrarynet bio that there is no proof the Silverdale robbery was not his doing Ive never seen before
