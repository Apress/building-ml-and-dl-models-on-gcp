Nonsense The Syrian army committed 1500 men They were wholly unprepared for the war having received notice that they were to fight just a few days before the 15th of May Their logistics were poor  they had handed over a part of their munition reserves to the Arab Salvation Army and given its scarcity of war mat√©riel had to husband what was left Its knowledge of the theatre of war where it was to conduct operations was minimal It took then almost a week to get their tanks over the Jordan Their first advance was roundly defeated with heavy losses On the 18th under Husni Zaim they attacked and took Samakh south of Tiberias only to lose it in three days after an Israelikibbutznik counter attack This massive army with artillary tanks armedarmoured cars and airforce stocked with Harvards not Harvardarmed aircraft which is a brilliantly comical image took 4 days involving almost all that the Syrian army could muster to capture a little  moshava like Mishmar HaYarden with its 20 local guards Tal p261 which had to fight on its own without IDF assistance
