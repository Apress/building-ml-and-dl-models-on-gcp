All of my points go to arguing about the validity of sources and claims My responses follow
 It is not clear to me in any way how this 3866 reduction is calculated Can you please clarify
 According to the definition of Randomised Controlled Trial the RCTs here do not qualify I have provided numerous reliable secondary sources showing why this is true
 Please show me how my claims about statistical insignificance are incorrect Wikipedia states that news sources are OK It is not up to you to say that the source is not reliable Wikipedias policies dictate that If you can say that the bogus RCTs and metastudies are reliable then the news sources are in too You cant have your cake and eat it too
 Please go back and read my bullet points I never mentioned that the eletters were a source My words were see citations

All I see here are straw man arguments Please justify your claims with sources I have provided numerous sources above
