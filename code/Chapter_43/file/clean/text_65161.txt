The point I was making is that there seemed to be a level of contradiction with Molitor he was primarily an infielder with the Brewers He became a hall of fame DH with the Twins Either way weve all passed 4th grade math I assume and know what sets and subsets are Left fielders are outfielders but not all outfielders are left fielders I believe that Rickey played enough center that the correct title for him would be Outfielder Id like to also point out that I started a similar debate on Babe Ruths site and Outfielder seems to be the the concensus there
