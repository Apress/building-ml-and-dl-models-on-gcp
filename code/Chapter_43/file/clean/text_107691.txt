Batvette first things first Im not the least bit sure that the USAFs Air Force Historical Studies Office which is headquartered at the Pentagon meets the criteria for WPNPOV Indeed I suggest that it is very appropriate to use caution regarding any weight attributed to the USAFs analysis of actions performed by the USAF see WPConflict of Interest Especially as it regards to such controversial operations the USAF investigating the actions of the USAF are akin to the police investigating the conduct of police officers  heavy bias is inevitable Further more it may be argued that such a source violates WPPrimary Source
Batvette the air force historical societysic analysis of Dresden firebombing that you have provided places some emphasis on the military value of Dresden as a target for strategic bombing It refers to Dresdens value as a transport and communications hub see para II It also refers to specific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot see para II10 Perversely one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden was protected by antiaircraft defenses antiaircraft guns and searchlights see para 11 Im not at all sure what to make of that bizarre reference

The historian Alexander McKee has cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in 1953 USAAF report and point out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of town and not in fact targeted during the raidMcKee 1983 p 6162 The hutted camps mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were provided for refugees It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps nor were the bridges such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe RiverMcKee 1982 pp6263 Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that The standard whitewash gambit both British and American is to mention that Dresden contained targets X Y and Z and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus except for one or two mere accidents they escapedMcKee 1983 p61 McKee further asserts The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets which was just as well for they knew very little about Dresden the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn and that Dresden possessed in full measureMcKee 1983 p63

According to historian Sonke Neitzel it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in Germany industry at this stage in the warAddison 2006 Chapter The City under Attack by Sonke Neitzel p76 Wing Commander H R Allen said The final phase of Bomber Commands operations was far and away the worst Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years henceMcKee 1983 p 315 Quotes H R Allen 1972 The Legacy of Lord Trenchard

In the north of Dresden there were remarkable military facilities which were not hit by the bombings Today they are still there used as officer education buildings for the German Bundeswehr and hosting Germanys militaryhistoric museum from stoneage to modern times

Batvette the above comments come from WPRS that are significantly more NPOV than the USAFs Air Force Historical Studies Office
Regardless claiming that US culpability for its involvement in the Dresden firebombing was mitigated because it focused its bombing on the Marshalling Yards is a bit like the arsonist claiming that shes innocent of murder because she only intended to set fire to the relativelyu
