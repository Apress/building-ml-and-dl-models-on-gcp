As long as the pronunciations are linked to symbol keys then a mix would be fine The intent is to add a very simple alternative to IPA Many webpages or books use the respelled pronunciations with just the plain letters so that form is easy to verify and add into articles Also there could be added American or local pronunciations such as
 Halleys Comet pr UK Hauleze American Haleze will return in 2062
 Lafayette LA pr Laugheeett is in southcentral Lousiana
 Cape Cod pr Cahd local Kwod is in eastern Massachusetts
 When a pronunciation has several variations then the whole explanation can be placed into a footnote listing each spoken form Wikid77
