Thanks The thing is that I was born in 1984 in Latvia as well I have also lived in London UK where I was registered as born in Latvia This is because Latvian SSR was just playing a country on the political stage it was not a real country Latvian SSR was part of the Soviet Union as a country founded by the Soviets But this country didnt have any territory or people or any legitimate right to exist The territory and people since 1918 uninterruptedly have belonged to the Republic of Latvia which has never been part of the Soviet Union 15914887183
