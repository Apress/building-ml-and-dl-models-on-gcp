A big thank you
Hello Jeandr√© I just wanted to say a big thank you for the note on my page about being able to preview categories at the bottom of the page I dont believe that I have ever scrolled down that far when editing and while it isnt the most important thing in the world I do try to have my edits in order before saving so I use the show preview button a lot I appreciate the time that you took to let me know about this and thanks again    Talk
