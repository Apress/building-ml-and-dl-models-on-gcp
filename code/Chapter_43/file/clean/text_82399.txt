Yeah this is pretty much how I see you I can tell the difference between an editor or admin out to get me a few are on occasion maybe and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment Often what I do can be hard to understand if Im brief its rejected as incoherent if I explain thoroughly its tldr And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often timeconsuming that is the best of writing and its hard to come by One of my friends who in the past has written on the same topics as I do but who is far more brief has said that sure hes brief but Im more thorough and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary which Id say is typically excellent as it takes me to write my tome Ideally it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia writers often are too wordy besides having points of view making mistakes and failing to reference claims because they are writing from personal knowledge and thats why they need editors in real life as well as on Wikipedia Editors and writers realworld are famous for conflict
Online interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly highbandwidth communication in person mostly visual this cant be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text not even close much more than a thousand times as much information per second Ive been conferencing online since the mid1980s and it was obvious then If there is rapport failure text may be interpreted through a hostile filter hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings Woonpton has done some reading in my history and doesnt understand what she read I think its she Others have done the same If you look at Jehochmans warning to me that was the basis for my block last year you could see a similarity with Woonptons conclusions Iridescent didnt make that the basis of the block but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman first with a userspace selfRfC an new process I must say that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated it was designed to be minimally disruptive had I been as accused Id have been so advised and I would not have been able to use the selfRfC for anything else then by approaching Jehochman directly and out of that a very solid working relationship has been formed it was good even before we met in person I never did address it with Iridescent it seemed moot by the time Id have been ready Maybe someday Thanks for dropping by make yourself at home Watch out for the pet dogvomit slime mold in the corner and please step over the clutter Coffee or tea
