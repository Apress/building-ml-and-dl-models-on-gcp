 Please dont change the format of dates as you did to Marion Raven As a general rule if an article has evolved using predominantly one format the dates should be left in the format they were originally written in unless there are reasons for changing it based on strong national ties to the topic Please also note that Wikipedia does not use ordinal suffixes eg st nd th articles or leading zeros on dates

For more information about how dates should be written on Wikipedia please see this article

If you have any questions about this ask me on my talk page or place helpme on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions Enjoy your time on Wikipedia Thank you
