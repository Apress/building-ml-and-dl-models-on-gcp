When the other editors appear to have a military minded agenda to remove UFO information and supporting related documents i dont think it is bad for me to point this out and request these users identify themselves or their military roles so that we can assertain their true agenda which does not appear to have the interests of Wiki at heart but personal agendas My points stand YOurself and ALR are trying to delete information on UFOs not because you either dont like UFOs or have a vested interest in keeping this information off RAF pages where ity has been factually established it rightfully belongs So by continuing to argue and delete wiki information it has understandably degenerated into questions being asked of your motives
