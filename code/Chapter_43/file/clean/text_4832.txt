There are many inaccurate statements being posted here Far too many i dont have time to correct all of them The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were proimperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that Another example The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs yet now they support druguse and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession trade and cultivation of cannabis So they went from being antidrug to prodrug The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial Secondly the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by antiBNPers What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents children and woman as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil i presume was a comical claim It has no basis in fact BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF Unite against Freedom who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc Is that democratic You might not like someone elses political views but that doesnt give you a right to go out and attack them violently
