Well your justified by wanting Kliridis in government because of Annan plan As you said this Annan plan is a headache for Greeks actually a small minority of greeks who trust the murderers of iraq thats right you want it to be finish in whatever solution that will be under Turkey interest and you dont care if it will destroy cyprus and our future generation Sorry my friend but we have the so called Koumbarokratia which cares for the survival of any solution but not to solution that will destroy cyprus because koumbarokratia for you is to not satisfy the murderers of iraq to reject to sale your homeland to turkey to defend human rights etc and also to accept 2 seperate states with a weak government which would not have work So if you call this koumbarokratia then yes we are proud to have a president of koumbarokratia cyprus would have been only on papers in EU the solution would have been antiEuropean because the plan was violating extremely the main issues of the european law and also cyprus would have no vote since we would have to wait the court to take decision i say this believing that u have read annan plan and put it to your mind because u said majority wanted annan plan and changed mind Cypriots are not idiots and have pride and WOULD HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED A PLAN OF THE SHAPE the status quo would have been legal under this planUserKRBN
