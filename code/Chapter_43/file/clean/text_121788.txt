Hi Malaka

Im new to Wikipedia greekCanadian and have noticed a strong antiGreek bias on several articles related to Macedonia Ive been having issues with both Furper and Beam who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM Ive officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia  specifically Balkanfever 

httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaAdministrators27_noticeboardThis_anon_28apparently_UserCrossthets292C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher2C_evidence_below

This is a difficult battle because I am alone at the moment I am a newbie and as I said to one of the admins on notice board I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policemans ball  However I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as nonNPOV behavior I noticed while researching this issue youve also have problems with them Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone Furthermore since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if theyve also had problems with those two and if so add those incidents to your list  and perhaps get them to contact others 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously I will check back here in a couple of days Have courage Regards 20916123886
