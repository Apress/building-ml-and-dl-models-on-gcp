your last edit on false accusations of rape 

would you consider undoing it  The Australia study as it stands places undue weight on its false classification  The procedures may very well be simply those who it threatened to file charges against  The greater context of withdrawn and not pursued is not irrelevant  It clarifies the uncertainty of these classifications

Regarding your Rumney edit it was clear that it was Rumney quoting Stewart  In your previous edit you placed undue weight on criticism of Stewart by selectively quoting one of his findings

thank you
