Hello James Cantor

Thank you so much for your comments The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate I just find is unusual that Crusios page is so much larger than those who are far more notable I think Crusios page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate I can not but wonder how Wim Crusios page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine As a scientist one tends to plot data on a graph and if you where to do so Crusios data point would be considered an out lier As I stated the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years I think that gives us good yard stick and says something about how much information a scientists site should have While I agree with you that more good material is better it appears that hundreds of wiki users disagree with this statement based upon the data
