Thank you for showing interest in editing ancient history pages we truely need a lot of effort to shape up this site however wikipedia policy has established that both BC and BCE are equally legitimate dating conventions and it is not permitted to change dating systems from one to the other en masse I know opinions are strong on this issue however this is the policy which has been hammered out over the years and is not likely to change soon
