Open University

Ive added a couple of user templates at

CategoryWikipedians_by_alma_mater_Open_University

would you have a look at them its probably easier to get the rough edges taken off them when the number of users is still small People tend to get a bit miffed if you alter the boxes after they have been put on their pages
