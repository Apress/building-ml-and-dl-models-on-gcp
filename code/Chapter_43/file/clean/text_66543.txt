Will hurd bio 

I have posted a biography of Will Hurd The reason it was nominated for speedy deletion states that the article is about the person himself and not his accomplishements However the majority of the article talks about his involvement in the Bonfire at Texans AM University and his courageous work with counterrorism etc which are all properly cited from newspaper articles and publications

I understand the rules for biographies are more regulated than any other type of article but I believe this article steadily meets the criteria of a notable person mentioned in the news newspapers and on the internet 

I motion to keep this article

Thank you
