GREAT   THANK YOU   I really do appreciate the information you supplied above  You have given me an
answer to a matter I was confused about  So my next question is since Jennifer ONeill is very famous for that movie can I use that same movie poster image pic for her wikipage I contributed to Please explain Thanks Also in a good faith attempt to comply with policy I uploaded a pic of her at a public speaking engagement in Washington DC at a prochoice rally taken of her in public but I do not know who the photographer was but that was deleted too making me confused and somewhat exasperated maybe being a 1st timer and new   thanks for your time  see I am not a child
