Just saw your Olive Branch

Hi 

I only saw your olive branch near the end of may last posting session I had to go so had no time to respond I wanted to say that I appreciated it and if I had more time I would have offered you an Olive Branch back 

Since I was under time pressure I decided to withdraw my comment about Wikipedia policy versus thinking independently because I was concerned that my wording might have been getting too heated 

I withdrew another comment about Overmedication to avoid misunderstanding as it never had anything to do with you at all or any other person posting on Dr Daniel Amen related pages but I was concerned that it might be taken that way Thanks
