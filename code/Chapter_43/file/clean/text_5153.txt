 Summary of Consequences 

I believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events and in a summary article one must summarize the consequences My edit stating that as a result of the FrancoBritish action on Czechoslovakia the MolotovRibbentrop Pact was signed is a factual statement This is not Stalins arguments this is not a Soviet Apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event In the Spanish Civil War the Red Army fought side by side with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Prior to the FrancoBritish assisted Nazi Sudetenland Grab relations between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union were icy When the Nazis were declaring war on Czechoslovakia the USSR was hard at work putting together an antiNazi coalition Only after seeing the British and French backed down in the face of naked antiSlavic aggression did the Soviets begin to look for other allies There is no mass conspiracy here as the search began right after the event This is not a motive its a statement of facts If there are no more objections I will reinsert the statement into the article as it is merely cause and effect   
Respectfully disagree The statement as a result of the FrancoBritish action on Czechoslovakia the MolotovRibbentrop Pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage although in actuality the linkage was not so obvious and the scholars opinion on that vary dramatically One school thinks that the only and sincere Soviet Unions desire was to establish a collective security system and an antiHitlers coalition Another school believes that the only Stalins aim was the alliance with Hitler The third version the most reasonable in my opinion is that the USSR was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most European powers that was at least partially justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against Germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers and to expand its territory The statement you tried to introduce into the article is a POV of the leftist part of the first group scholars We cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events We have either to tell a full story that is impossible because of space limitations or to abstain from any interpretationsInterestingly your statement may be even simply incorrect because according to my sources Hitlers occupation of Czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the USSR UK and France and could lead to signing of AntiHitler triple alliance In only a month after occupation of Czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks Had Chamberlain and Stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other and had Ribbentrop been little bit less active WWII could be preventedRe This is not a motive its a statement of facts No All these facts had already been in the article before your edits Your wording looks like a description of motives not statement of factsIf you still disagree try to propose another wording that takes into account all what I wrote In addition a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article Try to follow this unwritten rule That saves a lot of time and efforts  
As there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of World War II and Wikipedias guidelines require that all nonfringe views be given equal weight it isnt feasible for this highlevel article to discuss casual links between events   
What Nick said also the USSR wanting to be neutral argument falls apart because historical evidence clearly shows that had France honored its alliance with Czechoslovakia USSR would have intervened as well USSR secured a passage from Romania in order to assist Czechoslovakia USSR placed all of its divisions west of the Urals on High Alert After the seizure of Czechoslovakia the USSR held the UK partially responsible and frankly did not trust them or the French as allies If France failed to uphold their defensive treaty with Czechoslovakia why would a defensive treaty with USSR
