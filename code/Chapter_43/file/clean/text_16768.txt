yo i found the charts pic httpenwikipediaorgwikiImageEuropean_population_substructurepng

seems it was deleted by some Spanish guy httpenwikipediaorgwikiSpecialContributions6213631118 who was somehow offended by the results i cant tell exactly in what way but i think by the notsointense bonding of Spanish genes in the rest of the SouthEuropean gene structure which is not a big deal Spanish people still belong to the southEuropean genes

anyway i also found that the research was indeed valid For more info here httpwwwplosgeneticsorgarticleinfodoi101371journalpgen0020143
The analysis was performed using 749 single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs informative for European substructure selected from a genomewide panel of more than 5700 SNPs 749 polymorphisms are more than the triple polymorphisms needed to make a valid human genes research Note that there have been politicalracist propagandistic researches that have used 1 polymorphism 1 as opposed to 749 Usually 200300 Polymorphisms used Conclusively I see no point in not including this httpenwikipediaorgwikiImageEuropean_population_substructurepng pic in the European population substructure paragraph httpenwikipediaorgwikiGenetic_history_of_EuropeEuropean_population_substructure 

is anybody against my thoughts
