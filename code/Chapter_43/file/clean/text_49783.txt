I had just typed out a smashing long post then accidentally closed my browser tabso I will save the civility protests and long explanations for another day  Your proposed addition is mostly okay and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word terrorist is applied to the organization  I would add the FBI website and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the FBIs terrorism task force watch list  There are plenty of categories too many probably available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article  CategoryTerrorism in America is one of them the one you just added CategoryOrganizations designated as terrorist by the US government is another  There is a huge BLP concern with branding living ex members as terrorists particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge  But again this can all be handled by being cautious about what is said and how it is said  Why dont I give this a quick edit tomorrow here on the talk page and if neither you nor others object Ill throw in my approval and well add the new subsection to the article page  Thats okay by me as long as its kept neutral and neither the category nor the text authoritative give Wikipedias endorsement that they are terrorists just that people have called them that  Ciao
