Octagon business
I have added a prod template to the article Octagon business suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process All contributions are appreciated but I dont believe it satisfies Wikipedias criteria for inclusion and Ive explained why in the deletion notice see also What Wikipedia is not and Wikipedias deletion policy  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the dated prod notice but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page Also please consider improving the article to address the issues raised Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria or it can be sent to Articles for Deletion where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached onka
