2010 team roster 

Moved from User talkKevin McE

Hi there I wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited WPCRYSTAL Im not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate Thanks   

I dont know what needs to be explained  We cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year because we do not know the future  An encyclopaedia reports facts not expectations    

Hi again Firstly I moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow I am still not clear exactly what at WPCRYSTAL makes this content inappropriate This is not a predicted team roster it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim   

It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that  A 2010 roster not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject but that is a different matter is not something that exists in 2009 and even as a speculative list it is so incomplete as to be meaningless it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles but these are not the point  Returning to the Crystal balling issue you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact  Lets hope it doesnt happen but Sky might go bust or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury before 1 January in which case 2010 will arrive they will not be part of the team and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error  Facts not expectation    

I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesnt mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist However all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010 that makes them part of the squad for 2010 Were not simply expecting them to be they are confirmed to be Surely though we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen I think you are misinterpreting WPCRYSTAL Id suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable as is the case here If it turns out that any or all of these riders dont ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article wont have been guilty of having recorded an error because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available   

Im not saying that it wont happen nor that it is not very likely but that it is expectation not fact  You speak of verifiability but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable  If they were to die before the end of this year they will not be in the 2010 team the future is not confirmed  An entirely accurate description of something that does not currently exist is not possible and as a description a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate   

I find your position on this matter a little strange You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such We can and should only base the article on what can be verified at the current time and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010 The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is and should only ever be based upon information available at the time I would note that not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here but also that a further ten names have been announced
