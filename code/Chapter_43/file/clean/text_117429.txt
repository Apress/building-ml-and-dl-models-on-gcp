Like I said I thought you had quit and had a pathetic hissy fit In fact you did In fact take some advice free of charge Next time you throw a hissy fit and flounce of in a petulant childish huff try going for longer than a couple of days It just looks so unseemly otherwise Like it was an ego trip to get a few people to say dont leave we need you and massage an otherwise fragile ego Also suggest you read the link you referred to yourself as it does seem rather fitting for you
