As I explained in my edit summary the layout has to look right in all screen modes There is simply too little text for your layout to work in 800x600  you probably have been viewing on a flatscreen monitor In 800x600 there is a thin column of text that meets your delicate and tactful description of a visually ugly mess I have now restructured the layout in a way that looks fine in all modes and I hope will meet approval with your discerning eye
