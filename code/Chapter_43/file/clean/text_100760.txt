 Your edits to The Red Badge of Courage 

Thank you for your comments at the PR  I would appreciate it however if you refrained from copyediting perhaps you could comment instead  There are several mistakes in this edit alone which is somewhat unhelpful seeing as how I have to now copyedit your copyedits   Thanks  habla conmigo 
Sure   
Sadads thanks for the cupcake my second in one day  I feel the need to point out however that the comment I made on Truthkeepers talk page was in no way aimed at you and in fact did not even mention you  That you think that comment had anything to do with you saddens me  No I do not feel that your suggestions at the PR are entirely helpful as far as what I intend for the article but my comment re the Novels WikiProject dealt entirely with what I saw on the talk page after I had posted my request for reviews  Its not the same project with the same focus that I remember which is why I ended up removing my post  Again this had nothing to do with you or your curriculum vitae  Since we are now discussing it however Im sure you do a very good job in most of your Wiki endeavors  Please do be careful in reviewing potential FACs however despite the obvious need for reviewers at GACPRFAC I know that I personally would rather have one very good knowledgeable reviewer than several who may not be as good andor knowledgeable  That is where my frustration stemmed from and now I know where yours did as well  Thanks  habla conmigo 
Sigh  my page seems to be causing too much drama these days so Ill bring this here First re the grammar Ill address that on the talk page If it would help Im more than happy to send Sage and Awadewit  email  giving them permission to divulge to you their impression of whether I am qualified a to make judgement regarding literature and b to have a sense of what or what not academics here need or want Would that be helpful at all  The Red Badge of Courage is of high importance in the canon of Am lit and needs to be done right I was quite careful in the GA review before passing it There is perhaps room for development regarding themes but whats there is presented succinctly and is easy to read Quite honestly Im tempted to take the monstrosity Ive created with The Sun Also Rises and simplify following the example of Red Badge Anyway thanks for the pie  I even have a chair on my page so I can sit and eat pie and fight with the ANI crowd    

Hey no fair  Truthkeeper got a pie and I only got a lousy cupcake   Seriously though and this goes to both Sadads and Truthkeeper thank you both for your input on Red Badge  The problem with such important  and quite frankly brilliant  novels like Red Badge and The Sun Also Rises is trying to strike that perfect balance between readability and encyclopedic value  Its so difficult to get just right and as a result no two novelrelated articles are ever the same  Perhaps thats why a project like WPNOVELS will never be sustainable in quite the same way as WikiProjects dedicated to battleships films or even fungi  A few years ago when I tried to resurrect the project it was unfortunately a waste of time for me personally while my interests even then were leaning toward classic literature it seemed that many members were only occupied with popular literature  We could never seem to organize ourselves and it seems that continues today  That and I admittedly seem to work better by myself  I apologize for my shortness with you I know you meant well but my high standards clouded that fact  Im sorry if this episode may have hastened a wikibreak on your part  I hope it doesnt keep you away from long since its obvious you have your fingers in many Wikipies and you obviously enjoy what you do  Y
