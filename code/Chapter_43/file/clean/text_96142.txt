I do not know anything about Turkish communities in Germany but if categories about one country are not categorized accurately it doesnt mean that same should be done with categories of other countries Also if you warn me about revert warring why you behave like this by yourself You are obviously disruptive user I now included all villages with Hungarian majority in your category and I see no reason to include any other settlement there Moreover most settlements of Vojvodina are populated by many ethnic groups which make even more misleading to describe such settlements as exclusively Hungarian communities Please stop your revert warring and disruptive behavior 7710557115
