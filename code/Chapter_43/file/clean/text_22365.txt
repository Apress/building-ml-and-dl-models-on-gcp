James River crossings
I added in the two missing bridge articles in the Richmond area which should allow your navbox to get west through the VA288 bridge Beginning with the new article for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge the others in order east to west are 

I95 bridge at Richmond part of the former RichmondPetersburg Turnpike
Mayo Bridge US Route 360
Manchester Bridge US Route 60
Robert E Lee Memorial Bridge US Route 1US Route 301
Boulevard Bridge State Route 161 toll and major weight restrictrions
Powhite Parkway Bridge State Route 76 toll
Huguenot Memorial Bridge State Route 147
Edward E Willey Bridge State Route 150
