80011691200
New subheadingUpon a reminder from Fergananim on this question as raised by him and enthusiastically supported by Scolaire I said Id elaborate a bit here Looking though the discussion again I see I have already tried to say something about it Anyway I think we should follow the now established historiographical division of of 8001169 To amend problems the limitations from such a division Im thinking the we should to the following
Add a couple of sentences either in the lead or in the historiography section explaining why this division is somewhat problematic Mind any division that gets established is problematic for the same reasons
Have a solid backgroundsection to draw the lines from before 800 into our period Ive slready started that but it might be expanded
Have a solid whatevertheoppositeofbackgroundiscalledinEnglishsection drawing lines from our period into the future so to speak
Dont treat 1169 as limit written in stone despite being in the title The second synod of Cashel should be discussed here despite being in 1172 the career of Rory OConnor after the invasion should be included etc etc
Its not like Im married to 1169 though but maybe we could wait drawing a conclusion on this until Ive gotten around to write something except church history about Ireland after 1050 Might be easier for you to understand my thinking and argue against it  if its in the article and not just in my head Best regards
