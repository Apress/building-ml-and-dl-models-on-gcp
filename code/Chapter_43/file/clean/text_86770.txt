Plot details and minor characters
I imagine my edits will probably be reverted several times so I may as well start this in case Character articles describe characters but they are not meant to hold every single plot detail relevant to the characters Entries should have a basic description background information if it is necessary and plot details only if they deal with character development Something like Doyles development is fine to list while random graphic novel appearances are unnecessary Character lists also only deal with important characters Minor characters are covered within plot summaries and if people want to know more Wikia exists for that reason
