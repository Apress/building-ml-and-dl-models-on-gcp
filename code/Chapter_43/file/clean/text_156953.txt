Quagga 
Hi i see that youre changing categories at the Quagga article It might be more correct to add Extinct mammals of Africa instead of Extinct animals of Africa but Extinct mammals of Africa is a nonexistent category I would suggest to either create that category or leave it in the extinct animals category
