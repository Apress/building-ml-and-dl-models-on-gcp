Hi  two or more stub types which you created have been nominated for deletion or renaming at WikipediaStub types for deletion The stub types templates or categories which were not proposed at WikipediaWikiProject Stub sortingProposals do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type either through being incorrectly named ambiguously scoped or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size as explained at WikipediaStub Please feel free to make any comments at WPSFD regarding these stub types and in future please consider proposing new stub types first

It is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential editwarring something which has far more farreaching effects on templates than it has on articles Thus for example there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus since it is only recognised by one country If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them Until then it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types wha
