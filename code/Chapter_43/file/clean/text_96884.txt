I just cleared another one of your illinformed edits on the Dharmic Religion page AhemUniversity education did you say  So is your University the University of jaundiced worldview or the University of fertile imagination  And also which planet is this University in  You see I edit pages on strong knowledge and not feeling You edit pages on strong concoction 1111 that you have gained by merely reading books and some more books maybe this explains the dogged insistence on sources every time when often there are none and unfortunately nothing can be done about it What is more appalling is that you rate your concocted edits to be more reliable or correct than some residents of India
