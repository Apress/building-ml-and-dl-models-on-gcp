Naji alAli 

Hi Ian

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938 What is your source for that Im wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article which this page started as a translation from cites his year of birth as 1937 while a book I have about him  the one referenced in the article  cites it as 1936 What the book says in a footnote on the subject is Sulaiman alShaikh  The caricature artist Naji alAli  in the Kuwaiti magazine alArabi no 297 August 1983 Naji alAli saw this date and did not raise any objection While the book is certainly not academic its also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid alAli the artists son

On the other hand on this page Naji alAli himself is quoted as saying I was born where Christ was born between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of alShahra in the northern Galilee and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to Ain alHilwe camp in Lebanon

However the same site also bases its short biography of Naji alAli on the book I used and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly

Unless you have a solid source I think we may have to leave it as unknown

By the way that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination I wonder could we get permission to use it 

All the best   Talk
