True Ive been offtopic But I insist that by logic protestors who perceive China as a dictatorship is not the equlivalent or represent antidictatorial protestors Ive never even heard of such a thing  sounds more like political framing Would those who protest the perceived dictatorship in Saudi Arabia go on to protest against China Rarely Antidictatorial is not a single classification  it should not even be a classification in my opinion I would suggest a more lengthy wording  eg supporters who call for more individual freedom in China
