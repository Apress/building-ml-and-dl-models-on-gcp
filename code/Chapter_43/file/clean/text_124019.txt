Yes this song mentions the famine but it isnt actually about the famine the media hype thing up to no end even the name Famine song was coined by the media not by Rangers or Celtic fans In reality it is sung mocking the Celtic fans and their proIrish chants where they sing of Ireland as home The only reference to the famine is the question that if Celtic fans love Ireland so much and constantly sing of going back home why dont they The famine would be one such reason but as that is over there is now nothing stopping them It is not a demand to go home merely a mocking suggestion I am not a Celtic or Rangers fan myself but would just like to set the record straight on this I added it to the main article but it kept getting reverted disgruntled attentionseeking Celtic fans no doubt Hopefully people will read this and see the truth Thanks
