New photos 
There has been a concern regarding the photos  and from several photographers We also have not been able to determine if all the photos are from Flickr and could be from other sources Due to these facts we are inclined to believe that he has obtained these images illegally and have removed them from Wikipedia articles as per WPCOPYRIGHT Until we have confirmation that such permission to use these photos under a Common license has been granted by each photographer we will continue to remove the images Attempts have been made to contact Guyfrombronx and it appears they have been unsuccessful talk 
Hi first comment on wiki so hopefully this works  Can someone put a better picture of City Hall and Nathan Phillips square up  That photo is atrocious  It almost makes me think that whoever put it up hates the square as some do and wants to show its ugly concrete side which is does have to some degree  However on any given day there are usually a lot of people in the square either skating in the winter or at some sort of exhibition in the summer where there are also leaves on the trees making the concrete seem a bit less onerous  Ill try to get around to taking a pic but I lost my camera recently so in the meantime if anyone has one please do swap them  Thx
