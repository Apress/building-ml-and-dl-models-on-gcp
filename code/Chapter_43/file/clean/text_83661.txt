help me

This is my first attempt to work in the Wikipedia environment Im not trying to promote I was just giving a standard professional bio

Can you help me by telling me which parts are not acceptable My subsequent intent is specifically to add a new piece about the Business Rules Group standards work to Wikipedia not a commercial group and participate in editing material associated with its work  business rules Business Motivation Model SBVR etc etc It would seem like professional background would help establish credibility  but I am definitely not familiar with your mode of operation

Thx
