Apologies Masem I wasnt clear and I agree  we will likely never be able to attribute cause to Aspergers or SID  His illness had probably gone to some form of undiagnosed psychosis which nobody has stated in RS so we cant use but it takes a very serious break to do something like this  Overall Aspergers and SID are part of his mental health profile have been mentioned in RS and that is entirely relevant that we include as part of his overall profile
