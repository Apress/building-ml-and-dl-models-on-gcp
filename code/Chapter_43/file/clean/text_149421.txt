19 minutes is inordinately fast You could not have read investigated and digested this entire incident in that time you could barely have even read all the diffs and the request even once properly even if we stretch good faith by assuming you saw the request instantly and that you would know the precise wordings of WPSOCK and WPHARASS off by heart so as not to need to refer back to them You can continue to make vague assertions that Im violating the spirit of WPSOCK all you want it is what it is its you just sayin Nothing more than that You can carry on ignoring my very simple questions about your  ErrantXs statements here carry on being sarcastic and insulting to me its no skin off my nose you arent stopping me doing anything on Wikipedia by playing out this farce But Im considering a third request if only for my own satisfaction that this sort of disrespectful evasive and sarcastic treatment isnt now standard practice among all admins Hopefully I can find an admin who appreciates the very simple basic expectations that the community puts upon them If you find long posts hard to read and evidently not worth putting any great thought into certainly not enough to actually answer any of the points at all and if anything you only seem moved to respond because I simply noted how long it took you to review then perhaps you should reconsider whether youve chosen the best area to spend your time volunteering here I see from your first failed Rfa and even from your second successful one that Im not the only person to wonder if your attitude towards others is fitting for the responsibility for adminship I also appear to have erred in assuming ErrantX was a longserving admin he was only given the bit in February and people were clearly concerned at his apparent interest in being an admin for being an admins sake If you both act like this as a norm in your admin activities then you guys should be very grateful that recall is one of the most broken aspects of Wikipedia Still thats definitely a subject for arbcom and arbcom alone Unless you like the embarrassment of reading about yourselves on the review I think wikis worst admins was one of their more recent topics
