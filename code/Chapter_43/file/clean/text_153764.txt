PS Sorry but I forgot to mention that I was referring to the articles talk page above of course As for how Medeis gets along with others just take a look at his talk page Im not the only one And to correct myself it should have been But that particular page seems to be one that is owned The owners  if Im right about this  dont bother with answering they leave that to Medeis or rather leave it to him to revert any disagreeable changes like calling a hypothesis a hypothesis instead of a proven fact One of the contributors has a vested interest as a researcher in this particular field  Cheerio
