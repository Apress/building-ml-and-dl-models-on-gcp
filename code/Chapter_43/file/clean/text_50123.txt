David Johnson footballer born 1976 

Hi mate its odd for me to have to thank you for decimating an article such as you did yesterday to the article on David Johnson footballer born 1976 Nevertheless that is what I must do as I spent most of last night scouring the BBCs archives using the Wayback machine a hell of a lot along the way and rewriting the entire page I wonder if you might take a look at the state of the article as it is now and perhaps give it a new quality rating on the talk page I was going to do it myself its probably up to Bclass by now but I dont feel thats appropriate after I spent the entire night working on it Cheers  Jay 
So what do you think it needs now to get it up to GAclass  Jay 
OK cheers mate Thanks for doing the review  Jay

Im verifying sources thank you very much Dont tell me how to work here Im a trusted user give me time to finish  talk 
I said let me work If you do not let me finish including the references I will report you Do NOT bully me  talk 
Just when I was clicking the edit button to finish including ALL the references it gets cancelled Thanks a lot I hope you are a very happy man now  talk 
What is it hard to understand Are you kidding me How old are you 15 I WANT TO SAVE THE REFERENCES BUT YOU KEEP REVERTING MY EDITS AND EVERYTHING GETS CANCELED  talk 

If you gave this person the chance to add the source your requirements would be satisfied as I suggested on my talk page   
It is disgusting attitudes from people like you that put me off Wikipedia I want to edit and add the references but thanks to your persistent reverts everything I write gets erased and so I have to revert your own revertions in the way I can then add the references Of course by the time I am about to save the references you revert all over again and it gets into a cat and mouse game to you doesnt it You play with peoples deaths in ways that go beyond absurd   talk 
Nice tone to use for an administrator Thank you for your so ever delightful insight You said you want references Ill give you references 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 All this for unreferenced material you never wanted me to complete  talk 
I want you to have an idea of all the minutes I devoted into writing all that which you unfairly reverted Im considering leaving Wikipedia for good Youve been one of the last straws but before I do anything further either leave Wikipedia or report you I want you to know all I did was done will
