For that matter about Tt1 I saw on your user talk page OK may be Nixer was cleared by Checkuser but you have no proofs that I am him I still time speak to you that you are sick socksomania May be my bad English language for you  proof but for me it not You write that I edit same articles but till now I edited only Army ranks and insignia of the Russian Federation article and any others I did not edit You cannot be the administrator as you are involved in war of editing and you are full of hatred to RoitrTt1 and consequently you cannot be objective As the administrator you should be neutral in those clauses about which you know nothing andto not accept the point of view of other users but you do on the contrary I am have not the same distaste for users that challenged Roitrs initial edits I am not at war with anybody but their edits for this article are erroneous I do not support your war also I do not support in it any party I only correct incorrect clauses So if you want continue to trust to Latinus and Nixer and continue to participate in infinite war In shortYOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYONE
