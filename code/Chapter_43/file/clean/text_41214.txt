Please also see the discussion page for the article on Ruairi O Bradaigh  It ends with this Well its not going back in this one One Night In Hackney303   This too seems entirely counter to the spirit of Wikipedia  What the editor One Night in Hackney is saying is that even if I can provide a source supporting my point that O Bradaigh does not refer to the event as the Border Campaign but as the Resistance Campaign One Night In Hackney will not allow it  Is this allowed under the rules of Wikipedia  As it is Ive provided references from the newspaper of the organization led by O Bradaigh and these are dismissed  Either One Night in Hackney cannot handle the research of other people or hes motivated by some political POV  Either way it should not be allowed

Ive tried to be reasonable  It does not work  How do I ask for higher help in resolving a dispute

Thank you
