What would really help would be a degree in paleontology with taphonomy

The article says this  Sometimes creationists will claim that fossilization can only take place when the matter is buried quickly so that the matter does not decompose26

The reference is this  Isaak 2007 p 137 Creationist claim CC363  At TalkOrigins

This is what TalkOrigins says

Claim CC363

Fossilization requires rapid burial or the organism will decay  This suggest that a catastrophe is responsible for the fossil

This is what W  M actually say 

The only way they organic remains can be preserved long enough from the usual processes of decay scavenging and disintegration is by means of quick burial in aqueous sediments

There is a big difference between an organism being saved from total destruction so that it might become a fossil and the fossilization processes of permineralization or carbonization etc which preserve the organism after it has been buried  TalkOrigins conflates the two  If you dont know the difference you dont have enough knowledge to judge what W  M said and probably dont understand how TalkOrigins blatantly lied

The above misrepresentation of W  M must be expunged from the article and a sentence reflecting what they actually say with a reliable source  TalkOrigins has no reliability as anyone can see especially in this case
