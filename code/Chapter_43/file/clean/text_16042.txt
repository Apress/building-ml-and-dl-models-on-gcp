At last to a finality

I thank you for inviting me to this MSN session to discuss on placing this compromise I am rather satsified with it While the oppossition led by this Australian wikipedian Grant65 cannot make satisfactory cases to distinguish Iraqs relevance from this article and why issues on Korea should be preserved Afterall the Japanese acts of brutality against Koreans are no more war crimes as AngloAustralian brutality against Aboriginal Australians that continues to this day Their earliest British ancestors have settled Australia by vice of terra nullius by meaning to fail to recognise the humanity of the native residents and have long mistreated the natives beyond the time of Japans tyrannical grip on Korea For this I put it to you

Come off it The Aboriginal people of Australian did not want and dont want to be part of the Commonwealth and subjects of the British Crown

Then by all means admit these acts of oppression against the Aborigines fit within the complete defintion of your so called war crimes
