In section C61 Kozima uses the phrase cold fusion phenomenon CFP In that context I equate cold fusion phenomenon CFP with nuclear transmutation However perhaps it would be better to summarize Kozima as follows
Hideo Kozima professor emeritus of physics at Shizuoka University asserts that an atomic analysis of microspheres which had been used in a Patterson Power Cell shows that the microspheres contain atoms that are the products of cold fusion phenomenon CFP
Kozima uses his TNCF model to explain the presence of the new atoms but it is probably not necessary to include a reference to that hypothesis
