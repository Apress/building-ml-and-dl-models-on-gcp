The only problem is that the Amy story holds a bit more weight  If you actually read more indepth into it people are inclinded to believe it is true  Unlike everyone you think its a HUGE MASSIVE RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY designed to discredit the antiwar leftist movement without any PROOF at all  There is no proof that MacBeth served in the Rangers at all nor was he Special Force  So why are you trying to discredit the Amy story in order to help MacBeth  Sorry but you have a hard time hiding your bias
