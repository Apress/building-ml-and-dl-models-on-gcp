Disputed 

This sentence was in the original article Each carried an amulet that would allegedly protect them against lead and steel  Is there an authentic reference to it It is very doubtful that a puritan movement would tolerate let alone condone the use of such superstition   0319 2004 Aug 18 UTC

 Grossly Incorrect 

This article contains gross inaccuracies  I have added the POV template  See the discussion under Muslim_BrotherhoodResearch_in_Progress  According to Brynjar Lias book which Ive cited there neither Banna nor his father studied at AlAzhar  According to Lia Banna was not an admirer of Hitler and strenuously denounced racism as well as the aggressive militarism characteristic of fascism  According to both Mitchell and Lia the Brotherhood maintained a policy of avoiding any involvement in World War II  Ive removed these sentences for now but I will correct this article more thoroughly within the next few weeks  1408 3 Jun 2005 UTC

I am restoring the following content which was deleted 0002 4 Jun 2005 UTC

 Education 

 Banna who had a sizable Islamic library at home was a graduate of alAzhar Theological Seminary a top Muslim seminary Shaikh noticed Hassans intelligence and sent him to memorize the Quran early in childhood Hassan memorized the entire Quran He was known for being very articulate as he gave sermons in Mosques at a young age
 Four years earlier than his peers Hassan attended Mosque of AlAzhar at the age of 16 where he graduated as the first in his class He refused a scholarship opportunity from The Ministry of Education in Europe

 ODESSA 

 Hassan al Banna was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and wrote supportive letters to Hitler Hassan was solicited by Nazi intelligence when Hitler rose to power In the 1930s He established a Nazi Germany spy network throughout the Arabian Peninsula for Hitler Al Banna promised Hitler that when Gen Rommels panzer division arrived in Cairo and Alexandria the Muslim Brotherhood would ensure that all of the British troops would be killed

This was removed by an anonymous editor with the claim that it is unproven nonsense 30 June 2005 0229 UTC

 Coffee Houses Comment 
Can anyone verify the comment that Coffee houses were morally suspect I find that difficult to believe Eqypt had a fairly freewheeling society at the time something Hassan AlBanna was against and one could do much worse than coffee houses

 Rewrite Using Scholarly Sources 

I have posted an entirely new text for the Muslim Brotherhood and
Hassan al Banna articles as well as several new articles

 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt 19281938
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt 19391954
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt 1954present
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria

This amounts to over 12000 words of text and is the result of months of research discussed in TalkMuslim_Brotherhood using reputable scholarly texts found at the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London  Every paragraph in the main articles is marked with pagenumber references to the work it is based on

I am not an expert on this subject and nothing in these articles is original I have simply summarised the material in the sources listed  Some of the sources are more favourable to the Muslim Brotherhood others are more critical  By attempting to represent accurately the accounts given in these sources I hope to have pro
