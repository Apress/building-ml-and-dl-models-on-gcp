After Bismarck
Looking at the fact that the period of time the first paragraph talks about is approximately 24 years long longer than the time Bismarck was in charge I doubt whether it is said enough about this period My English is relatively bad so I wont do it myself But here are some important issues
The militarism the article talks about as implemented by the emperor was a social phenomenon about which later Weimar politicians said that it was one reason for WW I Because of this all Germans were guilty for forcing the war and had to accept their responsibility In the article it looks like the population didnt support the militarism It was just the other war around Bismarcks policy of a satuierter Staat satisfied Country was not  strongly supported by the Germans
Also the sentence Ein Platz an der Sonne a place at the Sun should be mentioned It stands for the German demand for colonies

Also Wilhelm IIs fleet policy should be mentioned The german fleet was heavily expanded which made the British Empire look at Germany anxiously Politik der freien Hand

Also some of Wilhelm IIs unpredictable and foolish acts for example during the second moroccocrisis Panthersprung nach Agadir or as he wrote the Krüger Depesche to congratulate Paul Kruger for fighting down a riot of British settlers which was forced by the British government should be placed here 

Also a link to the Fashodacrisis and its solution and the Entente Cordiale or the Triple Entente should be amended as they were referred as a surrounding of Germany by enemies Umringt von Feinden

Another matter is that it is not clear whether Bismarck himself would have been able to keep up his system of treaties for a longer period of time because of its complexity Some historians believe that this system had to lead to a new European war it only was the question when
I hope that an Englishspeaking person will read this and will take him or herself some time to think of the things I tried to point out
Indeed it is necessary as the history part of the Germany article is lets say  short They are not even mentioning the Rhine confederation Mit freundlichem Gruße
