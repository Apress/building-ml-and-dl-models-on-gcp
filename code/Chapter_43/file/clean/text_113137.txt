Let me try to clear this up 

Hi Memlikelmendi My name is Qwyrxian and Im an administrator here at Wikipedia I wanted to try to explain what happened above in simpler terms The first most important thing is that as a general rule you should not try to write an article about yourself This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good wellsourced neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with As such once you are notable enough someone will eventually make an article on you If you really want to try to make an article on yourself you should try to use the Articles for Creation process since that will allow another editor to review your work and give suggestions

The other reason why the article was deleted which is tied in to what I said above is that the article was overly promotional It used excessive praising language for the composer which violates WPNPOV Moreover it didnt have any references to have an article a subject must have been discussed in detail in multiple independent reliable sources If you want to continue to pursue this article and if Mendi has ben written about in such sources feel free to leave a message on my talk page and I will try to help
