Tonhalle Z端rich 

After the successful Konzerthaus Dortmund I suggest a new candidate Tonhalle Z端rich which should describe the hall of tradition In German it is a redirect to deKongresshaus Z端rich but look at the in English Tonhalle takes you to townhall which is nonsense and most articles use Tonhalle Orchester Z端rich which is not useful if another orchestra plays there
