The article Castles may exist but the author is stubborn about allowing users to add accurate info and is bias against certain regions of Europe The author seems discriminatory against certain info I find this not in keeping with wikis universal policy I had no choice but to create an modified article For example a particular castle in Spain is now called King Charles Vs Castle The old and unused name of the castle is Alc√°zar of Segovia Everyone in Spain calls this castle by King Charles Vs Castle not Alcazar of Segovia The author refuses to accept this fact though I provided solid sources supporting this historic truth The author is biased against Spanish historical inferences for reasons I have yet to understand He is not flexible If he can remove his biasness and allow me to add my info backed by sources then I will not create a new article However if the author continues to be stubborn and discriminatory about the matter I will have no choice but to create an accurate version Fair is fair
