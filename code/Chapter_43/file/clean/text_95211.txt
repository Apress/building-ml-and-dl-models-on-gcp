 Nice use of contribution history and bold and italics The Buck buck photo you are so worked up about makes a claim of PD but not of being the photographer as I noted on your talk Novaseminary talk  Well Ken is obviously not interested in any posts to his talk page Here was my question cut and pasted from what Ken deleted unread from his talk maybe if he is monitoring here he will help Or maybe not I didnt mean to irritate you or get into it with you on the three photos I tagged One of them seemed to have been pulled from a student server and the PD status seemed unclear to me You just reverted what I thought to be good tags without explaining why or pointing to a policy that allows for it I had tagged several similar files ages ago and they were deleted with a few coming through with OYTRS and staying Anyway of the few files I tagged just now you did not revert my tag on this logo Do you agree with the tag This seems to me to be precisely the type of thing we need OTRS persmission for  a file from a commercial website now claimed by an uploader to be released I dont mean to be a pain and maybe you are not interested in helping others out but if you disagree with this one maybe you could briefly explain why Novaseminary talk
