General comment Here is a grouping of portals that could be added to the economics bar instead of having just one out side the sphere one namely business Singling out a business related portal on this particular article seems antithetical really to the subject as ecology is the bottom line as regards this subject I would think a big improvement in the economics side bar could be made by having a section related to other portals of which business would or could also be one I would then not object to the economics side bar at all here as it would be balanced by other information
