Gjalexei you asked about whether there is an antieditorializing policy here  There is and its called wikipedianeutral point of view  It discusses at some length  the case of what we should do when writing about a subject which most of us find repugnant  Whilst youre not likely to get too many defenders of FGM here the need for the policy should be clearer for articles like abortion for instance

If something you write is edited and youre not sure why please continue to question such edits on the talk page  Sometimes youll learn more about wikipedia policy  Sometimes youll find out that some other people working on here can get it flatout wrong  Robert Merkel
