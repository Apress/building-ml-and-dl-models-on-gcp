We can have material split across three articles if that is the best way to do it  Or we can have two articles with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism or vice versa  The advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue  The disadvantage is duplication  

The problem I have with the current article is that it isnt clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and old antisemitism is or even if there is one  Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism I think theres a problem  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists but I dont see what that difference is

The current introduction says that new antisemitism is the wave of antisemitism that escalated particularly in Western Europe after the Second Intifada in 2000 the failure of the Oslo accords and the September 11 2001 attacks But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism was largely associated with the political right  So Im confused  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing or is it more to do with the source in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites a new chorus singing an old song  In the introduction we mention antizionism in passing but we dont make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is we just say that there is one

The history section talks about a Soviet new antiSemitism and says this antisemtism was close to its modern form  But it doesnt explain what close means  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different but the article doesnt explain what they are

Further down we seem to be equating new antisemitism with antizionism  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article  We have antizionism hatred ofopposition to an jewish state  We have antisemitism hatred ofopposition to the jewish race common usage technically arabs are also semites but lets not go there now   We can also identify antiIsrael sentiment opposition to some or all aspects of Israel  These things all overlap but its hard to say that any of them are the same or a subset of each other  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was manmade not created by god  And some dislike of Israel is antisemitic but not all of it  The boundaries are fuzzy but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core  I cant say that for newantisemtism  I cant identify what newantisemitism is that oldantisemtism is not

To me new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues  1 the apparent resurgence in antisemitism which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism 2 the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimateillegitimate criticism of israel which I suggest belongs here or possibly at antizionism and 3 the changing nature of the antisemite leftrightarabeuropeanrussian which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism andor at antisemitism  Regards Ben Aveling
