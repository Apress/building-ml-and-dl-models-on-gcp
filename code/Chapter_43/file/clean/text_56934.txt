Your welcome note 

Thank you for your welcome note on my page and pointing out a socalled edit war Perhaps you can assist  Several editors have tried to create pages related to a US battle called the Doolitle Raid from WWII  However there are 2 administrators who dont like the pages and have unilaterally deleted every page created without any opportunity to reach a socalled consensus on a talk page  We are creating pages to honor the contribution of war heros who risked heir lives in a landmark mission  Wikipedia is litttered with pages of people who are of dubious notability yet these pages survive  The Doolittle arcades are notable people and deserve to be discussed in this forum  Please warn these administrators that their opinions are not shared by others and that these page will be recreated by those who recognize the notability of the Doolittle Raiders  Thank you
