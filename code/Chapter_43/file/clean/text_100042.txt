You are kind to offer but dont worry about it I am content to sit it out  Id had BEER  DRINK shouted in my face seven or eight times by what seemed to be a genuinely drunk belligerent and yes witless and oafish editor  I can see that in a quick scan of the talk page words like moron stand out as seeming violations  This is one of my frustrations with the notion of civility on Wikipedia that  like the core content policies  it too can be gamed  You can show up as the editor in question showed up write demeaning things about several editors further insult their intelligence with a genuinely bogus not dubious bogus argument about sources to wit likening Haaretz Israels most influential newspaper to the Cedar Rapids Gazette arguing that its of limited weight and significance in an article about IsraelPalestine because of the size of its print run then deny having made that statement shrieking Strawman Strawman then say that others lack the grace or honesty to admit that theyre lying about it then make the statement again then deny the statement accuse everyone of dishonesty while refusing to clarify the statement then start playing a drinking game and shouting BEER oafishly and halitotically in peoples faces until

Until someone points out that youre behaving like a consummate jackass at which point said editor gets blocked

Its not your fault per se but as long as civility guidelines are enforced merely by scanning for namecalling with no attention to chronic patterns of harassment disruption witless bullying and lowlevel trolling even on the part of established editors and admins this is going to remain a problem
