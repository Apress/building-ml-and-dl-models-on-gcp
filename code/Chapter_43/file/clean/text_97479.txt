The paragraph is still misleading in that it infers that Noel Stanton was the Baptist pastor rather than being within the Baptist laity at Bugbrooke at the time 
There are a number of references to Pastor  Elder  Senior Elder Noel Stanton around these are commonly references to his position within the Jesus Fellowship Church rather than his position within the Baptist church Rather than suggest citations which refer to Mr Stanton as the pastor back then are inaccurately researched after rereading them with this in mind and knowing he was the pastor of his jesus fellowship at the time that they where written should clarify matters
There are significant differences between being a lay person  lay leader  lay preacher  lay pastor and being a pastor within the Baptist church The article should reflect the difference accurately by describing Mr Stanton as being amongst the laity The use of lay pastor as cited above factually or lay preacher would accurately describe this reverend as i suggested earlier is simply a polite title which Mr Stanton has been given on numerous occasions which does not indicate a level of authority within a church body and could also be used
