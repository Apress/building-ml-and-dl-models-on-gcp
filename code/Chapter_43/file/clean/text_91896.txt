Dear Lex Thanks for your clarification of Judge Learned Hand I guess I should not trust my memory

The only times I remember citing blogs were the WSJwhen I cited the article not the commentary which was an interview That was deletedand when I used them as evidence of pro se dissatisfaction  I see that you also deleted a quote of a court case that was in a blog  I am positive that that was an accurate quote of a transcript with a statement by a federal judge  I will have to go read up on Wikipedia sources again

Also I am positive that the quote about the federal district court discouraging pro ses from using their mediation is correct but I will have to check on the link  Why didnt you just flag the source instead of deleting it

Please dont insult me  I am not trying to insult you

Other than my complaints of censorship please provide three examples of what you claim was my disruptive editing  Or do you just want to go on with the article from where we are

This is an example of an unsupported statement in the article that I dont believe is true The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits even if resolution requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal While this rule creates a double standard  I think this means pro se litigants get an unfair advantage Wasnt it you that wrote that
FYI I was put in jail  for over 4 months solely for engaging in pro se litigation  The only way I could get out was to agree to withdraw all pro se litigation My husband was threatened w jail for paying for me to file a complaint while I was in jail and paying for a typist  And no I dont believe there is a a history of putting people in jail who think the rules dont apply to them and who cant conform themselves to them  To the best of my knowledge in civilized countries people are only put in jail for committing crimes and as far as summary contempt use of jail is very limited  I saw an article for instance about a judge who put a whole courtroom in jail for 2 hours because of an objectionable ringing  cell phone
