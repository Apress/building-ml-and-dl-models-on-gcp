Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher I dont know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia except someones hostility to Catholicism If we exclude Górny then we should also exclude CarrolCruz catholic writer as well and Nickell sceptical writer who is much more biased against any relics than any Catholic source so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article The statement is an opinion cited not a fact Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet anyone can publish whatever wants In the lead we have two negative opinions by Erasmus from 1500s and by Thurston from 1913 So the lead is not neutral To balance it we have posititve GórnyRosikoń opinion from 2013 much more recent after several researches on some relics described in their book have been published
