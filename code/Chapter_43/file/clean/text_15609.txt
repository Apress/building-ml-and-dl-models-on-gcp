Id say musicians since the term band does suggest a smaller number of performers than is present in a typical Cirque presentation Ive seen 6 of the shows 3 touring and 3 resident hardly an authority but still  Similarly orchestra suggests a larger number but I guess it really depends upon the context  Speaking of context does anyone have any better copy for the LOVE subheading  It reads just like a press release or advertisement with lots of peacock words and the Only at The Mirage at the end
