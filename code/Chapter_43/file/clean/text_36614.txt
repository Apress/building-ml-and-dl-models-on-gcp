I agree with Demiurge1000 Stanistani please lift the ban on the account bryansee on Wikipediocracycom I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material And you dont aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet You dont seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet And dont do anything to harmdestroy my computer with input devicedisabling malware Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime and no one has done a darn thing about it if they dont want to be immediately killed beaten or received intimidating death threats BatteryIncluded Dennis Brown AGK and Boing said Zebedee are said to be a part of them They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible accurate and correct They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well This is why they hate them as well
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well
 This explains the unevenly enforced extreme and heavyhanded rules enacted by the Wikipedia community BatteryIncluded is such a prime example Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well  BatteryIncludeds ally forcedmemefred is the first one  trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment
 Wikipedia editors such as  died last April in a rockclimbing accident Although a loss for Wikipedia her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a human sacrifice BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as shes well meaning that she has cured her paranoia This may apply to me and you as well as we have signed separate death warrants I think I have to say that any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia instead it will be deadly to people I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one but also Wikipediocracy by  as Zoloft Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme via forcedmemefred
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia just as what Ive did
 And these events have signalled a neoluddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events namely computers being the cause of peoples paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded forcedmemefred and his subordinates Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one Ive ever seen on the Internet
 He gives people kittens Kittens may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens
 He has the reputation of distorting peoples histories
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication as well as making death threats in the guise of seeing a doctortherapist advices as well as inciting neoluddism against computers
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading and truth is based on whoever edits last This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days and is a lost cause

So you still ignore my comments there do you Stanistani 103244189183
