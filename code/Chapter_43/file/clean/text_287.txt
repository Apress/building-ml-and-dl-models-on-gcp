The problem is that people keep trying to state that BSAs policies are this and that  There is no policy that says homosexual scouts cannot be members  To state otherwise is a lie and OR  Just be it is a contraversy page doesnt allow you state lies or add OR you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that  Even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources  Just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesnt mean anyone in mainstream has  Can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth  Then insert it  Unless you have it or an actual policy from BSA that says you cant be an openly homosexual youth member then what is being added is OR
