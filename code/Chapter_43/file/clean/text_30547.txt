Nerp sorry I saw it clearly said Martin Luther King Jr I also clicked the link and I know the difference between MLK and Martin Luther the most obvious being skin color Someone was changing it to Martin Luther King Im not familiar with the speeches of Martin Luther but in any case the quote in dispute is from Mussolini And I promise I clearly saw it read Martin Luther King Unless someone drugged me and Ive been hallucinating
