I think the he was ruled out for there previous matches but they knew he would be ok to play in this one So thats why it was a welcome sight to see his first appearance of the season If you do a google news archive search there is nothing about the injury leading up to the match  whereas there are several results from before  Therefore I think he was not a doubt leading up to the match But he clearly had been injured in the previous weeks
