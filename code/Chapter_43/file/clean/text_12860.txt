You bet your ass its inappropriate We dont appreciate foreigners like you referring to Avram Iancu a national hero as someone famous for killing a lot of Hungarians  

Political bias

Ive reverted the last edits to the last version by Bogdangiusca Obviously POV using words like extremely mationalist and an affront to the Hungarian community have no place in an encyclopedia article whose role is to inform readers about said person nothing more If you have strong opinions about a politician write them on your own website Wikipedia can not be used for
Praising a politician
Providing negative propaganda about a politician
If you want to do those things it is your right just not here Its not up to you to judge whether Funars municipal modifications were antiHungarian or whatnot since I can sure as hell list a whole list of antiRomanian actions that the UDMR has done in its history
