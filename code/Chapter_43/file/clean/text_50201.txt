Malabarian Jewish  Nasrani tradition

Hi Veliath you are right the page Nasrani should be redirected to the page Syrian malabar nasrani or to the page Syriac Christianity

it was originally redirected to Syriac Christianity but several vandals tampered with the pages on syrian malabar nasrani and st thomas christians In fact there was an entire section on st thomas christians explaining its nasrani context which was systematically destroyed by vandals Instead they wrote in factually inaccurate statements about the st thomas christians being marathas and telegu which is still there on the page Saint Thomas Christians

here I post to you the passages destroyed by the vandals



This article deals with the Saint Thomas Christian churches and denominations of the Nasrani people

The Saint Thomas Christians Malayalam Nasrani are a group of Christians from the Malabar coast now Kerala in South India who follow Syriac Christianity The different groups and denominations within the St Thomas Christians together form the Nasrani people Their tradition goes back to the very beginnings of first century Christian thought and the seven churches that are believed to have been established by St Thomas the Apostle

Nasrani and Saint Thomas Christian tradition

The Nasranis are an ethnic people and in that sense a single community However the Nasranis have various denominations as a result of Portuguese persecution As an ethnic community they refer to themselves as Nasranis referring to the common cultural heritage and cultural tradition However as a religious group they refer to themselves as the Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians referring to the various and diverse religious denominations between them in terms of their religious tradition despite a common ancestory of being the descendants of the early Mar Thoma church or Saint Thomas tradition of Christianity

These first century churches according to tradition were from north to south Palayoor near GuruvayoorKunnankulam Cranganore believed to be the ancient Muziris of Pliny and the Periplus on the north bank of Periyar River today Paravoor on the south side of Periyar Gokkamangalam or Kokkamangalam Niranam Chayal or Nilakkal the only inland church and the Lakes or Kaayals and finally Kollam The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Song of Thomas Ramban set into modern writing c 1500
