Going through your edit history it would appear that you do absolutely nothing other than propose random articles for deletion  I regret to inform you that this one wont be deleted as its plainly notable  The fact that youve never heard of it does not qualify it for deletion  A quick Google search could have told you that the film was notable  Next time perhaps you should actually do some research about the subjects of articles before trying to have the articles deleted because Ive never heard of it so its clearly not notable  Regardless I have expanded the article to include some more sources
