need update to 1st source in lede that src now says Multiregional took away RAOs formerly mainstream status in the books 2012 edition  Also reasons to support a long ignored proposal to unlock the article 

A new edition of The Essence of Anthropology by McBride B Haviland WE Prins HEL Walrath D is available dated 2012  This article is still citing the 2009 edition of the same book

Note that the new 2012 edition says  on pg 94
Until 2010 the recent African origins hypothesis was the mainstream position But when researchers from the Max Planck Institute released a study comparing the Neanderthal genomethe genetic evidence shifted to supporting the multiregional hypothesis19

This articles statement of RAO being the most widely accepted model was relying on the outdated 2009 edition of this book having said on pg 90 of the 2009 edition that RAO is the mainstream position the sentence involving what is mainstream was revised in the 2012 edition to say that the evidence now supports the multiregional hypothesis

This articles first sentence should therefore read edits are in italics dubbed the Out of Africa theory was the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans until the Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans gained favour





Also who has kept the article locked for years and what is their reason for why it is still locked Are the sources for each of these competing hypotheses so dubious and disputed

And did the proRAO vandal himself lock this article and then quit WP or has had his account suspended or what
Why else is there no response to complaints about this article being locked for such a longterm but that the one who locked it has long ignored this article and cannot be trusted to lock articles if he is even still a WP member Per the factbased accusations that were raised in the above topics in this Talk page it should be unlocked in order to add the discoveries Id say recent discoveries except that 2010 isnt recent which again exhibits that nobody holding a WP account is responsible enough to be trusted with the locking of this article especially not an anthropologist or even anthro student because if this article had even one expert editor he should recognise immediately that the above edit requests are from veracious sources and are the reasons for the requests are explained explicitly enough that anyone worth their salt should comprehend whats being requested

Others posing this question about why this article is locked have been unanswered for roughly a year so who locked this article then ignored this badly neglected scientifically outdated article for so long And ironically the people who want it unlocked are desiring to update this article with recent facts ie discoveries that refute RAO so obviously none of us are the proRAO vandal but this article was locked for years literally even before that complaint of a list of edits by a proRAO vandal was raised on the Talk page again raising my question Did the proRAO vandal make his edits to corrupt the veracity of this article and then skip town so to speak 2099720360
