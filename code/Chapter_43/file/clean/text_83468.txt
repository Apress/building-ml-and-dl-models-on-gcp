Firstly the Nairs were prominent from far earlier than the 16th centuryeg the Aaruveetil Madambis who were sent in 823 AD to protect the Kandiyur templeinscriptions dating back a 1000 years mentioning these Madambis even today exist in Kandiyur Ambalam So that point stating that they gained ascendancy because of Namboodiris is wrong These 6 Madambis were Kiriyathil Nairs who donot allow their womenfolk to marry from other castes Nevertheless ive heard of the cold war that exists between the Nairs and Ezhavas and very often i hear that the NSS and SNDP keep opposing each other etc etc
