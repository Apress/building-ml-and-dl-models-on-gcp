Galleries
Hello again I also have a small suggestion Since you are creating articles with a lot of pictures I am wondering if you are familiar with the gallery option With this option you create a gallery in which the pictures are perfectly positioned regardless of the screen resulotion you are using the way you were making a gallery is also okay but the gallery displayes rather messy on the computer I am using I changed your new Melanargia article using this See how it looks here

Cheers
