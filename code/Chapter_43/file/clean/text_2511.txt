Generally the colors of a persons signature match their userpage format in addition this user page style is really personal to me because it reflects my personality ie light blue etc So I really would appreciate if a user copies my page layouts to talk to me first as well as credits me then tweaks the changes to their colors etc  I will fix your userpage throughout the day with the userboxes etc and I can see what I can do with miszabot
