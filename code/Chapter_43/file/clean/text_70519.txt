Its quite rude to delete a discussion half way through when the other person is still drafting a reply to your last comment Anwyay it was too good to waste so here it is

Wow You mean after three days with absolutely no updates from the police its now dropping down the order of the news What a really convincing well thought out and utterly persausive point to make to defeat the argument that for the last two days the arrest was front page news on all serious credible international websites Except Wikipedia A point made on your talk page Where nobody will see it After you closed the section asking for reasons why this was rejected Yes I can see why someone like you is going to be baffled by all sorts of things that happen in the real world You better stick to Wikipedia Im thinking this is probably the only place where anyone takes you seriously Its pretty obvious how youre operating here  you really shouldnt be using word like consensus not when there are far more appropriate words to describe the way youre trying to influence things here Its quite clear you personally dont think it should have been news so youre doing everything in your meagre powers to make that happen I suppose you can succeed because there just arent enough honest people here to monitor such things As we see asking why certain arguments were apparently listened to even though they were patently false gets people nowhere Certianly not with you around Im thinking maybe I chose the wrong poster boy I think you fit the bill more than 331dot does
