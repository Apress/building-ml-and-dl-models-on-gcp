Hmm Im not sure about this one I think that Guys addition is similar to the allowed example from WPSELF  the name of the alleged victim is not being included in this article or at this time It said The purpose of the list is to help readers who wish to I think in whatever reproduction in whatever medium it is still going to be identified as a list and it will still have readers although that may be doubtful in an audio format I think the doubt comes over the next part of the sentence to know more about these scientists views I agree with that but we have an RFC going on above partly to determine exactly what is the purpose of this list In short I think that the use of Wikipedias voice to state the purpose of the list is legitimate under WPSELF and may be required under WPSTAND but that the actual purpose of the list is what needs discussion and agreement before we can state it definitively
