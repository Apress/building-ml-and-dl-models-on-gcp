Dont try to argue with me over semantics It doesnt matter whether I called it my page or the page that I wrote because you get the point I didnt edit an existing page I took the time to create my own page and it was taken down and the message AS I STATED BEFORE had YOUR NAME at the end of end it whether you deleted it or not the message was from YOU so it was YOU that I replied to Im already over it I dont care about complaining to an admin because that will get me nowhere but I dont appreciate your condescending tone or the fact that you tried to call me out on the ownership thing So from now on if you dont want people writing you messages like this one then dont put your name at the end of the deleted page messages In fact I had already received a notification on that from another person I dont know who you are or what your little job is with this website but you need to tighten up if you want anyone to respect you at all
