Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29Apr2010 It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment to include numerous other sources Originally that section was quickly created to begin the topic At first the issue was treated as a he said she said dispute when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims However now there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section including
 In June 2009 Knox testified they repeatedly asked Did you hear Meredith scream and she replied no no and no When they insisted how was that possible she claims that she said I dont know perhaps I had my fingers in my ears That became Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming invented false confession
 Knoxs father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda for years
 Knoxs father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect
 One of the police officers from that night testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming not hearsay
 Patrik L Knoxs boss at the pub Le Chic stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day
 Author Douglas Preston in several reports has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor and commented about that in relation to Knoxs testimony
All such statements are allowed per Wikipedia policies because they are not WPSYN synthesis but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment The current text of the section must be expanded per WPNOTCENSORED and WPNOTPAPER Expect the article to exceed 200kb when similar basic details have been added
