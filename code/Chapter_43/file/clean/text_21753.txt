Thanks for the mebrane work 

Thank you for working on that article  There was a big snarl with different articles duplicating each other and redirecting in strange ways I kinda cleaned up that in terms of which articles exist but this one still needs work  Artifical membrane has pretty decent content as does cell membrane at lower levels of the heirarchy  I am thinkming of getting an article on ePTFE written
