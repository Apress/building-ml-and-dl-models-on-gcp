What does the statement on Islam have to do with anything 

In the opening part of this article it states

Islamic beliefs include many miracles of healing and of resurrection of the dead9

But the article is Miracles attributed to Jesus I have no idea what that sentence about Islam has to do with anything It does not relate itself to the article It doesnt say Islam includes belief in the miracles of Jesus Either this sentence needs to be reworked or eliminated if it is not relevant
