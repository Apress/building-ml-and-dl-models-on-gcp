AntiPunk Ignorant 

The above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided That user is me I never once posted that alternative rock did not come from Punk I suggest that you get your facts straight What I said was grunge is not punk I have been a hard core punk and a neopunk since 1979 Since the early 90s Ive been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90s decade while separating ir from influences of grunge 

I will be blunt and unapologetic again Punk IS NOT grunge Never has been and never will be Obviously from your answer you do not know anything about punk its fashion history or its influences Punk is a genre in and of itself It didnt spring from anything known at the time it was born it obviously didnt come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music I should know since I have almost 30 years experience as a punk have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats and even made recommendations to them in the early 80s 

This antipunk clown therefore clearly does not know what he is talking about He doesnt know anything even remotely relating to punk He accused me of stating that punk did not come from alternative music To correct you I stated that punk IS NOT grunge Dont make this same mistake again because it demonstates your low level of knowledge in this area and hugely dents your credibility This shows that you do not like punk for some personal reason which wiki and I find very disturbing Calm down You are not correct in your statements
