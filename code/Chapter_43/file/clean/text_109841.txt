Answer to the questions
Does it still form H2 or more complex compounds
Does it form compounds with any other elements
What are its density melting and boiling points
What does it take to convert it back to hydrogen
Miscibility in solvents
1 In addition H1n2 where n is an integer  1 representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals
2 Hydrinos being a gas there is no specific density it may have Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place
3 High energy radiation
4 Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances Hydrinos being a gas with an effective crosssection much less than ordinary than hydrogen would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter in such a manner that it will easily escape into space
