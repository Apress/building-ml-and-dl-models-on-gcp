Three times no
I did not insert 273 killed I inserted less than 273 killed 
I did not put back the old reports for HRW I put them back because they were the only Memorial source and I said so in my edit just above this one 
The source about 300400 says that is a starting point but that refers to the sentence just before which talks about possible deads not sure deads 
I kindly ask you to read my edits carefully and not to misquote me
