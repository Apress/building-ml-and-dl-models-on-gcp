Freedom rides 

Greyhound buses were used during the historically famous or infamous Freedom Rides of the Civil Rights Movement Shouldnt there be a link on this site with the Wikipedia article about the Freedom Rides inserted within the history section of the company during the 1960s If you go to this site looking for Freedom Rides info you wont find it here and that seems an odd omission in light of the companys important role in US history  Many have seen the iconic Life Magazine photo of the burning Greyhound bus and might look here first for info
