Thank you and a headsup 
MinisterForBadTimes I post this note specifically on your talk page because by reference to your lengthy list of contributions concerning ancient Greece you seem to be knowledgeable on the topic concerned  Ancient_Greece needs some good scholarly work on the social structure section which concerns itself almost entirely with slaves  Ive written a note on the talk page  I discovered the narrow focus while researching the social status of iatrosphysicians in ancient Greece and realized there was very little info regarding any profession  Your help would be greatly appreciated
