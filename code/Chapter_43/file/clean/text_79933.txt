Peace walk
Of course Satish Kumar and his companion used ships to cross the channel and the atlantic something I know all about myself see Pet passport I have changed the article but I think people can figure out for themselves that Satish did not cross water no more than Jesus so please do not vandalise my site 2052 25 Oct 2004 UTC

Wikipedia is no more your site than it is any of ours And that was a valid question  people have walked on water with the help of large flotation skis  2233 25 Oct 2004 UTC

Kumar could not have walked across water in the sixties on Flotation skis because they had not been invented Besides which you could have asked not did they walk on water but did they cross water on flotation skis If they had done so in the sixties across the Atlantic we would all know about it At the very least your comment was absurd and your excuses lame It is not my wiki but I have the right to keep it clean 1341 26 Oct 2004 UTC
