I like moving down  clarifying the not a state function part as this is meaningless to the general reader  Something about microscopic constituents should stay because it is a good pedagogy for visualizing what heat can be even if not in the most general case  Dissipative is important and slightly easier to understand than not a state function but could be explained  Is this meant to address my concerns in previous section or is it separate from that
