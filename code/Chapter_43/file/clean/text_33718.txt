Does really need a Rewrite
I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism 

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism In some Fascistic sense maybe Marxism is supposed to be about an economicsocial science Darwin about biological science Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic if it even is analytic at all In fact Marxs precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latters idealist teleology and his focus on identity hence Marxs book the Poverty of Philosophy and then to take synthetic dialectical method and apply it to material history This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology but misleading about other topics as well There is a debate to be had about Marxism and teleology but this has not been written here
