I think that might make the problem worse not better  the more this page appeasr to lean towards art ceramics the more difficult it is to deal with everything applied arts in the middle that is neither industrial nor fine art I would rather see this page as a counterweight to Ceramic which is about industrial and scientific uses and have it deal with artistic AND domestic ceramics  I must admit a concise title to cover that escapes me just at the moment
