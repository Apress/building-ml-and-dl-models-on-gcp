Youtube link 

I had added a reference link to a youtube video of this incident then somebody reverted it

Certainly youtube raises some Napsterlike issues but it seems to be a lot more acceptable to the big media outlets so I really have to wonder if adding a youtube link raises copyright violation issues for Wikipedia

Rather httpenwikipediaorgwikiWPWEB states that Webspecific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria

3 The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators either through an online newspaper or magazine an online publisher or an online broadcaster

Doesnt youtube really seem to fall into this category

I admit that Id rather see the video be completely public domain but failing that I really wonder if a youtube link to a video of this incident isnt appropriate here
