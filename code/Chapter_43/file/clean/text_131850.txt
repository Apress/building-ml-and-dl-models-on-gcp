Hello
Hi Hertz I want to introduce myself My name is Nate I noticed that you are an active editor and participant to the article on Radio Let me say congrats on the great work that you do The reason why I am writing to you is to give a fair warning A few days ago I made an edit or two to the article on the Marconi vs US case that essentially gave the radio patent to Tesla in 1943 The references I gave as you probably saw were reliable and verifiable  however as you also probably saw I think I may have stirred the pot Anything pinning Tesla to the underlying principles of radio is never acceptable to another editor on that article Magnagr So I wanted to warn you I have fought him tooth and nail for over a year over this agonizing subject Ive reverted several of his unsourced edits but he will not rest until he fulfills his agenda His current user name is not even his first as he has several registered accounts on Wikipedia I have a feeling that nationaliatic pride is also playing at hand here with him as I think he told me once that he was Italian Hence that is why he would want to only accredit Marconi as the sole contributor to radio So it is just a warning You and the others should be prepared to fight this with him as he will never stop I gave up a long time ago I have radio on my watch list so I will be following along and keeping my eyes open to the edits he makes But you should as well pay very very  close attention what he does If i can be only any help or assistance please contact me at your leisure
