I dont understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the womens groups in India maintain The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it The rushed through new antirape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Vermas proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities i am adding four tildas now but I presume thats wrong desmond coutinho
