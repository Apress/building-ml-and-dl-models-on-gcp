This is difficult because I never learnt all the different names for the parts of English grammar when I was in school only how to use them  

Taking the commas first strictly speaking you are possibly correct in that they could  or even should  be used in the places that you indicate  However stylistically it is very bad to split sentences up into very small bits unless absolutely necessary and it is much better to have a flowing sentence than to implement punctuation that makes the prose harder to read  

With the Churchill devoted his time to educating himself sentence another way of putting it is to say that he allocated all of his free time to educating himself if you used educate it would indicate a future goal not an ongoing conditionthere wasnt a point at which his education would be complete  From the website you supplied I think this page might help at Using Other Tenses in Conjunction with Simple Tenses  

Hope this helps  On the other hand I know that sometimes I make things more complicated than they actually are
