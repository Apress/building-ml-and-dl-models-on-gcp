Interesting  I think Ill keep this thread now  Its a very clear example of admin abuse  Because I didnt take your crap on my talk page you personally blocked my account to spite me  Thats pretty amazing  I mean you cant possibly justify it based on the fact that I pointed out that another editor was a supporter of Lehi  I notice that you have a history of throwing around disputed accusations of incivility

Review your own comments on this page  They are a series of taunts and threats  Each time I failed to rise to the challenge and point out what of person you are  I didnt irritate you with a big orange bar by taking it to your talk page

Anyway there is no point talking to you  You were losing a debate and so restricted your opponents ability to act and reply  Shows how strong your argument is
