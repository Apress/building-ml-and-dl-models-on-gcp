course I did then moments later notified you I still cant work out why youre so angry when this should be about doing whats best for Wikipedia and the RfA is going really well and thats what really counts Ive apologised and this isnt acceptable to you so as far as Im concerned you can take your bad attitude elsewhere Glen 

Dont talk to me like that please I have made no personal attacks on you no profane language  only made a very well put arguement Indeed I am angry but I am not expressing it in my writings to you Do angry uncivil people say indeed I doubt it I made abundantly clear I wanted to nom  I thoguht you understood that as you did say on Rianas talk page that that was fine Just because she asked you didnt mean you had to do it But becasue you actually really wanted to you gave no thought to if it would hurt my feelings  went ahead with the nomination Make no mistake Im angry with Riana as well as she also knew my intentions You posts on Sarahs talk was intriguing as well as you state that I created 2 more RfA pages for Riana immediately after the declined one I only created one  that was 2 months later So dont mistake internal anger  external calmness with anthing else You both hurt my feelings as I made several posts about how I wanted to nom or at least conom Riana could have waited as Im not on here 247 as I too have a life to live I would have easily waited another day for someone who not only nominated me first but was also my friend before superimposing on the RfA page But again I think you  Riana have different standards to mine  had no problem hurting anothers feelings  

Ahem I have no problems letting you guys nominate her first  this is what you call no problems Glen 

Yeah but you said after that that it was in fact fine Besides I only said that because you were pushing that you wanted to nominate I never thought youd be so cruel as to not actually let me nominate But anyway it doesnt matter now Im trying to distance myself from the situation  

Ouch Mates Im sorry this is all my fault I forgot to include s nomination statement as well Ive been incredibly busy and not really giving my full attention to the RfA because I have a dad dying in hospital So if anything is amiss its all my fault please dont blame Glen or Sarah Spawn Man Ive just had more important things on my mind than RfA Im trying to have a look from time to time though Sorry about the trouble Glen Ill leave Spawn Man a message on his talk _dzasta 

Dont bother Riana Im not responding to anyone right now  
Thanks for the thought Glen  Dont worry Im not gonna make a fuss about it onwiki But I just thought you guys needed something to excuse my neglect Anyway thanks again _dzasta
