Colipon Rjanags action was not neutral The image I tried to show was Rebiya Kadeers own TV interview image holding that old photo and accusing China of deploying army and military and actually beat Uyghur protesters That was Rebiyas justification for the massacre occurred in Urumuqi Thus the picture was quite significant it had blood on it But I did not write anything I only posted the image without any comment The image is for all people of conscience to see and judge People deserve to know the truth of the matter There is blood spilled So the question we ought to ask is why these people are trying to hide the truth why they are so afraid of the truth
