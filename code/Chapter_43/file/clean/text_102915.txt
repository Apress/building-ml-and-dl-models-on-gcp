PMK first something personal  I think that I am familiar with a part of the problem I have been in Gora and I dont agree that they are Macedonians Gora even is outside of the region of Macedonia I have been in Reka in Plasnica and Lisichani in Kichevo region where the Turkish influence is very high etc
I can not accept your POV that Pomak or other names are offensive You should provide sources about this claim However let us imagine that these names are offensive  look the text in the article after Torbe≈° the latter name is slightly pejorative What exactly is the problem to make such formulation for the other alternative names
The term Pomak is exonim for more of these communities Pomak was accepted only from some Slavspeaking Muslims in Tikvesh and in Aegean Macedonoia but now the biggest part these communities are displaced from the region of Macedonia This was one of the reasons for my proposal for a compromise when I added in historical context However Ill repeat that for all of three alternative names we have a serious scholar reference
I think that it is good idea to add Apovci as a regional name of one of this community
If you have a relevant reference that the term Tatars has such status for Bulgarians as Pomaks Bulgarian Pomaks and Bulgarian Muslims for the object of this article we can discuss it We both know that the term Tatars for Bulgarians is only propaganda but if youll find reliable sources for other uses of this term we can examine them Until then the alternative name of the Macedonian Muslims and your analogy will remain incomparable
