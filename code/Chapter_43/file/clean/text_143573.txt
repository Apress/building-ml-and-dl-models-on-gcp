I thought the better of leaving the comment The delay after the fact was not the issue for me my offthecuff comment didnt make clear the issue and would have required more effort to clarify for no gain for either of us Its a little hard for me when someone who doesnt know the material makes edits that only confuse the discussion The source of the word in question was a Hebrew word נזיר dedicated which has the third letter YOD the source of the Greek iota in Ναζιραιος gives the English i Samson was a נזיר Nazirite and so on Too much effort and its point would have been lost I couldnt improve on the comment so I cut it I couldnt do anything about the history What should I have done once the comment was there I usually do a lot of editing my first comments often get changed  control
