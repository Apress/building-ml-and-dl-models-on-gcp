Thanks very much for the welcome message   
No problem  we always need more help here on Wikipedia Before you remove or swap any more images on aircraft articles you should probably have a read through WikipediaWikiProject_Aircraftpage_contentImages    
OK thanks for the pointer   
If you are going to be working on aircraft articles you may want to join us at WikipediaWikiProject Aircraft We have a very good group of editors there working to improve the existing articles and write many new ones each month We can always use more help   
Thanks Ill probably pass on that suggestion  not only am I constitutionally not much of a joiner but aircraft articles are just something I think I would work on in passing rather than as a concentration  My son is into Microsoft Flight Simulator so I come to aircraft articles in response to his questions and suggestionsIf it turns out that I wind up working on more of them than I expect to I will definitely reconsider your suggestion  Best

Your new try doesnt exhibit the spacing problem like before I still think the centering is less readable personally but I wont quibble over it  talk

 Pinewood Derby 

This is an article about the Boy Scouts of America In addition to standard style guides the official BSA style guide Language of Scouting is also used The name pinewood derby is in lower case except when referring to a specific event This is in line with other major style guides   talk 
Im not sure how the Boy Scouts style guide is relevant here as we are not a Boy Scot site  Pinewood Derby is clearly a proper name and proper names are generally capitalized  I think that takes precedence over the Boy Scouts style guideCan you point me to a discussion in which the consensus has been to use lower case in this instance Thanks   

 Please do not disrupt an article 

The Thong clothing article needs a lot of improvement anyways Let us not hinder the process by putting subsections in ungainly places and move the pictures about in in ways that disrupt the page layout
