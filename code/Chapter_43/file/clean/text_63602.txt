You absolutely do not come across as pious Thank you for your counsel At this point in this forum my request for ANI support made at the direction of DRN to resolve the questions brought here were ignored and reflexively and immediately turned into a different issue The decision to block was made outside of the procedures that I understand should take place engagement of the relevant editors inquiry debate mediation etc All the editors who agreed to mediate a solution on MEDCOM and the external review request and the Talk page of the article are being blocked All the months and months of abuse of process and people by the little cabal of editors at question are being allowed to continue As long as I remain blocked the question remains why Because of an investigation into the issues presented After careful inquiry After an attempt to connect to all the editors concerned These have not happened Instead I have been blocked on the testimony of two of the culpable parties about whom nothing again once more as usual has been done I am proud to be blocked It reminds me and others that there is a problem It also reminds me that I have more to do with my life then debate postgrads lost in the fervour of their selfrighteous belief in the perfection of their discipline Thats not you by the way Thanks for your support Good luck Dont give up Keep watching these pages
