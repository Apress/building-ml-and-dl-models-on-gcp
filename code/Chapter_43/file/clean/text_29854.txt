 Now to the questions
Psychiatric drugs  What this person means is mood stabilizers and antidepressants No what I mean is many psychiatric drugs that is many antidepressants mood stabilizers and antiseizure medications as well as most of antipsychotics anxiolytics and hypnotics And of course the psychostimulants are excluded

Second what should be used in this case NOT COMMONLY ASSOCIATED or DOES NOT CAUSE The difference is quite clear but since bupropion is actually used to counteract weight gain and sexual dysfunction one can quite safely reject such causality
