Nazirim

A revision was made after someone added information about Nazerites with a question in the comments of the edits

Potentially one could take the vow of becoming a Nazir upon themselves but could not be released from the vow so it would potentially be in effect the rest of their lives rather than a month  Then their child I guess could be a Nazerite child  Because no 3yo that I know of would really be born a Nazerite    Nazirim today are out of the scope of this article  Even Nazirim in the 16th century Id think would be out of the scope as well  The article is not on Jews and Hair but solely on the ceremony of upsherin

The same text might be valuable somewhere else but not here
