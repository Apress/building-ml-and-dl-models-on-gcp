New image problems 

You again uploaded several images with dubious copyright claims You said they were from Hindu newspaper and licensed under the GFDL What made you think The Hindu publishes images under the GFDL If you simply invented that license in order to have a way to upload the images here then please say so now so I can quickly delete them If not I expect you will provide proof within the next 7 days showing where and how that newspaper placed the images under that license If you do neither you will be blocked
