CANDY DAY TO SPREAD SWEETNESS SATURDAY

Stores Manufacturing on Premises Are to Give Souvenirs of product

Candy day will be celebrated throughout the United States on Saturday next The Confectioners and Ice Cream Manufacturers Protective Association announced yesterday that it has completed plans for popularizing the day in New York There are about 1800 candy stores in this city and about 550 are members of the association and manufacture most of the candy they sell

In every one of the members stores special displays will be arranged and each customer will receive souvenirs E A G Intemann Jr President of the association said Pa Ma and the kiddies will all be supplied with a piece of homemade candy mostly in the form of peppermint sticks There has been so much interest manifest among confectioners and such enthusiasm over candy day that the association has offered prizes for the best display of candy manufactured on the premises and for the most artistic piece of candy manufactured Mr Intemann said that the candy entered in the competition would in his opinion be masterpieces of the candymaking art

Let Candy Day be a time when everyone feels young again he said Everybody likes candy and we all want to make the day one of happiness for all a day to bring back the memory of the time when a pilgrimage to the candy store for a stick of peppermint or a hunk of molasses taffy was an event to be looked forward to I recall even now the childish pleasure I derived from a visit to the little store in our block and the pride with which I returned home attached to a stick of candy

I met a man the other day who said when he heard of Candy Day that it recalled just those things to his mind and he started out to see whether he could still find the particular kind of candy that used to delight him He did and so it is not so very farfetched to say that Candy Day will revive our youth

The association wants to see Candy Day firmly established and the public can rest assured that so far as this organization is concerned the day will not be made an excuse for gouging Prices will remain the same as on every other day What we do want however is to see every man woman and child enjoy candy on next Saturday

Although Candy Day was instituted in 1915 the confectioners made no effort to celebrate it This was because of the war and later because of the sugar situation Saturday Mr Intemann says will be New Yorks first real Candy Day
