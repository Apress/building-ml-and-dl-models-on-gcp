Theres only two citation needed tags left now Once is about the lyrics to songs on Lifes Rich Pageant I have citations for the sentence but I wonder if the material is better suited for the album page The other tag is for the release of Succumbs  which is something I dont think we need to cite but its up to you Beyond that its pretty much up to me to add more important information as I come upon it in my reading I will need help with the section covering 2003 and onwards because my sources dont cover that period most everything we need for that should be available online though Once were done adding information I think we need to restructure the History section divisions and then we can nominate the page for GA
