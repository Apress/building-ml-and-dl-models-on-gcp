Alright first of all sorry for my English it seems quite wierd as I do not speak English most of the time As a beginning I do not agree on my lack of contribution even I do not edit the texts I have the texts edited like this Moreover the Mason trio including MSJapan do not aswer my questions  and they have already arouse some discomfort amongst other editors  I may not know the wikipedian rules profoundly yet I know that this is not a personal forum site and no article page is closed to general criticism and brainstorming this is the reason why I got stuck with them  So they Blueboar MSJapan Docboat and the article about Freemasonary should be observed more closely This is not about Masons I personally have friends who have mason relatives but the point is the mode they create in Wikipedia it is not neutral at all
