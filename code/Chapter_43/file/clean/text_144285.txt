Brews hes given citations for the very things that I have been arguing about Polar coordinates in the inertial frame are the correct and standard way to analyze planetary orbital motion

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory I mentioned Goldsteins

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university

And in true schoolboy style anything that they cant understand must go to the trash can  0522
