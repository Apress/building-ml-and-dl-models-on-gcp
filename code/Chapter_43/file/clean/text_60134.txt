CONFLICT OF INTEREST  NEUTRAL POLICIES OF WIKIPEDIA

Dear Wikinews Wikipedia  since conflict of interest neutral is an important subject since conflict of interest is being herald by wikinews  wikipedia staff and volunteers including being used by wikipediawikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article story be deleted and is grounds for action against a contributor then please immediately provide documentation that editors administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create edit supervise andor contribute  For example did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia   This is a conflict of interest   Another example does any administrator editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including BlackPearl14 SVTCobra Chris Mann and Whoville own Disney stock have gone to any Disney theme park watch Disney movies andor buy Disney products   Then BlackPearl14 SVTCobra and Whoville and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits have any connection to these products places or businesses  Then this is a conflict of interest  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including BlackPearl14 SVTCobra and Whoville dont sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates    As documented volunteers including BlackPearl14 SVTCobra and Whoville together claim conflict of interest and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia and control it by upholding double standards  Thus first we must verify wikinews  wikipedia enforcement of their policy of conflict of interest and neutral

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors dont follow Wikinews own written polices Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy and that wiki does not write old news You even say one thing and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards and then make statements with which to justify it  Incredible you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends using double standards without following Wikinews and wikipedias own written polices and such 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors fans to be bias controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well and to write articles that are one sided promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause yet the editors delete anything that is added that they dont approve from other people and then justify reason after reason such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest not being neutral and such if they write or contribute  Its against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt dont delete and not to show respect when communicating  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control  If you dont abide by wikinews and wikipedias own written policies then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this  

PS Blackpearl14 Do you your friends and family or any contributors editors administrators or Mr Wales or their friends and family own stock within the Walt Disney Company  The Walt Disney Company page is not neutral it is a series of promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company   Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page dont follow your socalled neutral definition  Following your own claim of neutral the entire page would have to be deleted per your own standards  Furthermore the lawsuit sentence that was placed on it was exactly as the other statements of criticism within the Walt Disney Company page yet you claim its
