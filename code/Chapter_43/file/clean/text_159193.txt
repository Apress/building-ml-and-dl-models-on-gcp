This list is a work in progress The inline lists should indeed be moved off to their own pages for consistencys sake The various disambig page contents should be imported to the extent that they are initialisms and symbols however not all disambig entries are of this nature and disambig pages do not attempt exhaustiveness which is the hope of these lists I do think that large entries such as AA are best handled by simply sending the reader to the page See entry
