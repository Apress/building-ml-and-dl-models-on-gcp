Wikipedias Policy of Verifiability 

Hi there
You have repeatedly added unsourced material into this BLP article Wikipedias Policy of Verifiability stipulates 

All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged must include an inline citation that directly supports the material Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed Please remove contentious material about living people that is unsourced or poorly sourced immediately

Referring to another article for verifiability is thusly not permitted because of the inline citation requirement I have undone your addition because it contains an unverified claim performs exclusively that is not supported by any of the sources in the BLP article and in the article you are referring to in your edit summary Please add reliable sources to your edits before readding the content back to the BLP article Thank you 9313519127
