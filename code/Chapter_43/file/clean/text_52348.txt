Kent wrongly describes the Sathya Sai Baba movement in Malaysia as a Hindu Revitalization movement Whilst local Hindu practices have indeed been encouraged it would be wrong to use this term because Sai Baba has encouraged people of all religions to adhere to their own religions and has often quoted from the Bible and the Koran in his discourses Furthermore the official symbol of the Sai Baba organisation has the symbols of the five major world religions in each of the lotus petals so it is clear that it does not merely promote Hinduism
sources please for the word wrongly Even if there are sources this cannot be written down as fact I am aware that most or many devotees would disagree with Kent but Babb disagrees with the viewpoint of the devotees on  page 174 of Redemptive Encounters he writes that this cult is deeply and authentically Hindu
