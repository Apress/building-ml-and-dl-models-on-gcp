I agree Sadly even Pevsners heirs gave this mediocre architecture only a hurriedcursory glance and right up Missing two important things one a real buttress and some fenestration indicating 16th17th century original work and I suspect some 1st generation English Palladianism too It is clear to anyone with any practical knowledge of building and structural engineering that those pilasters best word I can think of for them are not buttresses  they are a decorative feature They are not high enough to be buttresses they do not protrude enough and they are in the wrong place for a strain to be occurring  especially just 20 years after the facade was originally completed They are clearly meant to complement the portico  which they do quite well There is some quite fascinating interesting architecture here and I fail to see why it cant be mentioned because some people never bothered or were deterred from looking for it    talk 

 Architect 

In hopes of identifying an architect I checked Colvin no listing for Tracy Park
