Non Treaty Chippewa Indians
I pity you white cowards I am going through this sick cowardly conspiracy only to have a coward intrude to stop the truth from being known You whites are so determined and proud to prove you are even bigger cowards I feel great sorrow for your race for you have not a bit of courage I strongly adivse you to be strong emotionally for it will improve your outlook on cooperating Go ahead and resort to the cowards way and delete my page Non Treaty Chippewa Indians

If an entity looking out for the future of Native Americans is involved i hope they kill you and those close to you in the most gruesome of manners Where is your courage Bring forth your courage by deleting my page Non Treaty Chippewa Indians That will prove you have the courage to accept the inevitable which will occur from conducting ones self in a crooked manner You do not get away with abusing power Those who abuse power always face a fate caused by their crooked actions You have no right intruding Intruders are criminals You know what happens to criminals who intrude Incredible numbers of innocent people end up killed
