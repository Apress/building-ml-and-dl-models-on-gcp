Thanks for that link showing that the new version is far far better sourced than the old to easily and properly support her meeting WPENTand WPANYBIO when the earlier essentially unsourced version did not Had this new version been the one looked at by Sandstein back in 2010 I do not think it would have been sent to AFD in the first place The last AFDs should have been sorry no consensus with the instructions that the thing needed proper sourcing as a BLP Toward the voters comments  THF makes no policybased argument PinkBull was incorrect to assert that she had not won any major awards and Benjar was incorrect to imply that someone could be notable ONLY IF the GNG is met  A pity that the 2010 AFD did not have greater participation and worse that I did not have the time back then to improve the article sufficiently so that those three might revisit to see their concerns addressed Just wanted to let you know that I think it might survive a return   MICHAEL Q
