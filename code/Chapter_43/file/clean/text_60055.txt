I do not think that this sentence Kansas was also at the center of Brown v Board of Education of Topeka a 1954 Supreme Court decision that banned racially segregated schools throughout the US belongs in a paragraph describing how progressive Kansas was  That sentence which is an important fact negates what is being claimed in that paragraph  It belongs in a paragraph dealing with how unprogressive Kansas is    Preceding unsigned comment added by 6810398200   

 Kansas City MSA 
The Kansas City MSA is NOT a part of the state of Kansas While some suburbs do spill into the state of Kansas Kansas Citians pride themselves as being culturally independent from the state of Kansas 60 percent of the MSA is located in Missouri the airport is in MO the tall buildings downtown is in MO the sports stadiums are in MO and overall the entire metro is anchored in Missouri It is the second largest MSA in Missouri and is not part of kansas really at all This needs to be deleted  Preceding unsigned comment added by 7024623123   

 The above comment was made by me I forgot to log in Kansas City is ANCHORED IN MISSOURI Actually Wichita has a larger MSA in the state of Kansas than Kansas City would even if you counted the numbers JoCo adds about 500 thousand and the dotte is about 100 thousand According to the article on Wichita there are 680000 in their metro Therefore Wichita is larger in terms of metro strictly in KS even though Kansas Citys MSA is four times larger Kansas City is a missouri metro not a Kansas one
