You have completey deleted any sign of Malcolm Bowden on the Creation Science Movement article without explaining why you have done this Further research has shown Malcolm Bowden has been referenced in three evolutionist books which can be found on Google Books  Clearly these are not WPSELFPUB
There were also three BBC references which mention both Bowden and Rosevear  Mentioning their beliefs position etc That is more than enough alone to be merged on the CSM article
