Archiving ANI report about Mardavich 

I wish you had NOT archived that I havent worked anything out with him his intimidation tactics havent been addressed not has his general level of incivility I wouldve liked a chance to say something about this and that I was more interested in actually SEEING admin action taken against him His false reporting is really getting irritating as his disgenuine im allowed to warn anyone i want whenever I want replies Finally as you yourself have been involved with the page and even in a minor content dispute with myself I think you probably shouldve made a statement and not used admin tools to archive it instead askign another admin to do so Thereve been a lot of those sort of should the admin shouldnt they lately Im not gonna burn you on it youre involved you can see a lot more of the related content than a random editor and probably felt better aware to decide I just wanted to let you know instead of grandstanding on ANI about it All this said if he does anything more in that incivil way of his Id appreciate you giving it more time to air and let more editors examine it and I hope youll be able and willing to support any warnign or blocks that are appropriate against him
