I never said a word about the primitive nature or otherwise of Americans during any period I do however realise that you are unable to see your own guilt and are stuck in a mire of pride This is a grievance and must be difficult for you Hopefully youll rectify the situation before it causes you greater damage in the real world  and since this article is such a shoddy work to begin with I think most interested readers will be convinced of the need for a real look at books on the subject and not be content with this page if youve spent over a year on it and this is all youve achieved Ill assume youve been very busy elsewhere My comments were provocative perhaps in relation to a specific colonial mentality  yours were of the lowest caliber and the fact you fail to acknowledge this at least publicly is a great shame
