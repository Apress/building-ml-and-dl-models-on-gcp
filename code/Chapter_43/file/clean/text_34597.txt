Rollback 

I have granted rollback rights to your account the reason for this is because after a review of some of your contributions I believe you can be trusted to use rollback correctly for its intended usage of reverting vandalism and that you will not abuse it by reverting goodfaith edits or to revertwar For information on rollback see WikipediaNew admin schoolRollback and WikipediaRollback feature If you do not want rollback just let me know and Ill remove it Good luck and thanks   

 Fantastic Thanks   talk  contrib 

 What are you doing 
You created a huge mess in the CFR article by deleting the paragraph that leads into the cite of the Kelleher case which results in a horribly confusing non sequitur Thats what was being discussed on the talk page Plus it sounds like you are unfamiliar with federal administrative law in which the plain English manuals are often more important for daytoday contact with federal agencies than the regulations or statutes unless one is dealing directly with agency lawyers Famous examples are the USPTOs MPEP IRSs IRM SSAs POMS and the CMS Online Manual System   

 Well then I suppose you can cite it right No Cant find a reliable source for your opinions and weasel words
 must be carefully drafted in highly technical language
 Unfortunately the vast majority of employees of the federal government are not lawyers
 it would ask too much to force them to directly read interpret and apply the convoluted content of the CFR
 very simple language that any layperson can follow

 I will try to repair any continuity error I caused in the articles prose That doesnt negate my reasons for removing your unreferenced text however Please work with me to repair the problem instead of name calling in edit summaries   talk  contrib 

 Ie and eg 
Never If that is the rule then please discuss it with our Manual of Style people so that rule will be observed more strictly than what our present guideline recommends   

 Alright I worded that too definitively I think I had confused the MOS comma may or may not be used with what I had learned in school no comma Although I personally dislike redundant punctuation I shant edit it in the future   talk  contrib
