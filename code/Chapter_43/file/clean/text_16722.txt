Expected by whom
 Sir Issaac Newton and the Law of Gravity wherein a bleeding heart opened by a 6mm plus diameter hole bleeds blood down onto the shooter below him who claimed Martin was over him when he shot him If this didnt happen then the shooter is lying about what happened  This descrepancy should be pointed out in this article in order to appear to be neutral about the matter reporting wise  Whats also missing is a photograph of Trayvon martins chest and shirt and amount of bloodletting  which should have been released as well  Where is it SPD  Coroners office    Also who said anything about tv special effects  Try and answer to what I wrote rather than respondong to your vivid imaginings  Youll be way more credible  Your argument that a 9mm wound had zero chance of bleeding at all is incredible but thanks for trying desparately to nonsensically support Zimmerman
