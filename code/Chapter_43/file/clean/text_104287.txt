About this Edit summary 

Becareful with what you say as an admin would get you blocked for not being civil on wikipedia i strongly urge you to look at WPCIVIL If you dont care I may go to an admin to report about you being uncivil Wikipedia thrives on reasonable dicussions and editing and cooperation between editiors which makes wikipedians feel like they can edit wikipedia without reciving stupid threats rudeness and namecalling These kind of incivility which you have done in the edit summary will come across to some as an threat or what not and will leave editing wikipedia for good
If an editor is being disruptive then just revert the edit without childlish rudeness and report it in the right place thank you and enjoy wikipedia
