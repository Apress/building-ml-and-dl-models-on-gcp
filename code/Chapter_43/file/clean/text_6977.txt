That is interesting about Batman I think it gets away with it because it was promoted in 2003 before the major FU crackdown The issue with fair use vs free images I see is that if there was the possibility of finding free images then we wouldnt be able to use any fair use images they would be deemed replacable what kind of free images were you thinking of The only thing I could think of is if we could find a free image of the panel at comiccon showing the castcrew That seems like a good addition to the article Im certainly open to any other ideas dust8212
