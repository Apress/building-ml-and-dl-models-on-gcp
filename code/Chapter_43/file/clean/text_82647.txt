PC game requirements again 

PC game requirements are all wrong No wonder since they were retrieved from mobygames which generates most of them automatically 

For example NFSIII does NOT run in Windows 2000XP only in windows 9598 compatibility mode Also whats the point of recommending Direct X 90 when no such thing was invented by then ROLF Any DirectX 60 is enough to run the game in full detail as long it has about 16Megs of memory
