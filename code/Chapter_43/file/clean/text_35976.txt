Unresolved sexual issues 

I find it unsettling that we censor reasons for suicide because we somehow find them personally offensive In striving to become a neutral encyclopedia filled with facts and free from personal bias we need to show restraint in our censoring We cant allow ourselves to think I find this or that reason for suicide offensive to me and therefor I will edit it as a rationalization to further a personal cause Suicide is a very tragic topic reasons are many for suicide our need to understand them not shy away from them is imperative if we want to prevent suicide I understand that homosexuality is a very touchy subject and in any way linking it to something taboo like suicide might be bothersome to some like Orpheus but we need to be honest here Unwanted homosexuality has been documented to be a reason for suicide and thus should be stated
