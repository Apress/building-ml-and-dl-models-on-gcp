I just put late 2010 as being the date until we get something more specific  By the way do we have any update on how Caroline Lloyd is  I know she wasnt actually named in the incident that happened but I managed to work out that it was likely to be her from the news reports saying the person slashing her wrists on set had been there over 10 years  When you look at that list shes the only one the others have been there nearer 10 minutes than 10 years lol  I hope shes ok and returns to Neighbours soon if thats possible
