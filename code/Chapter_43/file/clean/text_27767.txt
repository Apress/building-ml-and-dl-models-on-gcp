What Im getting at is that Speedy is the only person who was ever really in dispute about the mentionability of Mario Kart in the Sonic R article Please remember that while I have shown disagreement with calling the game a kart racer rather then a mascotbased racing game I never actually said the comparison didnt belong there entirely and while the sources certainly touch on the connection between Mario Kart and Sonic R albeit briefly and serve well enough to push Speedys proverbial nose in the facts they only serve that particular purpose as no one else really needed the proof to begin with making the links on that page feel in my humble opinion like cluttering up the page with unneeded external linkage In this case citing sources to prove Mario Karts notability in comparison to Sonic R could just as well have been done in relative privacy on the talk page without cluttering up the main article Again in my opinion at least
