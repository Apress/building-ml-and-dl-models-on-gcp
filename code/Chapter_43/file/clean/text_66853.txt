last post tonight Like I said earlier the section on Tornado needs to be discussed on this talk page and consensus gained on its wording as per example I gave above You have references for the other 49 locos in the table so add them to the table One compromise is to have Tornado in a separate table of one locomotive underneath the table of the original 49 class members Doing this would show that it is separate from the original locos but closely related to them I appreciate that all three of you have differing points of view but you all need to try to see things from the other persons point instead of wearing the blinkers of your own POV
