I am writing you because you have been disrupting wikipedia for the past week Im not sure if you even understand how your edits are disruptive so Ill try to explain Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV by removing certain articles from CategoryJesus while adding others to CategoryGod I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in CategoryJesus There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view Normally if you make an edit and someone else reverts it that means there is no consensus for your edit and therefore you shouldnt make it again Excessively readding controversial content is considered edit warring and you can be blocked for this see WP3RR What you need to do in these situations is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles that isnt how wikipedia works Ill also note that because of our NPOV policy I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus If you want to know more about wikipedia or if you want to discuss your changes feel free to ask me or request help from another user ThanksÂ talk
