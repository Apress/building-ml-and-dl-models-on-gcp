PBS  Why do you continue to insist the onus is on me to demonstrateprovide proof that the definition for the terms are different  You are suggesting a change here  The onus is on you to demostrateprove the terms are the same  
 I do understand your point  I do accept that often times military occupation and occupied territories are terms that go handinhand  My contention is that the nuances surrounding how the terms are used justify seperate pages  If you can find for me some source stating that all occupied territories involve military occupation and all military occupations create occupied territories Ill join your effort  However lacking this I think you will have to achieve consensus for your arguement that the pages ought to be merged
  Re Article 6 of GCIV  Again I think perhaps you are being a little to legalistic regarding your definitions  Remember that terms like Murderexecutionoccupied territorycrime against humanity have legal definitions and definitions in the popular psychi defined outside law  Starting from a legalistic definition is a good idea but we shouldnt be entirely focused on that definition  I think a useful way to go about looking at the popular psychi is by examining news articles and seeing how they treat the terms
 Shuki   Consensus on something that is not verifiable is simply the majority of seems to me  I think you realize that in discussing definitions of terminology WPV is often difficultimpossible  Furthermore Im simply stating the opinion that It seems to me the terms are different and asking PBS to verify otherwise I think the only option here will ultimately be to seek consensus 
 I guess Im interested really in the larger question which is when dealing with terms of this nature is there anyway of really arriving at definitions besides consensus I think not  I also think there a huge morass of pages  articles where we could have simliar disputes
