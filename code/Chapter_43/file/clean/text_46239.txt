Agreed with Malik although I am not myself AfricanAmerican The characteristic that defines African Americans is their being of African descent While it is true that their genetic makeup may include otherthanAfrican background that is at best irrelevant to their being African Americans Also unfortunately the statistic is itself basically a statistic regarding African Americans as a whole and cannot be seen as being necessarily indicative of any individual African Americans Putting such information which almost certainly is inaccurate for the majority of individual African Americans as most statistics are would itself very likely be misleading and seen as prejudicial and possibly provocative
