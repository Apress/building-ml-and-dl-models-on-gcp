Metasemiotics 

As a journal editor myself I often hear complaints from authors whose articles were rejected that the reviewer did not understand what we were writing The answer is simple this usually means that the article was not written intelligibly I have nothing against metasemiotics but an article that cannot be understood by the average reader will not be of much use to Wikipedia Honestly I could make head nor tail of that article Material published in my own journal could not be placed in Wikipedia without heavy editing either So my proposal for speedy deletion of your article is no reflection on the quality of the academic journals that you listed Its just a reflection of the fact that you did not succeed in conveying what metasemiotics is about in generally understandable words Apparently I was not the only one feeling this way as the article was deleted by an admin who apparently agreed with me I am not an admin and therefore cannot delete articles myself In any case it was only a speedy delete so nothing prevents you from trying again Please keep in mind in that case the public or which you are writing Happy editing
