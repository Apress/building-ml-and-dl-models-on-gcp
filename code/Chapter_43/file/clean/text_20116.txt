The info box says Education High school student  To me that reads as if to say Ethan Couch is presently a high school student  It does not say The educational level achieved by Ethan Couch is a high school level education  I think if we remove the word student it should be fine  Then the info box will say Education High school   That seems to be what was originally meant anyway I believe  Thanks
