There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same The neutrality policy which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them certainly requires nothing of the sort  look it up yourself I wont do your homework for you

 Moreover the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things No amount of slamming AFF  even if your charges are accurate which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted  can ever by itself make SF worth including SF must stand or fall on its own merits

There are many serious strikes against including SF none of which you have even tried to address First of all it borders on being a blog which is already an almostdecisive point against it there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isnt actually policy to do so as far as I know  certainly its a blog has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages including the same one were fighting over Equally importantly having read parts of SF though I do not myself agree with the characterization I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site To be blunt its largely the chronicle of one persons persecution complex As I said elsewhere it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in  it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content These three points  heck any two of them  are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia

And I havent even mentioned the most important reason yet Your site simply is not notable As far as I can honestly tell you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site If it was worth linking to someone other than the sites owner would have done so by now or at least spoken up in favour of such That last part at least is welldocumented Wikipedia policy look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you 

I am sorry  sort of  if some of this comes across as harsh Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack it is not intended as such and compared to some of the things youve posted about others including me its not even close to qualifying as one I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page
