I personally have noticed something at wikipedia and in the discussion which I would rather call british historical revisionism Im sorry but many Britons try to spin and squeeze facts and truthes Additionally they base their argumentation on statements like everyone knows German sources arent reliable etc and just quote British sources in contrast British sources have been proven to be wrong and propagandistic before too  but somehow this doesnt matter to those unbiased historians Thus things like bombing German civilians which was also described as crime by the British prime minister of that time and which can be called genocide if you refer to what Bomber Harris said is being justified like it is okay to kill civilians with bombs but it is a war crime if you do so with a gun by recent British revisionists historians The job of many British historians seems to be to improve Britains image by any mean
