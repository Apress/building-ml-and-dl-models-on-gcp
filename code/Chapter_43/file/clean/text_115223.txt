Im sorry for being wrong 

I didnt realize the Saffarids were Persians I thought they were other Iranian but not Persian I am truly sorry Im ashamed of getting the info wrong I just read the talk page and I cant believe Nasir Ghobar is going around claiming they were Arabs 

Wikipedia depresses me I went through many days and weeks cleaning up articles related to Iranian Uzbek Arab and Afghan history all of which were repeatedly vandalized to include false information by users with their own nationalistic agendas be they Arab nationalists Turkish nationalists you name it Not to mention repeatedly correcting information of various Arab tribes which kept getting vandalized by Arabs from rivaling tribes in order to include false history of a particular tribe that they hate etc And it keeps getting reverted over and over and over I give up Wikipedia is not a good tool for truth Im so ashamed for getting the info on the Saffarids wrong
