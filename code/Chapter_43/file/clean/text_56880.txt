Why ref to AP arch inscriptions and valuable historical books removed 

Dear Sitush

You have asked about the independence of Andhra Kshatriyas History by Pencommunitiesmatsa Krishnam Raju Kshatriya vamsa ratnamala
earlier in this talk page Its strange how you follow a different standard when it comes to Kammas page where you have vilified a caste book Kammavari charitra by KB Chowdary which is more of a Caste book rather an independent author as it is 
written by A kamma on Kamma caste
I may not be a full timed wiki author contributor like you but I do follow same rules for all wiki pages and communities my only concern is you have been following double standards in Kamma page may be its your community

Apart from Andhra Kshatriyas History book
you have also removed content which had AP archaelogical inscription sentences httpwwwwhatisindiacominscriptionssouth_indian_inscriptionsvolume10kakatiya_dynasty_1html and 
sentences from Pg 174 The History of Andhra Country Yashoda Devi

As you are the author for Kammas page plz be reminded that same rules apply for all pages if some caste book can be taken as referencecitation then can every other community can refer ther own community history books
I request you to be fair to other communities also

Hereby i am providing some valuable citations others will be followed soon
