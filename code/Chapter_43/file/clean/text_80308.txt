Firstly that is not a derogatory statement Please retract your implication as such that is a disservice to those suffering from such a terrible disease Also apparently the user Fences and Windows also found it amusing to locate my personal email somehow and is now accusing me of being a sock and radically discriminating against the Aspergers community Obviously against WPHarassment I also believe the user in question is in violation of WPCOI as my belief the Aspergers article should be merged is in no way discrimination and the mere mention of my viewpoint being discrimination brings up questions of possible involvement with the Aspergers community at large again fairly clearly a violation of WPCOI
