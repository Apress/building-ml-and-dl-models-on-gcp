Circumflex vs macron 

I keep coming across Tongan words spelled with circumflex accents over vowels Notably in translation tables in the English Wiktionary

I just want to check with experts here whether the circumflex was formerly an official way to denote a long vowel or whether the macron has always held this role with the circumflex just being used as an adhoc replacement due to macrons not being available on English typewriters and computer keyboards
