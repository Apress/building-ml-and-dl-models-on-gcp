First of all congratulations on the Good Article status  Nice work

Since you dont object I have added that section back to Little Boy  That action should not affect its good article status

Here is my reasoning  That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing which in turn was largely a public weapon effects demonstration  Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of say the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1700 tons of bombs

Hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target  The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects  Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender  The shock and awe was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb

Most of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima  It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured  Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets  In the many test explosions that followed large and small the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area

Granted it was pure happenstance that Little Boy and not Fat Man was used at Hiroshima but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here
