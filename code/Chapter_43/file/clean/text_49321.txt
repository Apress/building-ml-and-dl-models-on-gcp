Pris and Racheal are the same android 

Im afraid this is going to be quite a useless comment at the moment because I dont have the book in front of me to quote from

However I came to this Wikipedia article originally to see if it could help me decide whether Pris and Rosen are in fact the same android not just the same model  The article makes no mention whatsoever of something that has really been puzzling me

Why do I think that Racheal and Pris might be one and the same

 Pris originally introduces herself as Racheal Rosen when meeting JR Isidore and then changes her mind and calls herself Pris if Pris is simply using her name for cover how do she know her
 Deckard says that Racheal and Pris have the same eyes in fact the only difference he notes are clothes
 We hear no more from Racheal after Pris has been killed Im assuming there she killed the goat before she went over to the conapt building
 When Pris runs towards Deckard before she dies her last words are along the lines of For all we meant to each other  Surely they dont know each other at all Pris and Deckard have never met if she is someone else
  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it  ie she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the Andys
 Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model  It is only when she offers to kill it herself that she calms down  But then she would  she had just claimed to kill herself ie bluff Pris death or possibly commit suicide

Admittedly theres a couple of snags  If she is Racheal then she is working for the Rosen corporation so why is she hiding with the runaways  Unless she ran away from the corporation after Deckard originally tested her  

Anyway Id like to add something to the article  obviously nothing conclusive but just acknowledge the possibility  But if anyone would like to blow a huge smoking hole in my theory that I havent thought of then I wont and it would stop me putting more time into trying to figure this one out too which would be handy
