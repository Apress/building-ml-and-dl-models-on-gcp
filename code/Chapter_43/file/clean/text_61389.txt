Wow Gazimoff really neutered this article His edits from March removed half of the useful information here Itd been better if youd just left the typos in and NOT improved the article in your own special way

I wont bother fixing it For every 50 wellintended contributions to Wikipedia theres always a few editors who circumvent all the progress thatd been made with their own brand of political correctness Fags imo
