It seems to be your hobby to look around if someone post a link and finally declare it as spam Just my intention watching your last activities on Wikipedia
So lets face it  what is spam Did YOU read the rules of Wikipedia exactly We are currently talking about a blog which is exactly and only related and talking about the releavant topic It is not a member website or anything else Its not collecting member information or anything else Its talking about the same topic so why do you allow yourself to declare this blog as spam
