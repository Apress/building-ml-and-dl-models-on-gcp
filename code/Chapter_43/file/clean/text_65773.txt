Well yes and no The Munida page on WoRMS shows two identical taxa listed under Munida but doesnt explicitly say that theyre the same as the ones listed as genera in Munididae Indeed if that connection had been made they probably wouldnt be listed additionally as genera I realise thats a pretty fine distinction but it is important We all think theyre erroneous but we dont have a source to cite for that I doubt that Komai 2012 states that the two things listed on WoRMS are erroneous entries yet you claim Komai as a reference for that Were in danger of slipping back into original research here Id like to see Komais paper before I commit myself but I think the current wording will have to be changed I might add that the personal attack you made is plainly unhelpful Note also that the version you fixed is very different from the one at the centre of the dispute so boasting about how easy it was may not be warranted
