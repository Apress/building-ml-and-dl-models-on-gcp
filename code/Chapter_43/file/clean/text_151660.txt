Hair and skin problems from being in cholorinated water so much 

I remember reading years ago that Spitz incurred hair and skin problems from being in chlorinated water so much  Can somebody who knows something about this put a little blurb in the main article about this  Did this have something to do with his hanging up swimming for a while after winning his medals  I came here to read up on what problems swimmers incur because of being chlorinated water so much and found nothing  Thanks in advance
