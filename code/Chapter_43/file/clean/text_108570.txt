The gradual clampdown 

Is it really that fun to keep clamping down on me like that Whatever I do you will be ready to give me some dire warning and explain that what I did was so wrong You remind me of the time I got beat up by casino thugs

But come on wouldnt it be more expedient to just defeat me right now Im sure you have far more important enemies to deal with
