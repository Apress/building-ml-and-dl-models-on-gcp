Thanks for the suggestion 
Re Friends episodes articles
I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editors capitalized all the first letters of the titles  I totally agree with your point though I will take some time to format these correctly as well
As for the debate about having an article for each episode I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular summary format  As another example considering the legacy of Star Trek and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the net I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job Im even using the little nav table  I am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate whats already available out there
