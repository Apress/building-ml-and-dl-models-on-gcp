Thank you for proving my point 

Thank you for proving my point about how admins can criticize others but arent willing to take criticism themselves as you didhere Its really a shame that some admins like you and HJMitchell feel as though you are exempt from the rules of the site and that regardless of how abusive or outlandish your decisions are policy does not apply to you If it wasnt for admins like the two of you who refuse to see the long term damage you are doing to the project with your callous actions and lack of respect for other non admin editors Wikipedia would truly be a better place Now you will undoubtedly accuse me of being a sockpuppet of someone editor a troll a vandal or whatever you feel is necessary to diminish the fact that you sir are about as abusive as any admin on this site and if it werent for the abusiveness of you and other extremely poor admins on this site I would not have stopped editing 4 years ago Imagine how many edits and articles that could have been done by me and the countless others you have run off the site I take that back I forgot you dont care96255237170
