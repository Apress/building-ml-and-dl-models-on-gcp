Janet Devlin AfD 

Hi Anemone you recently zapped Janet Devlin singer converted it into a redirect which was subject to an ongoing AfD WikipediaArticles for deletionJanet Devlin singer Will you be closing the AfD too I realise you may not have been aware of the AfD because user Gsklubb had removed the AfD template an hour or so before your actions
I agree the article was premature but Im interested to know why you redirected the article before the outcome of an AfD Has it been subject to an AfD in the past
