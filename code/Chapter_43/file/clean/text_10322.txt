thats what Im proposing we split the content the difference is you want to split it by criticism and not criticism  a pov split and I want to split it by topic like history of linux linux products linux hardware etc  the content split is prefferable to a POV split since a pov split inevitably takes us away form NPOV   
 Nope  What youve proposed is a merger   talk  contribs
