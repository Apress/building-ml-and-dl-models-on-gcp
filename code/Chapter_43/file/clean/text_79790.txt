I wish I could clarify and relieve your doubts I do  At this point its no longer in my hands because editors on the talk page appear to have decided that DiPi actually is a reliable source even though it contradicts other reliable sources  I dont know exactly where it will go from here but it seems that the best solution will eventually be to use both wellsourced pronunciations in the information box  Either that or the present status quo will be kept  I dont know how it will turn out  And I thank you for responding and wish you well Â Paine
