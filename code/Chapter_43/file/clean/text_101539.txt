Arbitration enforcement action appeal by WookieInHeat

Procedural notes The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found in this 2010 ArbCom motion According to that motion a clear substantial and active consensus of uninvolved editors is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action To help determine any such consensus involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor or have taken part in disputes if any related to the contested enforcement action Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone see WPUNINVOLVED

Statement by WookieInHeat

Georgewilliamherberts reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of supporting terrorism from an absolutist POV nowhere in any edit was the word terrorism even mentioned my observation that nableezys political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezys support for terrorism my primary intention was to highlight nableezys possible WPCOI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed my main point here is that i find georges reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguousalso the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational nableezy a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack  whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length 48 hours for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a terrorism supporter not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack also i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of supporting terrorism not only did i never directly say this it was never even implied by my comments thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause and by association hamas  implying this was actually instead intended to say nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause and by association terrorism this is simply not the case and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at georges insinuation that i would arbitrarily class
