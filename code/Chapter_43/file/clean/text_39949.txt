Hi Thank you for adding a referencebut 

A recent addition of a reference is a good contribution however the editor that added it was correct it need not be cited although the excuse that there are enough is not the reason It is an undisputable fact one which is well known enough that an inline citation for the fact alone is not requiredit is douptful that it would be disputed Dating and any specific peice of information might require such just for varifiabilty but just stating that Ryan is the presumptive pick by Romney is not controversial Additional information would require further referencing if more detail is used Thanks Always to sides to any discussion
