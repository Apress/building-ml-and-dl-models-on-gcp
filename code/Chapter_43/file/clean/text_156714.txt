Inflated Britney Sales 

Someone is making up random numbers The person says that Britneys album sold 147 mill but Soundscan said it sold 105 mill and went 14x platinum We need to block him cos hes jacked up Britney sales I wouldnt be surprises if it stated that her debut sold 50 mill a few weeks from now
