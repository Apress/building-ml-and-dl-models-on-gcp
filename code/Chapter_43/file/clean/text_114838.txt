If you argue that Taiwan and Republic of China are interchangeable I invite you to show me an official document or any piece of legislation that says that In absence of such informatioin please refrain from making such editsPyl talk 
I think this was more of a cause of misunderstanding or miswording Perhaps it was due to the fact that I did not read the surrounding text closely enough before editing As an editor I know that ROC is commonly referred as Taiwan But speaking of this I believe it is a bit awakard to state something like President of French Republic which could be simplified as President of France to prevent confusion The image I was talking about was very questionable It states that ROC Taiwan claims territorial control over Mongolia etc Is this referring to the Peoples Republic of China PRC and ROC are two different things For now I am going to be on a selfimposed Wikibreak informal since I sometimes type different than what I think which can lead to misunderstanding
