re BUSY BEE GREENIE

With all due respect I think this is a bit over the top Of all the celebrities on Earth that someone would bother  to develop an exact verbatim copy of to falsely promote themselves BUSY BEE STARSKI from the early 1980s Come on So its more logical that in 2010 Greenie fraudulently hired someone to sound exactly like Busy Bee so that he could get a link on Busy Bees Wikipedia pagethan to believe Busy Bee actually recorded a track with Greenie I think the scales of justiceweights and measure are obvious here

But anyway Heres a VIDEO of Busy Bee listening to Greenie in the studio and saying hes gonna take out Eminem
of course you can probably say thats an elaborate lookalike personalityall as part of a fraudplan to pretend to be Busy Bee Starski

Really
