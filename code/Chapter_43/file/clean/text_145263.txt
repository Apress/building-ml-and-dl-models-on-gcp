Jared Israels claim that he fired GilWhite from TENC
After an email correspondance with Prof GilWhite himself about this claim I recieved the following response

Dear Ryan

In reply to your question concerning somebodys claim on my wiki page that
I was fired by Jared Israel from Emperors Clothes this is false I was
never fired by Jared Israel because I was nevery in his employ There was
never a contract that made Jared Israel my employer My work for Emperors
Clothes was volunteer work Jared Israel and I had some differences and I
quit Moreover since I was supporting Jared Israel and Emperors Clothes
financially at the time if anything it was I who employed Jared Israel I
have the email that I sent him in which I quit if Wikipedia needs to see
it But the whole thing seems rather irrelevant to me and I doubt that
every personal dispute a person has with another person needs to be on
Wikipedia

Best

Francisco GilWhite

I have therefore removed all mention of such a firing and I think it is best if the particular claims about Steven wise and the shoah etc be kept on the blog discussion pages they are on as they dont seem too relevant to this biographical page
