Hey there Ill be glad to clarify what I mean There are a few problems I have with the site and not in and of itself actually it looks pretty good and says the same things I would say First it appears to be a fansite which is not considered reliable enough for use as a source in Wikipedia This also includes for external links as the usual case for someone posting such a site here is to promote and drive traffic to it Second this type of information belongs in a travel guide which is something Wikipedia is not I would actually suggest this site for something like Wikitravel Again its not a bad site but its inappropriate here I would have no problem mentioning this site on the articles talk page and if consensus wants it in there then so be it

I do apologize for using the template as I do know the general guideline is dont use template warnings for regular contributors That said I do hope this makes my reasoning a bit clearer Please feel free to message me again if you have any questions or additional concerns Thank you for your contributions and Happy New Year  AU93
