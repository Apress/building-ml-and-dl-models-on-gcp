Im sorry about the urgency but as I explained it wasnt more urgent than removing my posts I agree with you about the wristband not being part of shiatsu and therefore that source is not valid for shiatsu and Im sorry to have included it However if we are going to be clear about words acupressure does not exist since the meaning of the word is needle pressure so unless you are pressing with needles the word is used incorrectly Almost everyone has agreed that the word is used for pressure on acupuncture points So I believe that when a source mentions acupressure massage it could be used for shiatsu since shiatsu in part at least presses acupuncture points
By the way it would be very pleasant if you checked all the other references in the article with the same scrutiny that you have done with mine
