Corroborating evidence is unclear and is in actually just another way of saying I dont want this information on the webpage because I am opposed to it As I stated before the information should be on the page particularly since it is biographical information that the person about whom the biography was written has stated publicly both in the Google Video and under testimony during Charles Calderons proposal of the porn tax bill before the California State Assembly I am not deleting any of your information but you are deleting mine If you dont approve of facts that have been stated by an individual  and they are biographical facts  then you may create an entire separate section on Lubben on this webpage Please refrain from deleting sources and citations Veritas Semper
