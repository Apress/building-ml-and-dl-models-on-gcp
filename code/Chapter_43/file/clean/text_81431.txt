All the of the sources that I can find on the desegregation orders in the parishes surrounding Baton Rouge seem to be 1969 three years after this school in its present form was brought into being  This source on page 5 shows East Feliciana where the school is located to have a desgregation order with a date of 1969  If it is a segregation academy the founders would have had to be able to see 3 years into the future  Also keeo in mind that the school claims lineage back to 1852 as shown on there official crest
