Re Photos for 1999 Sydney hailstorm 

Hi First of all great work with the article I do recall taking photos of my street covered with hails however I wasnt sure if that was in 1999 However these photos are of extremely poor quality taken with a phone camera back thenyou can imagine how poor quality it is Sorry Im unable to help Keep up with the great work  
No worries  if you know anyone who has photos please whack them over the head and get them to give them to you to upload  Cheers
