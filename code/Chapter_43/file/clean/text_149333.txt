Date of move for Beethovens and Schuberts final resting place 

Dear MagicPiano
In the 1863 edition of the British publication The Musical Standard the following paragraph is found on page 108 of the November issue It appears that this sets the move date of the bodies earlier than the 1888 year given in the article  Or perhaps there were two moves It doesnt seem likely

I have copied the paragraph digitized by The Google Book project and OCRd the image and then checked it for errors

MUSICAL SACRILEGEThe following paragraph has been going the round of the daily papers appearing in the Globe under the head of Court Intelligence The Musical Society of Vienna having resolved that the mortal remains of Beethoven and of Schubert should be placed in more suitable vaults the two bodies were exhumed on the 13th in the presence of a crowd of medical and artistic notabilities  The skeleton of Beethoven was almost perfect the bone of the temples alone being wanting The remains of Schubert had suffered much the head and hair were intact The bodies of the celebrated composers were photographed  upon being reburied
There is something essentially repulsive in the idea of disturbing the remains of Beethoven in the presence of a crowd of artistic nobodiesa proceeding not at all divested of culpably impertinent curiosity by the plea of reverence to the memory of the departed greatED
