Purdy and El Salvador
There is a contradiction in the wording of WPMOSFLAG Officially represented is emphasized in the section titled Biographical use However the section titled Use of flags for sportspeople says or has declared for a nation His sporting nationality will not be of any question on June 5 It really shouldnt be now according to what looks like pretty clear intent of the MoS so reverting is just wasting time
