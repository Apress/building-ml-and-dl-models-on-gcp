It does indeed look very awkward without images but the rules for WPNFC explicitely state that The use of nonfree media in lists galleries discographies and navigational and userinterface elements is usually unacceptable for failing the test for significance criterion 8 And right now I dont see any possibility of Madlax character list being a special case exempt from it  Of course other anime character lists do this all the time but the fact is it is against the guidelines And it may even cost the main article its featured status on which Ive spent almost year of hard work
Addressing your suggestion it is indeed possible to just revert the removal of the images but that wont deal with the source of the problem the unacceptability of such act under Wikipedia policies which in turn stems from the US fair use and copyright laws Unfortunately there is very little I can do about the latter so anyone whod remove the images again will be formally right AND it will eventually lead to an edit war which is an unconditionally bad development
Dont think that I dont understand your concern I too hate character lists without character portraits and a thought of my favourite anime series having one pains me to no end But its just the way Wikipedia is Being the most popular educational site on the web sadly comes with a price tag
