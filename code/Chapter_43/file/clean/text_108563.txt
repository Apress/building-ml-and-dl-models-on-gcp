Thirdly I wrote most not any If few mass killings were recognised as genocide that changes nothing every rule has exceptions And lastly Mengistu became a Communist by pure coincidence during the conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia both states tried to get a support from the USSR The Soviet leadership for unclear reason decided to support Ethiopia  and this barbaric regime suddenly became Communist whereas another one became antiCommunist In actuality I doubt any serious studies can confirm that that sudden conversion of Mengistu into Communism caused any increase of mass killings and similarly I doubt Somalia without Communists immediately became a democratic and humanistic state as you see this state is even more barbaric that Ethiopia
