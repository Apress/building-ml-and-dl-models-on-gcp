This logic is convoluted and general nonsense The arbitration decision involved a disagreement about content in the Khojaly tragedy article It did not involve a statement I had not yet made during the nonactionable enforcement request Therefore I did not violate the arbitration decision The wording on my talk page clearly states that I violated the arbitration decision where you said the following To enforce an arbitration decision You were not enforcing anything via the block but rather making a unilateral decision to disregard evidence I pointed to and block me for accusatory language I hope that makes my concern clearer
