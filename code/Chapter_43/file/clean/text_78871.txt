Ive just made another update adding more details I was too tired to add last time  The article is starting to come together and I plan to begin working on filling in the Winners tables with the 19791995 winners  Im still not really convinced the page even needs the Winners tables since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors if not more so and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years Dramatic Films Comedy Films ActionAdventure Films and then the splitting of categories into age groups etc It gets pretty convoluted so I think it might be a better idea to use the Winners section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete so Ill be working on that next  These notes Im leaving here on the talk page are primarily for the handful of editors who are watching this page since I know big changes and rewrites can make some watching editorsadmins nervous so Ill be taking this thread down in a week or so after Ive finished with the bulk of my work on the page and then probably start a thread to ask other editors if they have an opinion about whether we should keep the Best LeadSupporting ActorActress in Film tables
