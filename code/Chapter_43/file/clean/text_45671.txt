Hi Jarvey2  Looks like you had a hard time figuring out how to include references on your section at Ancient Egyptian medicinePharmacology  I may not know much about Wikipedia but I do know HTML and Wikipedias markup is somewhat similar  I was able to reformat your references to work properly  You may want to look over what Ive done and update your references based on my example  I noticed one of your Google Books references is missing a URL and I think the one you did have didnt quite go where you intended it to  At any rate this gives you something to go by for any future posts you may have  Thanks for your contribution
