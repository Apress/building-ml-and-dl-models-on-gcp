Well first I am going to address some basic stuff that will help you ion the future  Whenever you want to add a new topic to someones talk page either click on the  at the top of the page and then fill in the header or you can just add  your header  after clicking edit this page and then type your what you want under the header  This creates the header that you see which helps to keep convos organized and after the 3rd or 4th header your page will automatically have a table of contents which helps for organization  Secondly and most importantly whenever you add info to a talk page always sign under your statement  by either typing  or by clicking the little signature button in the edit toolbar this generates your signature and a timestamp which links to your user page  Now to address your concerns about the info into the article  The main thing here on Wikipedia is that we cannot have original research which means that information cannot be added unless there is a respectable source to back it up such as a website news article etc  Just because someone read it somewhere or saw it on TV doesnt mean it can or should be added to this encyclopedia  Also Wikipedia is trying to clean up its trivia sections because for the most part this type of information is not notable enough and it tends to be random  These trivia sections also tend to be just lists of random information which Wikipedia is not  I would recommend that you just let it go as more than likely in some time hopefully sooner than later all this trivia information will be removed or added into the articles  I hope you keep on editing though and try to make sure that you stay away from trivia and to always source your edits  Thanks
