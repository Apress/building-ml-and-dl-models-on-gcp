You also cant call The Cure or Siouxsie and The Banshees a gothic rock band because they reject the term Do you not understand my point They always refer to their music as dance music although they get called a indie rock band She Wants Revenges genre has been discussed on their wikipage numerous times that they ARE Darkwave Darkwave as a genre is not Industrial as it is today by itself it is New Wave Music with dark overtones for example see The Frozen Autumn or Pink Turns Blue The band takes huge influence from both new wave AND gothic rock as well as other genres but darkwave usually takes influence from other genres  so does Gothic rock Theres a huge difference If it wasnt for She Wants Revenges huge popularity there would be no doubt that She Wants Revenge is Darkwave Please respect the page as I know you may not be a fan  their true fans understand the music
