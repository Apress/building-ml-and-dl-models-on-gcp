My work was not marked as a potential infringment of copyright My work was reverted I am deeply offended by these actions I suppose that you can run this club the way that you want except I do not think you are running it according to your self professed rules I do not believe that you or the original reverter have any idea of who owns the copyright to the words which I added to Wikipedia and I am almost positive that you have no idea as to the details of Austrian Copyright law

All that I see is that work that I did work which the Museum thanked me for has been reverted And that after I corrected that ignorant reversion you reverted it again

So yay thanks Thanks for demonstrating the nature of the wikipedia process

No tagging the article that it is potentially infringing just revert it all

That is a stupid process which helps to destroy wikipedia
