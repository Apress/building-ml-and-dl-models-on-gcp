Nice additions to the instrument articles Rackett is sure a weird beast Ive played with one occasionally  I dont do double reeds but I had to toy with it anyway By the way when modifying entries like sackbutt you should check first to see if it automatically goes to sackbut as it does in which case theres not much reason to change the spelling considering how many spellings there are for sackbut I assume youre a doublereed player with a fondness for Renaissance horns
