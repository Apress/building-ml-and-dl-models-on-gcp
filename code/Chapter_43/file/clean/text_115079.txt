I think this is all rather scholastic The name is admittedly imperfect due to the fact that the article essentially catalogues very recent by the standards of any encyclopedia and ongoing events But the term could be justified the number 2 therein implies a clear reference to THE Cold War which evokes unmistakable associations the prime one being the rivalry exactly between Russia the USSR and the US for the global dominance to put it bluntly And not just some highly localised and geopolitically irrelevant unless you watch CNN claptrap on a daily basis squabble somewhere in the Near East Russia is the only state that not merely defies the US but challenges the entire status quo as established postCold War as is clear from Putins quotes cited in the Background section There is every sign that he is determined to achieve at least what the USSR had ie dominance over half of the Continental Europe or to go nuclear in a very literal sense of the term ie obliterating the centres of Western civilisation This is almost official now Thus at the end of the day Yes it is about the US vs the RF as the US is the only military force in NATO to speak of But the implications thereof are very broad the phenomenon is nascent therefore separate article is warranted I think We do not know as of now how it is to evolve it may very well be the case the appropriate title in a few months will be THE RUNUP TO WORLD WAR III
