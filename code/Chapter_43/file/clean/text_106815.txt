BullsBlackhawksRangers

Theres only one reason why Ive been inserting this into the Chicago Bulls article I do mention that the Blackhawks and Bulls were in their respective leagues finals in 1992 The only reason I mention the New York Rangers and the Knicks in 1994 is because Mike Keenan was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and was coach of the Rangers in 1994 During 1994 he was able to draw many parallels between the two dramas having had experiences in seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective leagues finals in the same year   talk 

Theres only one reason why I mention Mike Keenan about the Bulls in 1992 In 1994 when he coached the Rangers to the Stanley Cup the Knicks were in their finals Then he was able to draw from his many experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective leagues finals in the same year Phil Jackson was right about the Rangers Stanley Cup being a great part of a great chapter in New York sports history He knew that Keenan was experiencing what he experienced in Chicago two years before   talk 

The main source Im citing is Spring of 94 which aired in MSG Network as well as my own thoughts for all of this I followed both dramas in which both NBA and NHL teams from one city were in their respective leagues finals in the same year Chicago in 1992 New York in 1994 During the drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers made it to their respective leagues finals Keenan drew from all his experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective leagues finals in the same year that it was going to be a great chapter in a citys sports history He knew from his experiences in Chicago that the Rangers first Stanley Cup win in 54 years would be that You have to keep in mind that he was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and the Rangers in 1994   talk 

The only reason why I mention the Blackhawks in the article on Phil Jackson and the 1992 Blackhawks in every article associated with the 1992 Bulls is because the coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 Mike Keenan was able to draw from all his experiences from the BullsBlackhawks drama during the 1994 drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers were in their respective leagues finals that year Phil Jackson said the same thing   talk 

Houston Rockets

Theres only one reason why I mention the New York Rangers 32 win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in Houston Rockets articles I want to make clear that their win in Game 7 of the NBA Finals denied New York from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year as the Rockets defeated the Knicks 
I also try to make clear that both the Knicks and the Rockets got some inspiration from the Rangers win   talk 1940 2 March 2009 UTC
