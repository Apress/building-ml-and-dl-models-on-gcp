Article Cleanup 

For my own reference or anyone else should they happen to feel like taking a stab at it 
This was a version from early 08 which was very stublike concise but not very informative 
This is the first version where it was rearranged topically The catch is that all of the topical information is still historical 
The article should be examined from a modern perspective and revised under WikipediaWikiProject CitiesUS Guideline Take a look at examples from CategoryFAClass WikiProject Cities articles or even the recently delisted New York City
