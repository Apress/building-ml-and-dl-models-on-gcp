I have added block quotes wherever possible Incidentally in case you were wondering the reason the images of 844 Broadway are at the top is to visually convey the important fact that 844 was historically the most important of all the Wallacks Theatres As the text explains for a period of nearly twenty years it was widely regarded as the countrys preÃ«minent stage which is not true of the other three To put it another way if the article were about only one theatre it would be that one So I think its images deserve pride of place it makes a statement
