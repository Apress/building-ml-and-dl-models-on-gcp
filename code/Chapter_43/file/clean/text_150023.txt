fixed a number of errors 

There were a number of errors in the article where in spite of linking to articles whoever wrote it misquoted the article and published things that were quite simply false  I corrected them giving the article a more neutral and more accurate tone  You can see my changes in the history  There shouldnt be any need for more edits until the decision is made on 11 September unless we want to get more detailed 123222396
