Just added an external link  It is an article dealing with papers presented and interviews done at the first annual meeting of a professional society devoted to the scientifice study of psychopathy  I see above that someone thinks the article needs work and maybe this will help someone with a Masters or PhD in psychology correctly update this article to take more of the subjective and nonverifiable nonscientific material out of an important issue  I am not qualified to write an article as I have only a Bachelors in Psychology and I am all too used to wikipedia articles being changed so often as to render them near meaningless  But I will suggest that valuable appropriate external links are most valuable to the average reader who comes here looking for answers  This is the first time I have ever added anything to an article  or left a comment for that matter  Hope this is allowed as it seemed an good way to draw immediate attention to the new link   TD RTurner
