I didnt misrepresent you  I printed your exact full quote  So stop  I recheched the Aaliya reviews via Metacritic  Actually they were quite a bit less positive but became moreso in the wake of her death  You cant change things in hindsight much as wed like to  Generally Positive is the apt description of the reviews for this album  Certainly cant be highly positive when 14 top critics in Metacritic disagree with your opinion
