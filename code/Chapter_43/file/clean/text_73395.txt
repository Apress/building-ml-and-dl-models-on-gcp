AIG Loan  IQ
Should facts should be added about AIG loan in that the preceding days before this loan was arranged Timothy Geitner president of NY Fed had announced and published in NYC newspapers that he would not make this loan as AIG had been asking for a loan of 35  40 billion from the Fed Res for a week And that public request resulted in the Timonthy Geitner refusal to loan AIG anything

Then Geitner Paulson and Bernake were all 3 informed of the 100s of billions in mortgage insurance that AIG had issued and also the trillions in derivatives insurance that AIG had issued and informed of the further clear conclusions that 

without supporting the AIG loan and allowing AIG to fail this massive amount of market related insurance would cause a global market collapse This info did NOT come from AIG but from private party to these three Paulson Bernanke and Geitner who had no knowledge of AIGs importance to markets

And today making that AIG loan is credited with saving the global markets from collapse 

But that occurred as just explained and not from any knowledge of Bernanke Paulson or Geitner but from advice of outside party that reversed the already refusal by the Fed to loan AIG anything as announced publicly by Gietner So that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse  NOT Geitner Bernanke Paulson

This lack of market knowledge by all three  Paulson Geitner and Bernanke is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow US Treasury to dictate systemic risk decision when no one at the US Treasury other than saying those words  has shown any knowledge of markets to 
be able to determine what that is

IQ  Markets
In the IQ discussion in the article it is touted that the Bernanke has a higher IQ and that qualified
him for his job

Also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in Depression Era events

Neither worked to have Bernanke ACT appropriately in this global crisis which HE  Bernanke CAUSED
via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused THIS CRISIS

SO THAT with Bernankes Higher IQ  did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression

Demonizing Wall Street for US Government Caused Crisis
In the bubble all agree was caused by Greenspan and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by Fannie Mae  etc and by Congress this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis   NONE of which was caused by Wall Street

Then in the fight by Bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil  gold spikes his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which WAS a smaller part of the USA  15 trillion economy

NEXT massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by Paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers

ALL these events were NOT caused by Wall Street

Then Paulson Bernanke and later hugely OBAMA and Congress again and again bad mouthed again and again
Wall Street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by Wall Street when it was mainly caused by the US Governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but Congres and the pundits caused the US population to believe the lie it was Wall Streets fault due to GAMBLING

ALL distortion 100 

Destruction of Capital Formation and Wall Street
One of the key features of Bernankes job in oversight for the USA economy is in also protecting 
capital formation

And the engine of economic growth in the USA for 300 years has been the USA efficient capital distribution
to new ventures old ventures etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of Wall Street
publicly now and including esp the talking heads on CNN and esp CNBC has severely damaged that core 
of the reason for USA dominance and leadership for those 300 years

Added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by ALL of the US Government to Identify and prosecute
the huge fraudulent short selling of ALL major wall Street firms and major USA banks which was fraudulent
esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend
