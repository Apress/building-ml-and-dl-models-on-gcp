Opinoso you are clearly biased in editing Brazil information It has been documented how you have engaged in many editing wars like with Donado with anyone who disagrees with your perception of the ethnicity of Brazil You seem to want the ethnicity of Brazil to conform to your own ethnicity apparently Portuguese Italian and African and you seem to be fighting with an obsession any different ethnicities in Brazil than your own like the true number of German brazilians Please just stop editing on Brazil
