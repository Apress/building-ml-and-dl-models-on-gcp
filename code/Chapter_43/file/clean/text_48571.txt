 Pointofview pushing re augmentation 

The use of the loaded entirely positive word augmentation in this article is an obvious and blatant violation of Wikipedias neutral point of view policy  Like breast enhancement and aesthetic mammoplasty the phrase breast augmentation is a plastic surgery industry buzzword and constitutes clearly promotional spindoctoring  This article needs to use more neutral purely descriptive terminology like breast enlargement cosmetic mammoplasty voluntary mammoplasty etc without implying any value judgment pro or con and there are many with con views on this topic both male and female for a number of reasons ranging from medical and psychological to aesthetic and religious this article inappropriately minimizes this fact in favor of plastic surgery marketing     Talk ʕÕلōˀ  Contribs
