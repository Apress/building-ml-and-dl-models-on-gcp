Fair Use Image
Aplogies to the Total War franchise even though having had over a 100 from me they owe me an image or two  I wasnt aware of the rules until you gave me a heads up I was tempted to use one of the images from Wikimedia to replace it but to be honest Im not that fond of user pages that are more about the user than how they will work within Wikipedia  Id already removed most of the biofan material already  So no worries
