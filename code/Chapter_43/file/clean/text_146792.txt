Now now gentlemen I am assuming lets keep it civil There is no need to be so rude We are all aware of the several unrecognized tribes that claim to be Cherokee Until they are recognized by the United States federal government they are not considered legitimate tribes So if you have a reference of a newly recognized tribe then by all means add it Until then however it doesnt belong on wikipedia Thanks
