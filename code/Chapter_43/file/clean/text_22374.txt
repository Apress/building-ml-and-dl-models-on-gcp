Strelchick
  I got your message about Strelchick  When I made an article about him it was about 2 weeks before the election  It was only 2 sentences long  Then some NDPer added like 100 paragraphs too it  Dont worry Im a staunch liberal  I think it should be shortnened and then if nothing at all happens for about six months deleted  But not yet  Thanks

 Help with Vandalism 

Hey you seem like a fairly experienced user so I thought Id ask you for help  
Ive left him a warning message on his talk page You could list the incident on WPANI or if he reverts more than three times in 24 hours on WPAN3  

Strelchick redux

While its clear that the new editors behaviour is inappropriate Id be remiss if I didnt also suggest to you that you might want to be a bit more careful in the future not to get involved in discussions where you might be perceived as having a personal bias Whether you do or dont isnt even really the point  sometimes all thats necessary to spark this kind of ruckus is the perception that you have a vested interest They obviously believe that your nomination was politically motivated rather than based on a neutral assessment of Wikipedia policy

In future it might be best to just avoid putting yourself in a situation where your motivations might be questioned in this way You can always ask other editors or the Canadian notice board to review a situation if you think your motivations for proposing a course of action might be questioned
