Hello Stalwart hope this note finds you well From my angle I do not have any issue with you and I will like to keep it that way throughout my time on Wikipedia I noticed that you said I personally attacked you on the WP talkpage I am just curious to know where I made that attack the only strange word I used in addressing you was the adjective Fkg if I am not wrong fg is generally not regarded as an insult when accompanied with words that are not insults in most western nations and is used before most words my question is Do you regard the f word as an insult or did I make any other personal attack at you If you will not like to interact with me anymore on Wikipedia feel free to deleteignore this comment and I will respect your decision PS Please dont digress into my personal attack on another editor here I have gotten over that already and accepted the block in good faith because no one on Wikipedia fully knows all that is involved in that case and are just acting based on information on Wikipedia which is quite understandable besides it will be even be wrong to talk about that editor on your talk page however there is no legitimate excuse for personal attacks on Wikipedia Regards
