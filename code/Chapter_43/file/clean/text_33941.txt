It would need some references from reliable sources for that At the moment the body text which is wellreferenced does not seem to support this view so it would be odd and unreferenced to just put it in the lead in isolation For the moment please discuss it here and do not just revert to your preferred version  see WPBRD On BRD you or someone were Bold I Reverted and now we are Discussing it Thats how it is meant to go and leads to civilized collegiate editing I very much hope that we will hear from other editors on this topic To revert it again would not help the discussion and might start edging close to editwarring which would not be a great idea  Thanks and best wishes
