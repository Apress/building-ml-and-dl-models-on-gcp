As a submariner Im sure you are quite aware what over and out means
However your request is very polite and entirely reasonable so it would seem both very impolite and very unreasonable not to reply and hence I had intended to respond usefully
But Mr Beestra has taken on the role of divine retribution and dramatically interferred
I hope you wont be offended if I dont reply right now
In very brief summary I  had intended to say something to the effect that your knowledge in the area is thorough and reliable However your manner is somewhat abbrasive  in my personally admitted completely biassed opinion It aint what you do its the way that you do it
Any further response would almost certainly lead to me making comments about Mr Beestras objectivity so I wont continue
My closing comment would be Please keep up the good work but take off your hobnail boots and replace them with soft slippers
Best wishes
