Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human
Shocking news break  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me  A real 

person not a sock puppeteer  There are no socks and no puppets  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in unlike the editors who have no experience in the field whatsoever

It turns out or so we can surmise that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company  Oh no  

This cant be  Its a business not an encyclopedic fact  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world  otherwise why does it exist  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is blatant advertising  Yet other advertising companies like 

Modernista BBDO DDB Ogilvy etc are all here blatant advertising  So how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki  The answer there is no answer  Its all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business who call themselves Carbuncle Smeff Dongfart and the rest  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this  The very idea of limiting what is shown here censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily is against the very idea of a global Wiki  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias which have been 

around for hundreds of years do not or cannot include

To my mind and all the other sane normal people of the world this is all ridiculous  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest  It is a shortcut to thinking  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research  Everyone 

was rebuffed  What kind of person would do this what kind of person would sit in their little room hiding 

information from others and trying to keep reality away at any cost  Sock Puppets  Suspicious users  Legal 

threats  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always ALWAYS  asked for editor input and support

Go on look at the history  You will see that editor input was always taken at first despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject  When asked to explain themselves no one 

had the nous to do so  Delicious Carbuncle BlueBoy Todd1 Fisher Queen etc   All refused to answer for their 

actions  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense courage nor intelligence 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person as these editors have and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked is  not deserving of their powers  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia despite its noble origins is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence if you think you do face me like a real human talk discuss and the 

rest  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid sarcastic comment and run away hiding and never respond to 

your comments
