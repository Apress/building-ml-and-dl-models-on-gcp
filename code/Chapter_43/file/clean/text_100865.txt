It was just an example of another an apolitical use of the term There are others I just dont remember any specifically While I dont debate the inherent ties to rightwing politics the lack of a dictionary definition the popular usage of the term as well as the inherent ridiculousness of the word itself make it hard to relate to an one political affiliation exclusively But the main problem with the wording of the articles intro is that it doesnt specify the context of the political usage It says feminazi refers to feminists who are preceived as intolerant of conservative views which implies the word refers to any feminist who opposes any form of conservativism I think it should be limited to conservative views on gender roles or something along those lines The word would be used to refer to a feminist who was campaigning against fiscal conservativism or the War in Iraq unless there was some clear tie between these views and hisher views on gender equality 6985216191
