Yes I stated aboveIn fact in interviews West has said he has worked for Clinton and both Bushswhich I got from reliable sources vs his purported statements on Wikipedia which as you know have no standing here Hence why I redacted the term Republican strategist Im unsure how WPSYNTH applies here borderline or otherwise That is when an editorputs together multiple sources to reach a novel conclusion that is not in any of the sources That isnt happening here There are two sources which each independently put these facts together and draws the conclusion not the editors

I am not the author of this section but an editor working to resolve the undue problems which Im sure youve noticed weve taken steps to remedy and perceived POV problems I come with no sympathies per se  I dont see how this paragraph after I rewrote it reflects the authors bias It properly reflects the sources biases which is allowed on Wikipedia per WPNPOVAs the name suggests the neutral point of view is a point of view not the absence or elimination of viewpoints The neutral point of view policy is often misunderstood The acronym NPOV does not mean no points of view The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy by simply labeling it POV Labeling this section as having a POV problem is not a sufficient argument The criticism is attributed explicitly to those making said criticism which satisfies WPNPOV and WPV You may characterize the sources as minor but they are both reliable sources And you are correct they are clearly claiming her bias was the motivation for her mode of attack  but not the page editors

That said I agree that the section requires  additional viewpoints  for instance it should include reactions from the conservative side that said that Bidens attitude was wrong the interview was proper and that Wests affiliations should not be used to judge her This was addressed on the Larry King show Chris Mathews show and the Rush Limbaugh show among many others I can work on that but would like first to resolve this issue Thoughts Â cogitosum
