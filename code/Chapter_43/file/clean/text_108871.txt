Let me make this very clear an individual can have notability sufficient to be included in this article without having to meet the high bar of WikipediaNotability  The threshold for inclusion is WPV and WPRS  Your edit here is a misapplication of the Wikipedia policy on notability  That is my point  

I expect you and the other editors here to find a consensus on the list of alumni that should be included in the article  if the individual is of sufficient stature in thier field or in society to be named and they have published this information then the person should strongly considered for inclusion such as the individuals you removed in the diff above  I wouldnt advocate adding every Tom Dick and Harriet that went there but there should be a listing of some of the alumni  While I will be happy to mediate the issue I will not be engaging in this dispute over individual names
