There isnt really an easy way to do this I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types such as default parameter values so that certain data can be excluded I used to use Inkscape but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG codeit is sad to say since I support free software that I really appreciate Illustrator since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code Certainly Adobe authored the SVG specifications so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output in my opinion However when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format Illustrator will usually retain the sodipodi metadata which is specific only to that application and Inkscape I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding then reopensave in Illustrator Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file then reopensave in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata If this fails and it is a simple circle I redraw the object Often Ill name objects but remove Layer 1 since multiple layers are not needed for logos If you can find original artwork in PDF format and simply open it up in Illustrator and edit then save in SVG This way you can avoid doing too much tweaking to get around Inkscapes annoyances t
