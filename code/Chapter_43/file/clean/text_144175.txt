As for whitewashing well  I do trust documents not opinions And of course I would be glad if youd refer to some facts and examples rather than to generalizations as a matter of fact id does talk about 1991 opening of the Paneriai monument and press review in 19911992  not mentioning historiography at all google search did mislead you on this one 
Also you should note that the book notes change in the press and the recognition of the problem 
Also you should note that this books is 12 years out of a print and does not say a word about most recent research This also leads to assumption that information is more than 12 years old since a book is not written in a day  And Bubnys research is much more fresh in this respect because it is published in 2003
Well about bias and creation of myths we have to fight there is a good read In there you can find also a comprehensive list of most recent Lithuanian historiography achievements in Holocaust research
