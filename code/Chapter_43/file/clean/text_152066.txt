OIT does not say that PIEVedic this is what the bulk of naive Hindu patriots and I do not include Nobleeagle in their number do not get Elsts semireasonable OIT emerging model emerging being a way of saying that nobody believes in it yet would mean that the Mature IVC was the home of ProtoIndoIranian which isnt Vedic The Vedic period begins with the RV which would date to later than 1900 BC in both OIT and AIM models 
Nobleeagle yes I said I would be willing to present OIT as a reasonable alternative on similar footing as the Anatolian hypothesis which is itself  rather fringy and mainly advocated by a single scholar The solid mainstream consensus is that PIE has Kurgan origins in the widest sense which themselves may be open to a lot of varying interpretations Anatolian and a la limite Indian hypotheses may be mentioned in passing as minority views not as main contenders Xiaopo is perfectly right in his point about undue weight Since I know you are editing in good faith why dont we try to strike an agreement here instead of us having to follow you around scrutinizing your every edit an agreement along the lines that you are perfectly welcome to link to the full OIT article from all sorts of PIE topics but not to present it as anything like a main contender or widely held possibility  ·õè
