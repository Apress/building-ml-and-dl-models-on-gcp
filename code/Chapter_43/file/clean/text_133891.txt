Thanks for sharing the guidelines with me I decided to take out the part about Winters Tale but leave in the part about Noah Noah is an important project for Connellys career given that she hasnt appeared in a prominent role shes the lead actress in Noah in a film thats on widerelease for many years  its also a bigbudget studio film that sees her reunited with a director Aronofsky and star Crowe that worked with her in projects that proved pivotal to her career in the early 2000s Personally I feel those reasons are enough justification for leaving the reference to Noah in the leadin I have however taken out the reference to Winters Tale since it seemed like too much to dwell on that project given that it is on a smallerscale and her role appears to be more secondary
