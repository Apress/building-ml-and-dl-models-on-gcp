What counts as a reliable source

Articles should be based on reliable thirdparty published sources with a reputation for factchecking and accuracy Source material must have been published made available to the public in some form

According to these rules you pointed out the OFFICIAL broadcast of the Montreal Imapct v Houston Dynamo in the Disney Pro Soccer Classic  it is third party   it is from a source that has a reputation for factchecking and accuracy and it was made available to the public in some form  that form being live broadcast

there is no reason that squad numbers verified with the source of the OFFICIAL LEAGUE BROADCAST cannot be considered a reliable source by the very rules you quoted me  i will be making the update again based on these rules and that my source adheres to them directly  do not undo them again
