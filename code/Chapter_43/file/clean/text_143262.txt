No not without a lot more information Right now Im not even sure that he meets the general notablility guidelines  
I would disagree about the notability several articles two in leading daily newspapers seem to make him notable I looked it up DSO is level 2A DSC is 3A and excuse my ignorance a bar is a further commendation for courage and bravery and he got bar on both seemingly fulfilling  at the essay linked from the GNG for military people Just to note I am not finished with it yet I have a fair bit more to do Thanks ty007
