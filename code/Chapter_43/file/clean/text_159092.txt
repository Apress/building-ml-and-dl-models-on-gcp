why   

I do not understand the this article is no good banner or the low importance tag Perhaps it was written by someone close to the company but it does not grovel at the feet of Haas Automation The statements are accurate not overly adulatory not full of marketing hyperbole  in a word realistic What do you want  A statement by their competitors that they are worthless buffoons  

As far as low importance well  they may not be the largest machine tool builder in the world but they are certainly in the top few They are definitely the largest machine tool builder in the United States If that is not important but articles about some garage band that played a cover of Lemon Tree Very Pretty at Mitzis fifth birthday party merit indepth coverage well  what can I say   They make machines they make their own controls they have a decent reputation and a large market share and this article is unbiased I dont see the problem

I am not connected to Haas by the way
