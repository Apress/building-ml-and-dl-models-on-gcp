Since youre the one who is making a huge change to the article and you have been reverted by several users now maybe youre the one who should consider explaining your edits And the place to do it is on the articles talk page not here I will say you are likely to keep getting reverted if you continue to replace information that has a good variety of reliable sources with information sourced to a wordpress blog Selfpublished sources like blogs are not considered reliable And even if you had provided a reliable source you didnt explain why you deleted so much other sourced material I suggest you open up a discussion on the articles talk page if you have suggestions for improving the article Cheers
