Gren not in my whole talk did I ever mention that images are not allowed in Islam It is your prejudiced thought that is again forcing you to be conservative and narrowminded The whole purpose for me to take part in this dialogue is to present my ideas that the posting of the depiction is unfair    
    
 Hojimachong I would much rather be happy to get a quick response to my argument by removing the false depiction thus making Wikipedia more authentic and accurate  0822 18 February 2007 UTC   
 You aint fooling anyone     
 No sockpuppet accusations They do no good If you have some information to that end deal with it with check user or however you must  グレン    
 Checkuser instructs us not to bring forth obvious disruptive eg one who engages in personal attacks sockpuppets who are instead to be unceremoniously blocked Or do you disagree    
    
 If you would care to read the discussion that has been ongoing for over a month you would know that it isnt going to be removed because of the whims of one editor talkcon    
    
 I still am open for refuting that tirade against me Checkmeout talkcon    
    
 Since you seem not want to repost your rant on my talk page Ill respond here    
    
 Quoting me out of context isnt appropriate The very next sentence was I try hard to make Wikipedia be neutral and not give undue weight to any religion including Christianity   
this encyclopedia is operated by narrowminded individuals who least care about authenticity of the material posted on their website Considering the amount of time myself and other editors have spent on this page your blanket allegations I find extremely offensive though not as much of your allegation of me as a Christianradical editor   
I am sure that if you reanalyze the entire argument you would find that the reasoning presented by most people in this little discussion board is fair and a decision to remove the picture undistorted by emotion would finally be made For lack of a better word this seems like hypocrisy to me You ask me to review the arguments though you yourself demonstrate in your edits that you have not done this talkcon    
    
Do you even think I care about you as an individual being offended when you do not care about several others being offended by the FRADULENT information posted by your website My words could be offending to you in your understanding but for me it is the TRUTH And for Mr Gren you are the one who is falselyaccusing and forcing your own idealogies of images are not allowed in Islam to others If anyone needs to be labelled as sockpuppet it would be you And dear friends dont even bother to post a reply because guess what I have left the building and I am not interested in continuing dialogue because I dont see any fairness from your side There is a saying that You cant straighten a dogs tail by putting in a hose pipe and that perfectly applies to you because no matter how much reasoning and arguments are presented you would have your own preconceived ideas  Thank you and come again    
    
I couldnt agree more It is apparent that UserHojimacho has a closed mind and no matter how many arguments are presented to him he will stick to his opinions out of shear stubborness and ignorance Thanks
