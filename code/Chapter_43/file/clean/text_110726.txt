I regret that I couldnt disagree more with your implication that wars start out of the blue That YOU cannot discern a chainofevents leading to them is interesting but inconclusive and should not prevent any other editor from offering detail to the contrary That you dont think that the record would be distorted by focussing just on the war and not also providing the precursor events is obviously a POV I think otherwise but I am furthermore prepared and fully intend to to substantiate my think by providing full detail in support of my view and to see data offered to the contrary Selective memory or cherrypicking are not one of my favourite routes to a full historical appreciation  and I hope that I am correct in presuming that that is the objective of such a Wiki article and not a onesided surgical excision of anything that does not promote a favoured result
