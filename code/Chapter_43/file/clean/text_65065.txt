More on Second Amendment edit war Kenosis and Salty Boartr seems to be the same person 

Evidence that Kenosis and SaltyBoatr are the same person  if so  this more then meets the requirements of a 3RR violation and editing under multile IDs is a violation in and of itself Below is a message left for Kenosis left by myself and I find SaltyBoatr responding to it as if he is Kenosis Currently KenosisSaltyBoatr has filled in the gap between my question to the Kenosis ID and the response by SaltyBoatr ID with intent to hide the connection He probably noticed he responded under the wrong ID

What is this source Who wrote it It looks like a hodgepodge of blurbs about antifederalists in PA pulled from somewhere but Id be interested to know by whom and from where this stuff was culled As to the article text wrt the Pennsylvania minority presently it reads as follows

Another nonmilitary usage of the phrase is found in a oneman Pennsylvania minority report published after the ratifying convention cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs with selected quotation from the minority report

At least until this discrepancy is sorted out I would advocate changing the text of that passage to something like

 Another nonmilitary usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania antifederalist minority report published after the states constitutional convention followed by selected quotation from the minority report

Just to be cautious here Id recommend a citation to Uviller and Merkel and another WPRS representative of the position that the minority consisted of what was it twentysomething participantssigners whether they were in fact part of the convention or not  Kenosis talk 

Arent you capable of clicking on a link and LOOKING

I will be deleting all Uviller and Merker material once this article is unprotected as they engage in HISTORICAL REVISIONISM  forbidden by wiki policies  and SLANDER  also forbidden by wikipedia policies96237123191 talk 

I am capable of looking and I looked You are using primary sources and that isnt allowed per policy WPNOR We must use reliable third party published sources SaltyBoatr talk 

Per his talk page SaltyBoatd has engaged in constant low level edit wars for years and been punished a number of times If he is now using multiple IDs and it looks like he is to evade edit war and 3RR policies he should be permanently banned
