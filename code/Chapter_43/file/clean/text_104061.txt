Request for help 

I am an unregistered editor and I attempted to edit httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleCollege_tuition_in_the_United_Statesactionhistory where I see you have edited recently but Nasnema just now apparently vandalised the page and reverted my edits falsely claiming that I did not cite my sources I did cite my sources

I am a religious person who believes in God and I do not wish to cause unnecessary pain or trouble for Nasnema but also I must defend the truth and what is right It would appear that this user is valdalising this page  falsely claiming that I am which makes a good case that I should not join Wikipedia Could you please look into it Thank you7110140113
