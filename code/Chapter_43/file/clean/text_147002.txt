NPOV on peacetime Iraq section 

Several of these human shields had to be saved by US Marines after Iraqis threatened them for opposing the liberation of their country
Liberation Really Reads like it was sourced from the autobiography of someone fed on US propaganda justifying his shooting of Iraqis Invasion would be more NPOV but Im going to leave it up to others to consider this because I dont have a lot of wiki editing experience
