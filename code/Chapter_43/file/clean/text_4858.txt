The author of LotR clearly intended it to be a single book and it was sold as one concurrently with the threevolume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible  The utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books  This is in stark contrast with Rowlings books which have been published sequentially separated by years in between them and are considered by everyone including the author and publisher to be separate books entirely  I agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page  I hope we can put this matter to rest now  Thank you for your time
