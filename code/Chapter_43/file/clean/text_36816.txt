Yo Red Alert I know I was a tad slow in responding but didnt you see my 500word essey here TalkTerri_SchiavoMediationArchive_2F_reboot The exact link is here TalkTerri_SchiavoMediationsummaries and as if we didnt let loose enough there didnt you see the new section I created here TalkTerri_SchiavoMediationOther_Key_Points_YOUR_VOTE_IS_NEEDED_HERE 

Let me add that your ability to find POV errors SlimVirgin is not unlike NCdaves excellent skill For example when I first was asked how I thought of the page in the peer review or whatever they call it I said it was OK However after I got to looking at NCdaves criticisms and looked closer at the language and accuracy I not only found 500words but like Dave had to go aboveandbeyond with additional comments People like you and Dave and Ruch Limbaugh are my heroes for finding errors that are otherwise unnoticeable and Wagons not bad at this either though his findings seem typically to sway more to the center or liberal left in my opinion Therefore it is of high surprise that you couldnt find key issues either yourself or those weve identified A folder of 500word essays awaits you Likewise when Uncle Ed was my own role model and example on how to solve a dispute a method I successfully copied to be the great negotiator and put out World War III at the enWikiQuotesorg Abortion quotations weg page it was likewise a surprise that Uncle Ed fancied himself the failure at negotiations that had somewhat stalled TalkTerri_SchiavoMediationWell3F It has been 4 days since the last contribution to this Mediation Is everyone giving up or what I didnt feel particularly good about putting a user block on FuelWagon but does that change anything Uncle Eds only problems are having to deal with UNscreened employees editorwriters who are NOT paid employees quality is you get what you pay for and none of us far as I know are paid CONCLUSION You all are my role models and brighter than you may appear so scratch for answers and have a good time off while Uncle Ed takes a wiki vacation probably to work at a real paying job or rest up
