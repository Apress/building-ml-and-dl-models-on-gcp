Good for you Give yourself a pat on the back and proclaim yay me Im so smart I can do it Im glad to see such constructive work on your behalf Always nice to see editors developing a sense of selffulfillment from their work This sentence will be inappropriately placed but I feel that it is necessary you need to learn to read carefully before editing and you should try to control your tendency towards behaviours that most would label as idiotic No offense Just trying to offer constructive advice for your benefit and for the sake of other editors that will have to deal with you
