Fear has nothing to do with it  Your sources are poorlyresearched and biased themselves Arbcom actually stated in relation to a case that FreemasonryWatch was too fantastical  Yet you have your links listed as if they are completely true  Like most critics of Freemasonry you have a bad habit of taking things out of context  However if a Mason tells you youre wrong its Masonic bias and apparently because we dont want you to reveal some deep dark secret  I know perfectrly well that people love conspiracy theories so theres that to consider but my main concern is that it appears to be that you are attempting to wage some sort of personal crusade  Otherwise you wouldnt feel the need to publicize said material on your userpage  The sources you have were discussed at length and were shown to be inaccurate by objective evidence rather than personal opinion  There is a difference

Now lets look at it this way not being a Roman Catholic if I were to turn around and say that Roman Catholics are pagans because I could find instances where it was stated or claimed that Roman Catholics worship idols largely by picking and choosing my quotes out of context as I saw fit and tried to put it in an article do you think it would be fear on your part that would make you remove that information or rather the simple fact that as a Roman Catholic you know better and are aware that the statement is false   Or would that be Roman Catholic bias 

As for accuracy of sources socalled Masonic sources as fed through Ephesians FMW and other sites are inaccurate from a fundamental verifiability standpoint  I would be more than happy to discuss all these various materials so you can see what they really say but I just dont think theyre user page appropriate
