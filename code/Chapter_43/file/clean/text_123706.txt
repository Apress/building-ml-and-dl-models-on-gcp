New Picture of Ruiz on second base opening day 2011  is it necessary 

Is this picture really necessary There are a lot of pictures in that section already and in this one the subject Ruiz is very far away appears small with respect to the framing and its not even a very clear photograph Perhaps there is oversaturation with pictures in the article as a whole and this one is just more clutter than offering anything new to the reader
