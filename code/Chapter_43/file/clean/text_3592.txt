UFC AFDs 
Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so theres probably not a lot of point them existing  Im a bit pushed for time today so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles Ill delete the AfD pages when I get the chance   
I havent been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately  Looks like theyve been officially listed as AfDs  Ill leave them alone for now    

 Jake Bostwick 
Ive only nominated a few very obvious MMA people before  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied  To me he still fails WPMMANOT but Im in no way a MMA expert  What do you think   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasnt fought at the highest level of MMA as required by WPATHLETE or whatever the guideline is these days and WPMMANOT  If I had an interest in having the article removed I would AfD it again    

Hello It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion UCMMA is along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom 

Secondly after glancing over WPMMANOT and WPATHLETE I see that they are indeed guidelines Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me a guideline is optional when it comes to following it meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article 

Thirdly I have spent much time working on the page as well as being the creator of the page I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a typical mixed martial artists Wikipedia page as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability The very sources on him alone helps him pass WPGNG which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me however I fairness to you we havent exactly known each other for a while so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the pages position on Wikipedia now we can talk to help improve the page even more

Since you filed the SPI I wanted to update you that Ive reversed the block  I requested another editor to review the case and while there are a lot of coincidences he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation  I had some reservations going into the block but it seemed likely however I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case  I completely see why you reported it I did block after all so there is no question as to your faith here  Just wanted to update you   2    Join WER
