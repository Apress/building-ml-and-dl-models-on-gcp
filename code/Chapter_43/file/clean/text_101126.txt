Do remember that the martyrdoms which have the most lasting influence on Christian art from St Lawrence to St Catherine of Alexandria rank from dubious to evidencefree are there artistic traditions even of spurious martyrdoms of real people like Clement and his anchor To avoid the obvious Im not discussing the Crucifixion putting it under the head of persecutions of Christianity would be an original  although not unreasonable  synthesis This may belong in a section or subarticle on Roman Catholic culture but not history and I agree sourcing will be a bear  PMAnderson
