This article does not seem to have any actual theories and sociology of the history of science except for a brief mention of Kuhn at the end of it All of the current content should be scrapped as original research unless it is attributed to a particular scholarly opinion This page could be useful if it was an overview of various theories relating to the history of science ie Popper Feyerabend Kuhn Shapin Latour etc but at the moment it is highly questionable in its usefulness or encyclopedic nature  2325 31 Mar 2005 UTC
