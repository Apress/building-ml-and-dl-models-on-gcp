If you want a famous actress why not Olga Kurylenko She was born in Ukraine speaks perfect Ukrainian and more importantly says shes Ukrainian I would even say shes more famous than Jovovich or Kunis and  who are maybe better known in North America whereas Kurylenko is well known throughout the world Shes definitely better known than Vera Farmiga  As to Daria Werbowy not being well known I strongly disagree  Just to give some persepective Daria had 47 Vogue covers Gisele Budchen certainly the supermodel had 90 Cindy Crawford 50 covers was 6th on the Forbes list of top earning models of all time httpwwwforbescom20110505topearningmodels_slide_12html Maybe its a gender thing  Daria is definitely well known among females   0302 11 September
