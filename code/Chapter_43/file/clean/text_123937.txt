Hi  The original Land Of Confusion songvideo were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbeds cover version distorted readers analysis of the original songvideo For what its worth I personally dont even care for Genesis at all nor do I have any special fondness for this song video though the videos puppetry was fairly innovative in its day  But I  others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process  The article is much more fairly balanced now and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbeds version  So I have no regrets about how I edited it nor do I have a problem with what you added back since I think you added back a judicious amount though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit I only made that one edit to the article  had forgotten all about it until just now As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan 16th Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively  So you see the word count showing clear bias in favor of Disturbeds version over the original version is what motivated my pruning  I do welcome your further thoughts on this though since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video  they are a bit more highbrow than most numetal bands of today And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most since theirs did very well on the charts though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbeds version I would be in favor of that this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially

Best and good luck in the governors race
