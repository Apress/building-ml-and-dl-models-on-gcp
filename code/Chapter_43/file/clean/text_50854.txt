Unlicensed 

The two therapists who killed Candace Newmaker were both legally allowed to practice in Colorado  Connell Watkins had been an unlicensed psychotherapist registered with the State of Colorado which allowed her to practice which she had done for over fifteen years in Colorado  Julie Ponder was a marriage and family therapist in California and under reciprocity agreements was allowed to practice in Colorado  These are facts which came out in trial

It was part of the scandal of this case that the little girl was a killed during what was claimed to be psychotherapy and b killed by persons legally allowed to practice      Additionally part of the importance of the case was that these convictions were the first time that practicing therapists were criminally convicted for maltreatment during a therapy session where the criminality did not involve sexual misconduct

Thus it is both inaccurate and misses the point to qualify these therapists as unlicensed  While some mentalhealth practitioners would like to place Newmakers killers as outside the legal framework mentalhealth practice licensing but that is only their point of view and is not supported by the facts of the matter

I have accordingly improved the article to remove the words unlicensed as being wrong POV and misleading to Wiki readers
