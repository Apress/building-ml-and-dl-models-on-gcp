WikipediaWikiProject Red Link RecoveryCapitalisation1 

I see you have been working on WikipediaWikiProject Red Link RecoveryCapitalisation1 Please note that when you are able to fix a redlink on that page you should delete the entry for it entirely Only use the strikethrough notation when you find that the suggested replacement is incorrect For example if the suggestion was to replace Ice Cube with Ice cube not an actual example since both are bluelinks you would strike that out and put rapper vs frozen water
