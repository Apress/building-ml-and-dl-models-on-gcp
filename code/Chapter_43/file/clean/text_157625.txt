History  Recent Years  CWCC Paragraph 

This whole paragraph should be removed or at the very least reworked and probably moved to Tourism for several reasons
  The paragraph is proportionally way too long this article is on Cambodia not on an alleged scandal  of a local NGO
  It only offers one side of the story
  It uses few valid references most of them being articles from the same source stuffconz
  Right now it sounds like a friend of the NZ guy in this particular conflict between an alleged perpetrator and CWCC is taking a stand using Wikipedia which would totally inappropriate

What IMO needs to be done to make it acceptable into this article
  Describe the other side of the story too most of the time sex offender will pay the girls family to push them to change their version of the story sometimes accusing NGOs of forcing them into accusing the perpetrator
  Reduce the paragraph length defocus on one incident and make it more general if you cant then thats a good hint this should never have been included and move it to tourism section Do not pollute the rest of the article
  Include more reliable  diversified references again if you cant then thats another good hint of the inappropriateness of this paragraph

I will remove the paragraph and also other insertion in the article which I would rather label pollution Further discussion can take place here
