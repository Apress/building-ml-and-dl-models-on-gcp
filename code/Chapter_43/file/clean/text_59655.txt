No it is not reasonable to assume In fact virtually every mutant power has been completely missrepresented and changed in this movie series Further almost every facet of the characters lives have been changed in this movie series so just because something happens in one continuity doesnt mean it will happen in another Further the section is about his appearance in the movie not in the comic so any details from the comic are completely irrelevant for his character And using his comic book powers for reasons why the film makers would bring him back is an opinion His body is completely charaed Every character said he is dead The creators of the film have not gone on reccord saying he is coming back or hinting at it or anything of this nature The mentioning of his near deathes happened in the comicbook not in the movie This section is about his appearance in the movie therefore adding comic information in reference to his comic character is irrelevent Further CAPITALIZING your words does not porve anything and is completely silly Find a source that says he didnt die from the movie or the creators or anything Do not use comic books as an argument Although the films have basis in the comics the film makers only take what they want and have shown considerable creative license throughout this film to change stories as they see fit sebastian shaws origins and powers weakening of magneto by only showing his magnetic abilities making havok not be cyclopses younger brother changing mistiques origins changing azazels origins etc Therefore you can only talk about Darwins appearance in the movie as he appears in the movie His body is completely destroyed every character said he is dead The creators have said nothing about him being alive Find a source that says his powers follow like the books and he is alive then you have an argument Unless you have some other argument beyond the comics do not wast time arguing
