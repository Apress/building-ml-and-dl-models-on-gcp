Eid Mubarak
AllahuAkbar Allah is the greatest

These are the first words a Muslim child hears after entering this world 
The father makes the call to prayer in his or her ears as the welcometothisworld message 
The same call is heard wherever there are Muslims five times a day 
The prayers also begin with this pronouncement 
Certainly this is the emblem of the Islamic faith 
There is no power in the world equal to the power of the One God

Allah is the greatest

MAY ALLAH BLESS EVERY 1 OF US
AMEEN
                   عید مبارک
