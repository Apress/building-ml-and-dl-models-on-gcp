Can you start a new thread so I dont have to go back between both of you and point out whats wrong with your respective arguments Furthermore are you referring to paper audit trails counted only upon a recount or paper ballots that are actually counted  And for the billionth time not only is there no proof that any electronic election has been tampered with there cant be any evidence because electronic voting machines have little to none auditing mechanisms and serious security flaws  Thus there isnt any evidence that any electronic evidence was conducted without any manipulation  This is what paper trails help to accomplish and is far from a Democratic talking point its just common sense
