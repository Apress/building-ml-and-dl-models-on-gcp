But motorcycling advocacy IS A MEANINGLESS PHRASE

Who has the substantial authoritative support here TeddyPoo  A real biker corroborated by Google search results  Or a geek poser with delete privileges

I dont expect you to embarrass yourself and Wikipedia further by leaving this definition on line for very long geek boy  I just hope somebody with some common horse sense at Wikipedia realizes that defining nonterms deprecates the value all meanings of Wikipedia  And motorcycling advocacy is a phrase that means nothing more to American motorcyclists than say keegehtyddet kcuf

Replace this with your previous propaganda and you clarify an agenda you can count on us to expose
