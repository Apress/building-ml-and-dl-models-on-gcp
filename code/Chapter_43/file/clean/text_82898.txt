Totos Pizza House

Could you please help me I created the page Totos Pizza House and then moved it to UserPestbudaTotos Pizza House and on realising I used the wrong slash moved it to UserPestbudaTotos Pizza House Ive tried to move it to Totos Pizza House and have been told I cannot Could you please help me move it to just Totos Pizza House There are a lot of things I need to put on it but if it can be put on WP proper I think it will be OK Ive also put links which was a silly thing for me to do before creating the article

If you could help me Id be very appreciative or if you cannot suggest another administrator familiar with this problem which must have occurred before Thank you
