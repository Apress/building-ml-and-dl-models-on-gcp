POV issue 

This article does not tell about the laws that require boards of directors typical officers on a board typical educations experiences contacts etc of board members  There is also nothing about the history of the concept of boards of directors  Almost the entire article is devoted to pointing out the alleged shortcomings of boards and none of the statements have sources to verify them  Im tagging this article as POV until these issues are resolved
