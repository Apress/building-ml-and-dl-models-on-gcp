Regular disclaimer on vandal UserRovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a wellknown vandal UserRovoam who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkeyrelated entries such as NagornoKarabakh Caucasian Albania Artsakh Arran Azerbaijan Urartu Azerbaijan Azerbaijan disambiguation Turkey KuraAraxes culture Nakhichevan Safavids Karabakh Khojaly Khojaly massacre Stepanakert Khankendi Ganja city Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan History of Azerbaijan Azerbaijani language Azeri Caucasus History of Turkey Oghuz Turks Ottoman Empire Turks Turkic languages Turkic peoples Mannaeans and even TemplateEurope removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages including UserTabib UserTony Sidaways user page and talkpages User talkRdsmith4 User talkCryptoDerk  talkpages UserWeyes UserDante Alighieri UserChanting Fox

Since the person uses wide range of IPs it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking In the past hes been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP Thats why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages some of them more than once

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in NagornoKarabakh yet back in February 2005 His aggressive discussion behaviour unilateral unagreed changes to the entry and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors with myself being his major opponent 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under oneyear revert limitation and personal attack parole  However this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me for exposing him and proving him wrong 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous He is not the usual sort of vandal but is rather knowledgeable in what hes dealing with He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to UserTony Sidaway UserCodex Sinaiticus UserIsomorphic UserWho UserDbachmann the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions
