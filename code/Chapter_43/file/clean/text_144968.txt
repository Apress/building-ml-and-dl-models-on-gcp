Femur dimensions estimates when it comes to extrapolating to phylogenetically and morphologically disparate organisms are inherently inferior to volumetric ones of course a volumetric estimate is only as good as the model used and Greg Pauls are inaccurate this are his skeletals of Stan and Sue compare them to the ortographic images of the scanned skeletons from Hutchinson et al study available here and Scott Hartmans skeletals You find considerable scaling mistakes and conscious choices at articulated the bones that betray Pauls biases to making them as skinny as possible like the scapular blade being too high in the torso or the concave gastralia that Hutchinson et al already mentioned as inaccurate in their comments Using a more accurate reconstruction and following a similar method to Greg Paul Scott Hartman has estimated the mass of Sue at 84 metric tonnes Now for the article since theres no paper that explicitly calls out the 6 tonne estimates as improbably light for the largest individuals I dont feel like we can outright replace it maybe put up a range
