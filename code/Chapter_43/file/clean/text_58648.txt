Lets make one thing clear  I never agreed to anything with you  All I did was back off because as I said before when a 6year old keeps screaming for a cookie sometimes you just give them a cookie to shut them up  None of the changes I made violates any Wiki policy and youre the only one to ever dispute any of those changes I made which tells me you were just looking to pick fights more than trying to be a defender of all things Wiki  And while I was in the wrong for going overboard with threats make no mistakeI dont like you and will never like you  There is no consensus between us because your idea of consensus is brow beating me until I give up  And give me one good reason why I should let the SPI goyou did me wrongwhy should I allow people to do me wrong without some sort of repercussion  You seem to want a one sided relationship with me on Wikipediagive you everything while I get the finger  doesnt work that way  You want me to drop the SPI you drop the Gomer Pyle Citizens Arrest act every time I make an edit  As I said the only one to ever take issue with those edits on those pages is you which is why I honestly believe you just look to pick fights  Just as an experiment leave those pages the way I have them for the rest of the monthif someone else has an issue with them then Ill change it  If not than Ill know it was just you looking to pick a fight  Satisfy my curiosity and Ill never bring up the SPI again because I just need to know if I was wrong in making those edits or were you just trying to push my buttons  talk
