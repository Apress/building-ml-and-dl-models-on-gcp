MintPress News Editor Help 

Hi VQaker I noticed you are an editor that has worked on and commented on the page MintPress News The user sayerslle is insisting on attacking the website and citing adhominmen attacks to the editor as reliable sources While I have attempted to rationalize with that user and give a neutral perspective on the website the sayerslle user repeatedly undoes all changes Can you help users on this page reach a consensus You can read all my comments on the talk page Thanks in advance for your help
