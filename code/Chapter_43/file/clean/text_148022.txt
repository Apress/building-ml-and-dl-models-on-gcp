importance 

In general articles are placed into Top importance if they are referenced as see also in the main article as they are as it were the effective second articles on the subject that someone looking for information would see All those articles which I had marked as Top are referenced in such a way in the main Intelligent design article I do note that the project at present doesnt have the same phrasing for determining assessments as some of the other projects Ive noted in the past that WikipediaWikiProject Germany has among the most easily understood ways of determining assessment in their importance scale and basically follow its guidelines even for other projects at least in regard to the main subarticles of the main article itself I was actually thinking of trying to adjust those ratings to fit more easily for the id project but am having some trouble with phrasing it If of course you believe that the articles do not deserve such priority feel free to adjust them I make mistakes more often than I really like to admit
