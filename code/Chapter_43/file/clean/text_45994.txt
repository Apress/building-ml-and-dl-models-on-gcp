A little I was overlooking the work somebody was doing on that state a while back and started a few articles on rivers etc and sorting out Kannada film lists etc At present thought Im involved in a discussion at the Indian noticeboard about a bot to get all of the missing Indian village articles onto wikipedia if youd like to join in the discussion Just surprised that the healthcare articles wasnt covered seems as Karnataka seems to have them especially detailed focused articles like Wildife etc  White cat
