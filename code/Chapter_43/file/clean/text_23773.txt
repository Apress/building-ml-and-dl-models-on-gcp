Diabetes    I have received Haldol for 30 years and recently have come down with Diabetes
Initialy I recieved Haldol suposotories at a County Hospital to calm me down After the initial dose
did not stop my from screaming and complaining about my treatment at the hands of the hospital workers another dose was administered Haldol does nothing it proports to do I can think logically
when I want to and I can have sureal imaginations whenever If it bugs you too bad The Haldol does not stop me from being illogicall and as creative as I wish Psychobable is a very dumb language to
me and I get angry at having to speak it to shrinks I wish these professionals would find a more
usefull way to contribute to society other than trying to modify other peoples different behavior
