Thanks  for your much appreciated participation  I respect your opposition and obviously disagree respectfully I feel very strongly about this as Maron just does not sound right مارون is pronounced Maroun and I hope Arab speaking editors can confirm the Maroun pronunciation Also Maronites in Lebanon and Syria all know him as Mar Maroun not Maroun nor Maron For the record Mar Maroun means Saint Maroun and he is a Saint  Most importantly he was a Syrian monk who lived in Lebanon and is a Lebanese Saint not a Greek Saint  Whatever compromise and consensus we all reach is fine with me
