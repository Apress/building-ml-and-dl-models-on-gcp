Gracias por mejorar el artículo de Casapueblo que increiblemente no estaba en wikipedia Yo que no soy uruguayo  creo que este lugar es uno de los más mágicos en el mundo

WPFU violation

Your recent edit to Aishwarya Rai has been reverted  We are not permitted to use fairuse images to depict living people  Additionally you did not add the mandatory detailed fairuse rationale justifying the use of that image  Please see WPFU which explains this policy  Thanks   
 My apologies  since the image was used on the film page for Bride and Prejudice I thought it was within fair use Thanks for the information   
Also please note that it was the original poster of the image who did not add the mandatory detailed fairuse rationale justifying the use of that image

Thanks for your good words here  I do appreciate the feedback particularly the clarification about fair use as I wasnt aware of what you wrote above  I certainly will follow these proceedures in the fu
