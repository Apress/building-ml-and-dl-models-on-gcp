The problem is the wider we cast the net in terms of subject matter for the article the more room there is for disagreement and debate  Energies are dispersed and the article becomes lopsided and uneven  Read the article on Human skin color  This article discusses the various theories about human skin color  One scenario is that fair skin is the result of spontaneous random mutation that theoretically there were whiteskinned people the result of genetic mutations in Africa but they simply did not survive to produce progeny that the same mutations occurred when humans migrated north but because of the climate those mutants survived to bear and rear offspring  Another scenario posits that humans initially were pale like simians but as they began to lose their hair their skin darkened over time as a climatic accommodation  And there are other theories as well  You want to get into melanin in this article  and the accompanying sturm und drang of agrument disagreement and potentially more edit warring just look at whats happened here with a far narrower piece  and for material that eventually will be cut out anyway  The mechanics of melanin  This still reads like a phenomenally bad idea
