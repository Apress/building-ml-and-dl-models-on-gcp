This is very similar to what I have so far discovered  I have  traced the Cathars back through the Paulicians and back further to the Antiochan Church  Also I have discovered their connection with the Ebionites which  had a lineage to the Essenes  The link you provided is unfortunately not in English  Is there a site in English or a web page somewhere describing Gadels theories   This is too important to leave hanging on an unreadable web page  Please give us more information  Thank you    CoWinn
