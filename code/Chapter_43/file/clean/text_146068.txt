Numbers as figures or words 

Somehow I had the idea that the division between using the numerical version and spelling out a number was 9ten However reading WikipediaManual_of_StyleNumbers_as_figures_or_words I do not see more than a suggestion regarding this Further it says nothing about consistency in the article eg if spelling out numbers over ten then do so consistently unless there is a reason to do otherwise  Could you straighten out my thinking on this issue Thanks   Talk
