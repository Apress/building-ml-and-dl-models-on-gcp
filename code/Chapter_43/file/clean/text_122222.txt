I guess that ɑɾɹ for otter is a misprint in the source and should read ɑɾɹ Evidence for this is that where Silverman describes the normal outcome of tapping with distinction marked by length contrast on the preceding vowel we read ˈVtV  ˈVɾV Silverman 2004 p 87 Also this is consistent with how the length contrast on the preceding vowel is marked in other surroundings eg in the cited table in knot

With regard to nod I think there is nothing wrong It is pretty much the point of Silvermans article that in this particular position devoicing is common Of course additional sources would be nice
