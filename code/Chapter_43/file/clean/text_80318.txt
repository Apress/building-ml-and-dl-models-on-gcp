POV Yahweh Vocalization Sidenote 

Hello Cush Just replied to your latest reply to me in the TalkYahweh page and I wanted to add a personal sidenote to that I dont think we actually disagree on what I was saying I may just not be explaining my thought clearly enough I have generally noted that you and PiCo are  for the most part  on the same page as I am on cleaning up the Y article

Now that we have finally removed the behemoth sections about the vocalization that use to be in the article I want to be vigilant about making sure all that does not creep back in That discussion should instead go to the Tetran article and that any discussion about the vocalization that remains within the Y article be kept to a absolute minimum only present where really necessary not going into much detail about it and that it be neutral about that discussion if people want to know more about it they can go to the Tetran article for it

Thats a basic summary and I get the feeling that you agree with these thoughts
