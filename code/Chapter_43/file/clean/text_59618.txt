Re Tracker business software 

Hello thanks for your comments on my talk page  You mention that the article was already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary but I guess I didnt do a good enough job  I read through the AFD the DRV and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on  AFDDRV were able to determine the notability of the article but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in its past state the article wasnt much more than a product sheet which to me is synonymous with advertising  Wikipedia articles arent about features lists or product offerings they are about bringing together neutral thirdpartyverified information about topics  As Im sure youve seen I rearranged the page a little more since  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names  descriptions so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia  Also this is minor but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor I am also an admin but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many thirdparty sources listed  The article is very well sourced but not very much of that information is brought into the article

As for the List of project management software with such a relatively short list it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products  I dont know a way would satisfy your concern other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit In the future it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the webbased products but not while there is only enough information for one article  Again please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia see What Wikipedia is not which is to bring neutral information not advertising or promoting
