 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack They will readily engage in debates but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts For example a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsessions rivals Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudointellectual Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts As a result a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as fanboys Within this group more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard resulting in a more outgoing attitude even among those with insecurities This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex

The term fangirl while similar often carries slightly different connotations The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan regardless of obsessive qualities or not and is often used with overtones of teenybopper
