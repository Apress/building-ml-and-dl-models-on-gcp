Thanks for the note Richard I knew it was a road bridge but it is called the Turnbridge Loco Lift Bridge in every reference I can find Nicholson Waterways guide Kirkless MBC website Waterscapecom etc and the name seems to stem from its shape rather than its function I have added a link from the map to your excellent photo
