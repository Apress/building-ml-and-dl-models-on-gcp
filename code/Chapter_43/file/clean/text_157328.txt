It is very suspicious that you claim to be an expert but you are unable to provide any excerpt or specific citation supporting your claim that Dr Exners work calls the interpretations here incorrect For starters the Exner system of scoring article cites three works not one as the whole book implies  More importantly anyone with the firsthand expertise you have should easily be able to provide a specific excerpt for your claim  But most importantly it seems extremely unlikely to me that you would be able to find any source from 2002 or earlier which claims that specific interpretations made in the 2007 external link are incorrect on a projective evaluation for which several easily googleable apparently reliable sources say there are no wrong answers  Consider if an answer suggests a personality problem which the examiner is screening for how can it be incorrect as it is furthering the objectives of the test
To answer your question I have absolutely no expertise with the Rorschach test However I am certain that I can understand the plain language of Wikipedia rules as well as you They include
any material challenged or likely to be challenged should be attributed to a reliable published source using an inline citation The source should be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question Certain red flags should prompt editors to examine the sources for a given claim including surprising  claims that are not widely known The requirement to provide carefully selected qualitative sources for exceptional claims especially applies in the context of scientific or medical topics  WPV emphasis added
conflict of interest edits are strongly discouraged Adding material that appears to promote the interests or visibility of an articles author  employer associates or his business or personal interests places the author in a conflict of interest If other editors suggest that your editing violates Wikipedias standards take that advice seriously and consider stepping back reassessing your edits and discussing your intentions with the community In particular consider whether you are editing tendentiously  WPCOI emphasis added 
The fact that you found it necessary to use all caps in an edit summary suggests to me that you are emotionally involved with this subject which clearly represents a large portion of your lifes work  Since you cited the entirety of some undefined book instead of providing a specific page numbers per WikipediaCiting sourcesSay where you got it I can not assume enough good faith to bring myself to believe that you are not be conflicted here
I must renew my request for the specific excerpts or exact citations supporting your claim that the external link contains incorrect interpretations and I will be reverting the edit suggesting that it does in accordance with the foundational WPV  Thank you
