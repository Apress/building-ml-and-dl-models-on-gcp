Redirection of Chris Conley 
Sorry to bother you again on your wikibreak but it seems that the dispute over the redirection of Chris Conley still has not been resolved It seems that while I was blocked  has redirected the article Comments were left in regards to the redirect on the page Saves the Day and another editor has reverted the article which  has redirected again citing sockpuppetry and COI but failing to leave any kind of comment on the relevant discussion pages As I was blocked from editing I fail to understand how this could be the case and a quick WHOIS search shows that the editing IPs come from manchester UK and somewhere in Australia So it appears that an edit war is still continuing Rather than participate further in this and get blocked again I thought was best to leave you a note here
FYI the main reason why I redirected the article in the first place is because Chris Conley is also a successful touring solo artist a quick google search can confirm this and hence notable enough to warrent his own article I also find it interesting that a number of other editors have contributed to the article after I undid the original redirect on July 28  Thanks and sorry again for dragging you outof your wikibreak
