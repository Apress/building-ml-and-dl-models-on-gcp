To my knowledge Wikipedia does not have a policy against newspaper articles as sources I dont see any legitimacy behind your claim that the paragraph has been given undue weight its a short paragraph in a nonprominent position The bullying is being done by unidentified IPs who persit in deleting mass portions of text and refusing to engage in any proper discussion for months on end
