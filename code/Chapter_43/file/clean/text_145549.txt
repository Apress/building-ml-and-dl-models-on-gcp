Travel advice 

Hi AL
I hope you dont think Im being cheeky but I would appreciate your advice My wife and I are currently in southern France and will shortly be heading off in our campervan to visit northern Spain hoping to get to the far northwest On checking our time schedule we find that we have a week extra so are thinking of visiting northern Portugal although we are unlikely to get further south than Porto As we have no travel guides to Portugal can you recommend any places to visit 
Thanks for any advice 
Best wishes
