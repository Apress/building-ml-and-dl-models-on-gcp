I appreciate that some people very strongly wish to maintain this fantasy but that map shows regions as part of Serbia which are not actually part of Serbia Please stop misleading readers If you want a second map further down which represents some hypothetical Serbian geography ie your interpretation of the constitution rather than actual Serbian geography then I could accept that as a compromise but we must stop misleading readers The map is not the only problem I would point out that the lede says

This is blatantly false Kosovo declared independence years ago   
I already added the note Anastan Bobryner feel free to read TemplateKosovonote which says Kosovo note was created with reference to the main wikipedia guidelines like WikipediaNPOV and WikipediaNaming conventions    
And what can be wrong here Serbia officially have Kosovo as part of its territory Its not hypothetical or interpretation of the constitution you go and read it your self now 

Considering also that the Province of Kosovo and Metohija is an integral part of the territory of Serbia  Constitution of the Republic of Serbia

So we must use this map as this is official and its not fantasy We all knaw that republika of Kosovo exist but serbia official status is the same so must use it until it is like that  ταlκ
