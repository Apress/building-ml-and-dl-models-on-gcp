But Wikipedia is wisdom of the crowd See this aricle 
For Kendall Whitehouse senior director of information technology at Wharton the most interesting question is whether the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately a better approach compared to scholarly review and edited content As Whitehouse observes Wikipedias strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information Joel Waldfogel professor of business and public policy agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media printed encyclopedias in this case stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media quoted from article In short no matter what system you come up with here it is going to be wisdom of the crowd by design that is what Wiki is So you might as well design a system around that concept go with the natural design of the system work with it to all its advantages not work against it and try to limit it with old media concepts
