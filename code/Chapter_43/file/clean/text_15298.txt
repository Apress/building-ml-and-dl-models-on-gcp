Jeraphine looks like you were right It happens a lot on Wikipedia theres a dramatic retirement to grab a little attention and then the same old crap starts again a few days in this case a few hours later Oh Yworo I forgot to mention this discussion in which an IP provided considerable evidence of your wikihounding the very thing you started the complaint against the IP about your being chastised for posting absurd sock puppet notices about an unknown banned user your history of mucking around with other editors talk page comments your history of making up policies to try to scare inexperienced editors your falsely claiming that a user was banned from ever placing warnings about your policy violations on your talk page your refusal to even discuss my complaint on an administrator board about your incivility in which admin Kim Dent Brown suggested that you use less frictioninducing language etc etc
