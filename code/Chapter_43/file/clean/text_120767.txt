NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM WIKIPEDIA 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent eventsedits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages  events that you were involved in  Never in all of my years in academia the better part of a decade have I been privy to such patentlyinsincere and downright academicallyfraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that scholarship and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive  propaganda has carried the day
My failure to grace the project with some actual academicallysound work was not made in vain however with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POVpushing agenda you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article Dodge v Ford Motor Company on Wikipedia
I strongly encourage you to alter your course set aside your agenda and reverse your  and Wikipedias  reputation as a laughing stock This will not only benefit the public in general but will I submit actually make you feel better about yourself Best JM
