Sam Songo Living 

Hello I noticed that you categorized Sam Songo as a living person I havent been able to find out much about him after his initial burst of popularity when the Mission School works were in vogue in the 1950s and early 60s Needless to say the records for that part of Africa arent exactly great Do you have any sources to verify that Mr Songo is indeed alive Thanks
