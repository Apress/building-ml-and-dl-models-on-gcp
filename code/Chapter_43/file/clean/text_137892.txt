I had a long apology here before but the system timed me out since a family crisis erupted in the middle therein So the long version was lost

Im really sorry I lost my temper before I apologize to Kyu and to those who have been trying to get this situation adjudicated 

Shell Enroth names names in the Churches on the Fringe article for Eternity magazine In Churches That Abuse he does not mention Open Door Community Churches or Hymers by namebut on page 115 paperback edition there are several passages that are clearly about Hymers groupright down to the restrictions on dating the insistence on vitamins the constant reference to clearing even very personal matters with the authorities in the church

I do regret my temper tantrum the other day and wont work on this in future unless Im in a clearheaded place and feeling more serene than I was the other day

Kyu I specifically apologize for referring to your edits as vandalism That was especially nasty of me and entirely uncalledfor Im sorry
