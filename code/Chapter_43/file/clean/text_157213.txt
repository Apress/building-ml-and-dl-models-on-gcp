Since you asked Id suck it up understand that Wikipedia is attempting to be encyclopedic and that statements here should be backed up by reliable sources and find one You claim youre essentially an expert on Britich comicswhats to stop me from making the same claim about physics We cant simply take an editors word for it that theyre qualified to speak about a particular subject This is discussed at length at WPV Making the effort to find a reliable source seems to me a more productive use of your time than dwelling on the fact that your information was removed for lacking one especially when its not an attack on you or a matter of questioning your credibility
