I am a native born resident of New York State and I plan to reinstate references to Senator Bruno as being acknowledged as Acting Lieutenant Governor Hes being acknowledged as such and another article on here refers to him as Acting Lieutenant Governor In the local television press hes being acknowledged as Acting Lieutenant Governor So therefor I would reinstate the references here deleted by another user if I can obtain a majority vote
