I wonder if your intention is to specifically stonewall and filibuster editors until they get tired of discussing issues with you or if that is just your regular attitude WP is not fun with your editing behaviour which centres on deleting as opposed to contributing I really do not mind editing with people with opposite opinions and in the past Nableezy my record will show with I think only you and the mysterious Mashkin as an exception the proper solutions could always be found You have very few edits showing an improving contribution and many many minor copyedits which suit your POV Thats fine but very unfortunate Someone with so much energy should be creating new articles and improving existing stubs and others
