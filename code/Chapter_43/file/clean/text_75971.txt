I changed this to science fiction as space opera seems the wrong categorization to me and as the article on space opera describes that genre as emphasizing romantic adventure interstellar travel and space battles none of which are main elements in Starcraft though one must assume that interstellar travel takes place and there are a few spacestation battles  If anyone can help me out with a better subgenre Id appreciate it but the assignment of the game to space opera seems highly specious  though perhaps theres something Im missing
