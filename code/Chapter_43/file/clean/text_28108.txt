Just be glad you were only blocked for 48 hours Getting mad over a block just proves the block was correct in the first place Terrorist

 Good luck 

Ceoil I dont plan to post at ANI again but I just wanted to remind you how much youre admired as an editor  Get mad if you cant help it but dont get so mad you leave  And if you can avoid getting mad and figure out how to get a productive outcome out of the conversation youre an even better editor than I thought   talk 

 My apologies 

Ceoil

Im obviously not a perfect person very far from it  I dont try and act as if I am and I do make more than my fair share of mistakes sometimes  Including my block of you yesterday  I dont view myself as above the law around here as it seems some people think I do and I hope you dont share their sentiment though I would not blame you for that right now  I cannot erase your block log but all I can do is offer my apologies for my mistake  I hope that any paths we cross from here on out are more than productive and hopefully someday we can look back on this with an amusing thread on our talk pages and laugh at my mistake  Either way please accept my sincerest apologies and I am a man who can recognize when he is wrong and this is one of those times  I wish you Happy Holidays and I hope to see you around the project

Very sincerely

I have no issue with you Jmlk17 as I said on your talk The reaction after is the issue   

 Truth and Reconciliation 

What happened to you was wrong The wrong was later undone but it cannot be reversed You are angry and you are justified in your anger because it happened It cannot however be changed but hopefully your anger will subside Cheers   

I hope you can take the advice from a stranger and leave your computer for a few hours Go do something else for a while and ignore us silly fools on wikipedia Sleep on it come back tomorrow and then we can talk about how things could be improved so things doesnt happen again Right now youre angry and reacting just waiting a few hours can drastically change ones outlook  I know Ive been pissed plenty of times myself After all this is just a website henriktalk 
Thanks but my whole point is that this stuff gets washed under the carpet and nobody is listening Im not going to let this go   
 Im not suggesting anything getting washed under the carpet I just hope you can wait a few hours or until tomorrow before proceeding henriktalk 
Thanks Great advise   

 Tongue in cheek 

Dont take my shallow or rather tongue in cheek comments at WPAN at face value I actually spend a fair amount of time trying to calm the lynch mobs around here and my most recent effort was unsuccessful So Ive been venting a bit  and perhaps aping the attitude of the ban hammerers  at your expense I hope you didnt take anything I wrote too seriously If you ever were the subject of an unjust block that no admin wanted to lift Id be among those leaping to your defense  talk 
Well you did get unblocked The halfserious part is there are plenty of editors less fortunate than you Try to keep that in mind  talk 
Recently i havent found myself in agreement with Kendrick He is absolutely right here though You might want to take a deep breath and relax the tone in your emails messagesI know how easy it is to take offense and fight off the overriding desire to chop your fellow editors into little civil cubes but honestly it doesnt work Its hard on the assumption of good faith and its hard on the furniture Maybe live and let live   cast a spell 0209
