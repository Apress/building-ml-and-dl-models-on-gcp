Full names
I made a mistake in my comment about my edit however is there any policy about full names  See George W Bush

General style guidelines indicate once you use a persons full name in an article you dont have to use it again for readability  Of course there are exceptions for instance if you were discussing George W Bush and George HW Bush in the same article it would only make sense to be more specific   0542 4 Apr 2005 UTC

I am not a crook  never obstructed justice
Text of press conference  extracted version  

Neither of the above partial and incomplete transcripts contain Nixons quote or the question to which he responded
you cant find it in the official text of httpwatergateinfojudiciaryAPPIPDF or the extrated version cause its not there The House Judiciary Committee which was holding the Watergate hearings it appears did feel questions on Nixons personal finances and taxes returns were not germane to thier proceedings
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me  Im sure there is a transcript out there that contains both the question asked of Nixon as well as his response that the plumbers havent gotten to yet   7 July 2005 2106 UTC

From Facts on File 1973 Volume 33 No 1719 Oct 713 1973 pg 854 
The White House refused to confirm or deny an Oct 3 report in the Providence RI JournalBulletin that President and Mrs Nixon paid only 79281 in federal income taxes for 1970 and 87803 in 1971

From Facts on File 1973 Volume 33 No 1725 Nov 1824 1973 pg 964 
The President made the declaration in discussing his personal finances  The President was asked about a press report he paid 792 in federal income tax in 1970 and 878 in 1971 and whether public officials should disclose their personal finances

Still no transcript of the question above  Accuracy and POV of the above quotes questionable as well  persoanl Presidnet inbcome
So I am a half blind clutz who can barely type 30 words per minute nonetheless they are accurate citations that can be found in virtually any public library
 I didnt mean to demean your typing skills  I make my fair share of mistakes as well  My intent was to point out that the above 2 extracts from Facts on File do not specifically relay the content of the question to which Nixon was responding when he mentioned never having obstructed justice  7 July 2005 2106 UTC  

New York Times article by R W Apple November 17 1973 

The above cited NYTimes article does not present the question to which Nixon responded  
You will find this in virtually all press accounts of the event because the question had nothing to do with Watergate  The best they can do is call it Watergate related or allied
 Actually you are incorrect  The Post article specifically states that he was responding to Watergate related questions  Of course he is talking about his personal finances and taxes when he says he has never profited from his position  but that is not the whole quote  You seem to keep evading discussion on the part where he also denies obstructing justice  I believe that if we had a transcript of exactly what he is responding to it would go a long way to clearing things up  7 July 2005 2106 UTC

It does however support the fact that the cursory investigations were indeed related to the Watergate investigations After months of torment over the Watergate and allied scandals the President gave detailed answers to more than a dozen questions  Further support that Nixons quote and the Watergate scandal are at least somewhat related can be found in the Washington Post article here

Declaring that I am not a crook President Nixon vigorously defended his record in the Watergate case tonight and said he had never profited from his public service  In an hourlong televised questionandanswer session with 400 Associated Press managing editors Mr Nixon was tense and sometimes misspoke But he maint
