Well thank you We certainly agree on fundamental difficulty in communicating I am able to hear what you have to say I dont perceive you as a Great Evil in your idiom or illintended except perhaps on one point Ill go into later and I can generally extend good faith when one is open to public discussion Given the many confusions involved I first need to know 1 Are you now willing as I am to discuss the primary issues in detail in a consensusbuilding discussion subject to such WPBRD principles as listen very carefully and be ready to compromise
If so the first consensus I need is whether an article should exist on the topic of dramaticallyconcentrated shortperiod political fundraising Your objections at AFD appear to me primarily as magnet for editwarring and WPCOATRACK you raise other concerns related to neologism but they do not enter into the question as Ive phrased it These concerns both seem bad arguments per WPRUBBISH because they are surmountable problems and Wikipedians may not delete based on creator intent but on criteria like notability we are expected to resolve edit wars and coatracks by DR not deletion 2 Given this for what reasons if any would you oppose existence of an article on the topic of dramaticallyconcentrated shortperiod political fundraising If none I would ask you to change your AFD entry at this point in good faith
The second consensus I need is how to disambiguate the search string moneybomb Previously you advocated google bomb as the primary redirect Independent of the previous paragraph I would ask 3 What is your specific justification that users entering the string moneybomb would be interested primarily in a detailed description of search manipulation with a mention of the fundraising form without further fundraising elaboration If none please propose alternate disambiguation specifics This proposition which your position amounts to would imply there is greater connection of the string moneybomb with search manipulation than with fundraising which is an exceptional claim to me requiring detailed explanation Im sure you recognize that both reliable sources on this point use the string money bombing and significantly not moneybomb
This must suffice to begin Please reply to these details first before we build to other matters such as policies
