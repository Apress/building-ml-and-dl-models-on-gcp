New Page Patrol 

Hello Thank you for your comments on my talk page I have thoroughly read all policies When new page patrolling I tend to do only the blatant vandalism nonsense or otherwise obvious infringements Again thank your for your comments   

I  would rather you  stopped patrolling  new pages and concentrated on  vandalism instead Theoretically  you  still  dont have the required experience to  even enroll  at  the WPCVUA  to  learn how to do  that Borb√°nya is an example of an article you  recently  patrolled that  is far to  complicated for you and which can only  be patrolled by  an expert Just  as an example not  only  am  I  possibly one of the most  experienced admins but  I  am  also  a retired professor of linguistics and it  still  took  me at  least  10 minutes to do  everything  that was needed for that  page
