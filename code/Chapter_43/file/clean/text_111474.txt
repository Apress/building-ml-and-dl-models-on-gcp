The borders appear to have been set at 12th Street and Halsted Street after the 1871 fire see this article I have to guess that city limits formed the other two boundaries but havent found any information on that in the ten minutes Ive been searching

That same article indicates that the fire limits were expanded in 1874 after a second major fire to cover the whole city That may contradict the Humboldt Park article but Im not sure  In any case the fire limits survive on as chapter 13116 of the current Chicago Municipal Code they cover all zoning districts within the corporate limits classified B11 through B77 and C11 through C4 as defined in the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of May 29 1957 as amended together with an additional 200 feet in all directions from the outer limits of each area or areas so classified This appears to mean that most business and commercial districts in Chicago are governed by the fire limits regulations but its hard to tell The 1957 zoning ordinance has been superseded and the Citys online zoning map doesnt have the fire limits noted on it
