Multiple sequential edits 

Hello After reviewing your editing on Ivy Taylor pursuant to a report filed against you at WPANEW I noticed that you tend to make a great many edits all in a row each edit only adding a sentence or phrase or a couple of template parameters a wikilink etc  I strongly encourage you to consider making more these edits simultaneously and submitting them all at once as opposed to making a lengthy sequence of small changes  This makes page histories much easier to read
