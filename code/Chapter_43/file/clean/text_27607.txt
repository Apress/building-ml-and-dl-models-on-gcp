Legal status I suspect that the Internal Troops are indeed legally Gendarmies which means that they are subject to the same treatment as any other internal force For example American Police officers oath is identical to that of soldiers except for the juridiction of So I X do solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States agaisnt all enemies foreign and domestic in the jurisdiction Y In the unlikely case of an invasion US policesheriffs would act as the light infantry So Internal Troops would be treated as troops rather than civillians I am not 100 sure but pretty sure Other than that i dont think they rate any official status as soldiers but again I suspect they have the same status as the local border patrol coast guard That they are civillian in peace soldiers in war
