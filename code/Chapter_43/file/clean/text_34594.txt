Keep up the Good Work 

Ive reverted the Deir Yassin thing like youve been doing This entire category is such a complete work of fiction and vandalism by antisemitic editors just plain making stuff up

Correction Vandalism by AntiSemitic editors quoting stuff made up by this same Benevisti guy over and over and over again in each article Aparently no other historian but Benevisti is considered reliable

Keep up the good fight against the vandals 704971207
