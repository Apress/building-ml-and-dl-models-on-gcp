Suborbital in spaceflight list

I was wondering why the the spaceloft XL suborbital flights are included in this list They go into space with regards to altitude but dont achieve orbital speeds If you include such suborbital flights you also have to include other sounding rocket flights such as Maxtor and ICBM test launches IMHO
