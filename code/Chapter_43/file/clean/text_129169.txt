About Korean language
Hi Chink Well its well known that Wikiepdia is contaminated by many Chinese propagandists who spread lies Chinese hate the term of Altaic since they has been conquered by Altaic people throughout history Most of all they want to cut any relation between Manchu and Korean as its shown in their very political attempts in Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences They have good many reasons to make Korean as language isolate

Anyway stepping off this kind of their political attempts The notion that Most classify it as a language isolate while a few consider it to be in the Altaic language family is wrong no its a fake There are two references that chinks insists they support the notion but theres no such phrases in the references

Have you ever checked the reference Or are you suffering from dyslexia Where in the reference Song Jae Jung 2005 The Korean language structure use and context Routledge p 15 can you find a phrase that make you tell Most classify it as a language isolate and the same with  a few consider it to be in the Altaic language family

As in the reference Song Jae Jung 2005 The Korean language structure use and context Routledge p 15 the author says While controvesial Korean as Altaic is more accpeted as any other views And they are many who see it a language isolate So wheres a remark that most classify it as a language isolate My dear chinky propagandist
