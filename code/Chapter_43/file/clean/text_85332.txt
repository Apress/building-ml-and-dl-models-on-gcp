Bill Mahers are overwhelmingly LIBERAL and he always attacks Bush and his conservative guests  This is show is an unfair and unbalanced as it could possibly be  Overwhelmingly liberal show me 1 show where conservatives outnumbered liberals on it  Or where Maher himself took 1 conservative position and talked about it  He also frequently attacks Reagan and Karl Rove and acts like just because Republicans win these elections their the only ones using negative ads both parties do that and any American would agree
