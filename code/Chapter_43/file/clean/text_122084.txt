Although this is first person research I can assure you there was never any term like Stoffel Makraov even if it had been spelled correctly The Makarov pistols were sold all throughout the late 80s and early 90s in the USA for about 50 USD each They were imported by anyone and everyone Stoffell was not famous for anything prior to 2004 Even among us contractors its not much of a story  Again this holds exactly no weight  but neither do the statements on the front page7117011144   Milby
