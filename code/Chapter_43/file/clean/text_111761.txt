Edit Summary Request
I have noted that you edit without an edit summary Please do your best to always fill in the summary field This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia Even a short summary is better than no summary An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text otherwise people may think youre being sneaky or even vandalizing Also mentioning one change but not another one can be misleading to someone who finds the other one more important add and misc to cover the other changes Thanks    hablame aqui
