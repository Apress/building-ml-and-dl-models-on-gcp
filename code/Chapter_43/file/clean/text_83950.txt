Irish Flag 

You contradict yourself by saying that Ireland partake in the Heineken cup and that Ireland have won it four times with 2 runers up What you are arguing is that Ireland never won it rather the IRFU did and in  that case Ireland should be replaced with IRFU Since the IRFU is an Irish organisation and all the players are contracted to it they therefore play under the Irish Flag Irish rugby is not governed by politics I suggest you agree to stop reverting edits or remove all the international flags from the clubs since they all host international players
