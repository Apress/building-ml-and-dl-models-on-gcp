My accounts name 
Well I do have one last concern My accounts name FDR is kind of strange because Im not Franklin Roosevelt Since I want to be all serious now instead of partially serious I think that either it should be renamed or I should use the talk page of one of my other accounts Tiptoety could this account be renamed or alternatively could I use the account PaulBustion87 instead PaulBustion87 is a very normal screen name since its my name and year of birth so using it would be more socially appropriate than FDR I remember when I went to college one of my friends thought the screen name choice inappropriate And I agree with him My mother laughed when I told her that was my wikipedia screen name
