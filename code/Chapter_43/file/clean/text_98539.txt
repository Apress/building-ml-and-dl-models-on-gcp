Ill look at it tomorrow  Im in a big hurry now  Someone wrote to me and suspects that you may have a sockpuppet reading between the lines  A sockpuppet is when one has a 2nd account  If used to support ones edits or to do things that you would be embarrassed to do thats considered improper  On wikipedia some people are on the lookout for sockpuppets then invoke harsh sanctions  Other times people are too quick to accuse others of sockpuppetry  You can lookup sockpuppet for a more extensive definition as well as look up SSP to see people getting punished  Wikipedia also has a checkuser function for a select small group of administrators who can look up your IP address and make further conclusions  The person who came to me was concerned about some speedy deletion tags or maybe wiping them out
