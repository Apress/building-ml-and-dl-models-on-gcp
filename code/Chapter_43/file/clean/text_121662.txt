Your Wiki etiquette faux pas
I note your lack of adherence to Wikipedia Etiquette with regard to following written procedure and notifying the aggrieved party of the alleged infraction of this subjective civility issue I am more than willing to overlook this error  I do question your interest in an issue which is tangential in extreme to yourself 
I note with interest Merbabu effectively agrees with my edits and the rationale behind them Though it does indeed raise the issue of conflict of interest It could be charged Singaporeans and Australians as beneficiaries of British theftcolonialism is the issue of conflict of interest pertinent here Does Mr Dave have an opinion on this and perhaps can elucidate in manner a simple Malay may understand to clarify whether or not you feel you may or may not have a conflict of interest with regards to any military article of Indoneisa I keenly await your own learned views on conflict of interest Sincerely
