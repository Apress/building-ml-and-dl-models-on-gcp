NoAfD proposal 
Consider the background to Mtking and Newmanoconnor immediately agreeing to your noAfD proposal Just a week ago they wouldnt have even given you the time of day The current situation has them very scared and theyll pretty much do anything do anything to fasttrack their terrible plan through This is why theyre talking 12 week timelines whereas before theyve been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfDing everything in sight Of course shorttracking necessarily means theyll railroad the MMA voices against If they dont get the shorttrack their plan is essentially dead which is why theyll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term Whats most notable is that even if they get what they want it doesnt mean they dont AfD again right after they get approval Their plan has no brightline rules and its vague and open to interpretation which is why AfD are effective now The situation after will be no better but well be stuck with it while theyre not saddled with anything

Theres basically two choices right now let them stick it to the MMA community with a terrible plan or create a process where they dont have complete control Please make that choice carefully
