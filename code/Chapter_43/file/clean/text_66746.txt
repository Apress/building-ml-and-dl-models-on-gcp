Are my comments really nonsense 

Re Well you could start by proposing changes rather than criticising one of the admins who has show he understands the issues associated with the various UK Pages I have had my run ins with him but the above comments a nonsense I also see that you are a new user who has jumped straight into a controversial area Snowded TALK 

I have to ask as a new user whether calling someone elses comments nonsense is normal Wiki practice  I suspect it is not  Before using such language perhaps you might learn whether proposals had been suggested  As it happens the editor in question has engaged in an edit war over each of my successive and different proposals without offering any feedback on my edits  Ill keep my mitts off your comments as long as you use your mitts to keep your impolite comments to yourself  As for the controversial area involved I have been involved in it for about 10 years not in the lofty ivory towers of Wikiland but in the lowly corridors of research universities both in the US and in the UK  Dylan Hunt
