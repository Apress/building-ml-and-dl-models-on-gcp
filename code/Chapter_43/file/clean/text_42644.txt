I get what youre saying and I was more than happy with him in the Legends section  But when they include him in the open theyre putting forth that hes looked at as a member of the roster and a part of the show

Basically theyre saying Hey look Rocks a Raw guy

And techincally hes the number 1 contender to the WWE Title since John Cena is the champion I know theres no guarantee Cenas the champ at Mania but as of now Rockys got a championship match on a PPV thus he should be part of the roster for that alone

But mainly since hes featured in the open that shows that WWE is pushing him as part of Raw

And if 30 days passes wo a Rock sighting then he gets reactivated when he comes back
