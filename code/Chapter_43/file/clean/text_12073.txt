Already been to WPDRV But essentially you did have a reasoning beyond no consensus after all Either my judgement on policy has completely failed me all of a sudden  or the article did not easily pass WPNOR at all and certainly failed WPNPOV But as I wrote during the debate an issue as complex as this requires a firm understanding of the way the article interacts with our policies and how it fails them These types of articles also require the closing admin to have a firm understanding of the debate and how it interacts with policy The problems surrounding this and similar articles and debates will run and run until they are properly addressed then all will come out in the wash and this interaction between us will help people understand the problems that have arisen Thank youtalk
