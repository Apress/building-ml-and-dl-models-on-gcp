Agreement to Mediate Withdrawn
I hereby withdraw my agreement to mediate the dispute Wikipedia talkRequests for mediationThe Man Who Would Be Queen  It cannot go forward in good faith  Mediation is a arrangement agreed to among equals  Since the actions of the greater wikipedia community have made clear my feelings and thoughts are to be disregarded then I cannot participate in a mediation I have not been treated as an equal when blatantly homophobic and transphobic or just plain rude remarks made against me are ignore and my hurt feelings ridiculed or made to be invalid  Whatever I say will be ignored and the words of another who has white heterosexual male privilege or some combinations of those will be more valued  I will not subject myself to this  I say that it was farcical to try to mediate this in the first place  Deep down we all knew that this would not work in the end so why prolong the suffering  

This matter should again be remanded for arbitration

As of this notification on my talk page I consider my disagreement to the mediation registered
