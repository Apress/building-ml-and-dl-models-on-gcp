Requested move 

Πpad  Π pad  The noun form of a compound does not generally carry a hyphen  To make this article consistent with L pad and T pad we should move it  Sources are mixed on this but nobody has objected to my proposal section above on article talk page  But Π pad is on the MediaWiki_talkTitleblacklist so I wasnt able to move it
