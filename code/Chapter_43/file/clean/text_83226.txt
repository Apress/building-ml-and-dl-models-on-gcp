Hi RomGuig why did you undo my edits to La Plagne The information was taken from the La Plagne piste map 20062007 version and from my knowledge  I lived in La Plagne last year and know a lot about the placeMaybe some of the info is original research so that can be deleted but the infobox is useful and I think it should remain in the article
