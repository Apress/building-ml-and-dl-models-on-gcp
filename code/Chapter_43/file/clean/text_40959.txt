Im sorry Im not an admin I will give you three pieces of advice though First edit other pages and keep away from this guy Second if you cant do that get a new user ID just for those pages and try to stick within the policies of Wikipedia Dont let the guy in question know that youre you If another user breaches the policies note it on their talkpage politely and make a note for the case you will later bring against them If he protects pages hes editing blocks you for disputing content anything like that then note it Just make sure you personally stay within the policies stay cool and stay polite Third start an RfC Youll need to find someone else who has also suffered at this guys hands If hes as bad as you make out it wont be hard to find someone If the RfC doesnt bring an outcome you can live with take your case to the arbcom They will almost certainly back the admin and make out you are full of shit so if you go that route just lay out your evidence and walk away Dont get involved Dont let it get to you or make you mad
