i did a whole new section placing clairsentience in the context of altered states with references to mckenna  tim leary  gordon wasson  shamanic use of ayuhasca  iboga shamnic drumming and dancing the protestent shaker movement  the whirling dervishes   and even a mental health section showing how all of the phenomena thought meaningfull to one group was equally thought to be symptomatic of various mental health diagnosis

my aproach was agnostic and included all aproaches with equal validity so that any curios reader  could follow their own path of reasoning  and research

i thought from the nature of your remarks elsewhere and your chosen study area that you mighht be sympathetique cheers  

childish redirect

the article presently on the main Clairsentience page  if it stays there for 5 minutes  is the old first draft before months of work was childishly trashed and a meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page put in its place 

the playground games continue

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clarirsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work  rewrites  endless discussion  removasl of personal matereal  edits for style and content  endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer  punctuation  re editting for stlye and content  and much help in correct sourcing and referencing   

this article was the sum  of many peoples input  effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page any help would be great cheers  

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article let me askwhat was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anywayyou should have told me t get lost out of here what was the point of it all  why did i listen to you  at all  why did i remove all personal references  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail   why did i edit and re edit for style and content   why did i make additional references to religios  anthropological socialogical  philosophical medical  physics  chemistry  botany  mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort  your actions are without integrity or honour  

clairsentience article redirect 

Hi  whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect  can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period
i could delete this clairvoyance article but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl

 i hope you can respect the clairsentience article

 ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it
