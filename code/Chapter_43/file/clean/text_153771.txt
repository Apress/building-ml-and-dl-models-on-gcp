No problem and thanks for asking You can criticize me all you want 
  I remember the registered account better so Ill take him first The PA was from two days ago and I have a hard time blocking someone for something done that long ago particularly since no one acted on it in the meantime His edit today goes back to something I said at AN yesterday about American admins me included being clueless about football and footballers I dont know if the edit he made today is good or not  I know theres a timestamp you guys use and it looks like he updated that so its not clear vandalism to me More on that in a sec
 To your IPs the first IP hasnt edited today at all and the second has made one edit today That may be long term disruption but its not current vandalism The reports sat for several hours with no action and its become our practice at AIV to clear the old andor stale reports after say five or six hours If theyre sitting there that long with that many people watching and no one has acted yet theyre not going to and any vandalism or disruption from those accounts has stopped or never started in the first place  youd be surprised 
 I know  is familiar with football so if youre having some trouble with current ongoing vandalism to a footballfootballer article and havent found a solution you might see if hes active then and ping him to take a look Were trying to get these early American am problems resolved its been an ongoing issue for many months now Ive been a little under the weather and one of our main AIVRFPP admins is on a break right now but hopefully well do better If you have more questions lemme have em  Katietalk
