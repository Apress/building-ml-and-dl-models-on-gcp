Actually I haventbut I am still going to watch that video I always figured out the postcredit scenes of Marvel movies before I have seen it so its no big deal to me I would say that its probably got a better Peter Parker but I am not sure on the movie being better I would say its got enough difference on the movie to be entertaining All the same old is Parker gets bullied by Flash even though the bully seems more fleshed out Peter gets bitten and Uncle Ben dies That had to be in there anyways If so it would have been unfaithful to the comics origin  777
