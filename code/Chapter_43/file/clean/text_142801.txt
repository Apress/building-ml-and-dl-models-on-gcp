Link to UST Global leadership team 

Hi EdJohnston

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link httpwwwustglobalcomleadershipaspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdatedwrong info about an article in Wikipedia Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun
 Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here This is very important Could you please check the link httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleUST_Globallimit500actionhistory

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007 The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross He added himself as cofounder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company Dont you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website wwwustglobalcom
Also I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page
