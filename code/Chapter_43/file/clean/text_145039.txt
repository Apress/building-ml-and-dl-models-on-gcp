You make the case for this becoming a redirect yourself  the company is not notable outside of this single product Routine facts about a company do not assert notability Notability is not inherited G11 is applicable when the subject presents no encyclopedic value whatsoever so the article becomes nothing more than an advertisement regardless of the language or material used because it is an article about a company It could have been tagged with A7 instead I see youre familiar with this stuff and it would have been deleted outright But because there is a single claim to notability the product I opted to reverse my own speedy tag and create a redirect Sometimes its just too soon and the company just isnt there yet but maybe in the future it will The release of a second highlyregarded product would possibly merit upgrading the redirect to a fullfledged article croak
