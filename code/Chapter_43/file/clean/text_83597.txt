Regarding your other admonitions concerning my responses to this person Hoary I have been attempting to improve the article via a constructive colloquy with the editor Æµœš¹  This Hoary person appears get his orgasmic jollies making asinine slurs and commentary that does not address the subject of my article nor the inconsistencies in his or her logic  I have verbally cleaned this person Hoarys clock and yet this person Hoary keeps coming back for more  Clearly this person Hoary loves the sadomasochistic verbal exchanges that he or she has invited and is having with me  You would do better to make your admonitions to this Hoary person because I will not tolerate dog whistle insults and racial slurs from Hoary you or anyone else  So you just block my edits all you want Blocking my edits wont make the inaccuracies and outright lies that Wikipedia is disseminating on the subject of Ebonics accurate or true   If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page  Ebonics is not Black English African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved NigerCongo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs  If you do not understand his fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated
