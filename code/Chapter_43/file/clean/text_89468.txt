I suppose this is the fundamental difference between us You see people like me putting it all onto Wikipedia is wrong because you think its an encyclopedia Me I see it as a natural extension of what Wikipedia really is It is the people that edit Wikipedia articles that make it what it is and what it aint We really dont need to argue about who is right and who isnt because right and wrong dont factor into it What does matter is how many people do it one way and how many people do it another way
