Nuclear the above is NOT how u cite the article  U MUST cite the original source  Do it like this   Yarri article 1879 in ABC Online httpwwwabcnetau

I think ABC it would have originated at ABC Riverina got it out of Butchers book though in which case all three cites must be there as per above with one added  The original cite goes in italics then the next is underlined then the next something else  All three must be noted though  If ABC got it straight from the original paper at Gundagai Library then no need to cite Butchers book but MUST cite its original source
