About the Sum 41 edits 

I think the way you did it that it goes with two chronologies studio and nonstudio albums it is very confusing and I havent come across any band and this goes for bands with even more albums and EPs to have such a split chronology between studio and nonstudio albums I think itll be for the best if there will be one chronology with all the studio albums live EPs etc like most bands its less confusing that way Full discography could be viewed in the discography page anyway so thats my opinion I think itll be better this way
