  TABA polemic is an aggressive debate attack on or refutation of the opinions or principles of another How on Earth is my contribution therefore a polemic
Surely your own statement is more akin to a polemic

You state that I hate English for instance which is a studied insult and a liebut then if you intend to be aggressive I suppose that this is only to be expected

You write English Medium on the other hand means what any of the zillion pages that a Google search on that term tells you that it means 

Surely the point of my article is to explain what it means something that had been lacking up until now in Wikipedia

If you have problems with my so called polemic then surely you can amend it or add to it instead of erasing it 

Are you in favour of free expresion and the dissemination of knowledge or censorship and dictatorship

I would have expected more from one who is entrusted with editorial powers
Wikipedia content is intended to be factual notable verifiable with external sources and neutrally presented with external sources cited and I will always strive to meet these criteriayour help therefore would be appreciated but not your obvious attempts at personal insult

I have tried to define what English medium education is and to give a short history of its origins and effects That I have dwelt on subject matter from these islands is because of my specific knowledge in this area

I have not sought to offend your sensibilities regarding your own mother tongue  my mother tongue is English or your sense of belonging or not belonging to a particular national grouping That you evidently think that this was my intention is of course a cause of great concern for me and one which I would like to rectify
