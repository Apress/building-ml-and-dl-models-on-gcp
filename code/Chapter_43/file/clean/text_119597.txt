I dont think its an exception when claiming United Macedonia they usually just refer to Aegean Vardar and Pirin Macedonia the parts in Greece and Serbia are just included in the terms Aegean and Vardar Macedonia respectively As long as this article says in the note at the top that its about the term the profile of Greek Macedonia really has no place here
