 Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Mens tournament  Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Mens indoor tournament
 Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Womens tournament  Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Womens indoor tournament
 Beach volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Mens tournament  Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Mens beach tournament
 Beach volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Womens tournament  Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Womens beach tournament
 Volleyball in the Olympic context seems to refer to both volleyball in general and indoor volleyball specifically I think we need to clarify this and create a uniform pattern for the names of these articles Since both indoor and beach volleyball are presented in Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics article and the sports are basically the same the prefix bit should be uniform hence this proposal When this issue is decided we can go on with the older Olympics tournaments which follow neither of the above name patterns
