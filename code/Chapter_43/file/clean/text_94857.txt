Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen apart from painful neutrality issue Im concerned with the growing deformation of the articles structure and style Im talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicelydetailed sentences as well as irrelevant images from Ukraine section and the other side seemed to agree nonimages edit Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section although the intro looks better now Editors who responsible for this did you care reading section in the whole And more new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared Not to mention the images which litter only Ukraine section is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors

Why doing things like that I can understand POVpushing intentions of propartisans users But we must first of all care about innocent readers not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine Otherwise the project would degrade and Jimbo would run out of his budget

Distinctively on images issue I will put NPOV tag unless they will be removed in a week
