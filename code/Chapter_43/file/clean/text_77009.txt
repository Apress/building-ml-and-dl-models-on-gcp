Hebrew sources 

As some of you Nishidani and who saw I have cited several Hebrew sources where I couldnt find any English sources I belive that no one doubts Ynet and Haaretz who are two of Israels most read news website who both have versions in English and also Walla which does not have any but still one of the main sites Just wanted to make sure no one is going to cry that Hebrew Sources are not reliable I could always translate an article for you if you really boubt it talk to me
