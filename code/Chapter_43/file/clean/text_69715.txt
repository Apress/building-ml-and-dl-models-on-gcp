 LuaLua 

Hey Excellent work on this article and I was wandering whether you would be inteterested in a GAC nomination  
Its easy to nominate see the instructions at WPGAC And of course continue the article further Thanks  

 George Kay 

I have expanded this article to cover his management career esp at Southampton and Liverpool but the section on his playing career is rather brief As you appear to be a West Ham United fan is there any chance that you could add something to expand this section It would be great if we could bring an article about someone from the relatively distant past up to FA standard   
Thanks for the work you put it especially for sorting out the confusion between Belfast Celtic and Distillery Do you think the article is now ready for Peer Review If so how do we go about it Cheers   
Ive now put the article up for peer review at WikipediaPeer reviewGeorge Kay Well see what response we get Thanks for your help   

 Keynsham Town FC 

Please do edit the page I think it has issues We are STILL waiting for the technician to finish the official website but then I can put the first team on there and then finally put it on WP  23 
Sorry cant suggest any good sites to use off the top of my head My dad always uses a site that has lots of information about clubs if only I could remember what it was called Will get back to you when I remember  23 

 Under Construction tag on Carrie Hayden 

Thanks for the tag  Im fairly new to editing so havent got a clue about tags  
No problem that will give you a little time to expand the article Note that you still have to demonstrate notability  

 Samizu Matsuki   documentary link added 

Malcolmxl5 Per your advice Ive located documentation of artist Samizu Matsukis painting awards of 1970 and 1971 and added an external link to it on her wikipedia biography It consists of excerpts from the book ArtistsUSA 197273  Guide to Contemporary Art Library of Congress Catalog Number 78134303 ISSN 01966154  Would you assess the worthiness of the reference for documenting her awards See httppenbayorgsamizuawardssamizu_awardshtml Penbay  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
