BUMP
I hear you
My read was that there sources were credible on those pages cited
I feel that since there is myths part of the article that these notes do suggest something
Mainly these notes the FOIA files contain heretofore unknown information
This information and the fact that such a file even exists lends some credit to speculation about Earhart
I feel that since this material is from the USA FBI that it is noteworthy
after all why be the one who stops such things from becoming truly public
I FLAT OUT BELIEVE SHE WAS TAKEN PRISONERAND USED BY THE JAPANESE AND THAT THE FACT WAS COVERED UP
