Assessment vs diagnosis 

This section was moved here from Comments subpage by TalkCs  

I am new to this and finding my way so sorry if I get things wrong I am a British Art Therapistand a Council Member British Association of Art Therapists The art therapy article as it stands is very US based and there are significant differences I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind My first proposed addition is this in the section on assessment tools

It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally Assessment is easily confused with diagnosis Because diagnosis is a medical function rather than a therapeutic one British art therapists tend to resist the implied medicalisation of what is essentially a non medical approach which concentrates on seeing the person not the label The British Association of Art Therapists statement on diagnosis simply states that Art Therapists do not diagnose httpwwwbaatorguk

Any thoughts on this before I go ahead
