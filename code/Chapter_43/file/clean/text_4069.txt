Thanks for the tipoff on my talkpage Id prefer old disputes were left in the past which is where they belong rather than permanent records being kept of the merest thing Its disappointing that many of the presumably younger Wikipedians on VfD feel differently Anyway as I said thanks for the tipoff

I see you have changed back my changes to the MoS I have left three queries for you on the talk page Id be grateful if you would look at them and answer them I would then suggest we do not readdress the issue for a while and let other Wikipedians add their commments Kind regards  1602 28 Dec 2004 UTC
