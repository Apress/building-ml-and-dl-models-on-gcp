Listen I dont believe that Greece is 98 Greek I remember reading somewhere something about official statistics finding that 10 of the population of Greece do not hold Greek citizenship ie are immigrants Perhaps the 98 figure pertains to the remaining 90 which would be something like 882 of the total population I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though What is interesting is the question of what are the Roma GypsiesΤσιγγάνοι According to the Greek government again they number about 200000  are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure According to official statistics again 1991 census the Thrace minority is 098 of the total population at that time about 288 of the total population of Thace at that time I think we should just stick with The World Factbooks estimate and avoid all the speculation
