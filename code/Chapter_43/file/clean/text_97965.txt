Your moves of turtle pages 

Was wondering why you made a series of changes to the turtle pages I am assuming it was for common names but the names you used are ambiguous at best The Dinner plate turtle has not been referred as such commonly for decades the Northern Snapping turtle has several common names of equal usage The Northern snake neck is more commonly referred to as the northern long neck etc These species were better off under their scientific names I would prefer it if you would discuss such changes on the talk pages or the turtle portal before just doing it Cheers  talk
