I would agree with the above user One thing that you should learn when contributing to Wikipedia is that some admins are not only corrupt but have a corrupt following SlimVirgin is one of these admins Your approach is a bit heavyhanded and thats not going to work  you are dealing with a cabal Im sorry that you have been treated in such an unwelcome manner Personally I welcome you
I find it plauible that what SlimVirgin is calling disruption were simply edits made in good faith to improve Wikipedia Disruption is a catchphrase of this admin I would advise however that you not tag the article or any related articles for AFD again Edit with caution and try to avoid significant edits to any articles that SlimVirgin and Friends own Good luck with your contributions   talk  contribs 0940
