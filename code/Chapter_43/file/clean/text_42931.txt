Well Im hope you can add a bit every little helps But in all honesty FAs can be improved over time what matters I think is there is a Themes section which makes life easier for both Production and Reception But just how much can we include in Themes for various articles really Im being bugged by Titanic should I include everything on the films script in Themes and Historical accuracy and just focus on the shoot and editing in Production Im also really thinking about each LotR article is it satisfactory to have each article with a section on the adaptation drawing away from the actual legal development of the films I guess each article has its own flow
