FYI 

  This is just to bring to your attention that this last edit to Fibromyalgia puts you at 3rr  You have reverted multiple editors during this so I would like to suggest that instead of edit warring about it please take your concerns to the talk page to discuss  I am sure the editors will be willing to talk to you about this  Thanks for listening Talk
