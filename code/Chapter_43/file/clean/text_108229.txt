Hey
What I know is that the medal tables are filled anyway because in the same article Im seeing tables with different medal and time orders So do not talk to me about rules You when you fill the meda tables not follow and dont observe the actually order of the frames Im arranging them in a logical way order of importance of the medals goldsilverbronze  date order first to last medal What are you complaining about Im just fixing a giant mess
