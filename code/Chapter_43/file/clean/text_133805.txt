The DSI connector is real here httpwwwraspberrypiorgforumfeaturesandrequestslcdlvdsinterfaceforraspberrypi is a discussion on how to use it to make a LVDS signal it also mentions that the SoC is capable of creating a second independent video signal yes you can connect two monitors this way after all There was some initial doubt on whether these connectors would actually be mounted on the board but this  discussion confirms they were mounted I mentioned on the forum  that using the DSI signal might be a way to fix the missing VGA output problem
