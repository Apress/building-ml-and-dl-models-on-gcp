Ok lets take the specific example 
I am upgrading the information on Romanias main article AND then I realize that the transportation article is simply a stub 
I copy the information to the transport from the main article that information that I initially added MYSELF in the main article
I realize that the main article on Romania will be trimmed down a lot 
I do not have time to trim the main article myself so I will let other ppl do it
meanwhile the extended information is stored in the more specific article about transportation
 where did I do wrong
