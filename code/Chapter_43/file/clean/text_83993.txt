Deletion votes and username
Thanks for the advice on the deletion votes  Ill try to be more descriptive of why I think these things should be kept However it was not my understanding that a vote would be discounted simply because no explanation was given
Re my username while I understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral accurate encyclopedia creative and innovative approaches are helpful I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities Many people who say they are against trolling are actually when you talk to them about it against vandalism personal attacks or timewasting none of which I condone I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community and more willing to try to understand each other  in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible Thanks for you advice hope to see you around  1047 2 Mar 2005 UTC
