Youve got no call to start attacking me ad hominem I know damned well how to use the history and talk pages As for shoddy research I like many others consider the schools own style guide to be the final word on the issue The schools publications are entirely consistent with this Anyway Im through with this You obviously care about this WAY more than anyone else Im sure others will come along and make this correction repeatedly until you back down since the public style guide is probably what most people will consider the ultimate authority on this Dont bother messaging me back I dont care that much
