The Solomon Islands recognizes Abkhazia and South Ossetia A strange forum source is found May not be real 

I was reasearching the recogntion of these two territories and I found this strange source on a forum It seems that the Russia has reported that the Solomon Islands have recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia however I cannot find any source that they actually did do that I looked everywhere so I can not take this as an actual source If anybody can please find source on the decision of the Solomon Islands if there is no source found then the forum idea may be fake I suggest that users take some time look at the link I have highlighted The link is in Russian so for those people who can not speak Russian please be free to use the translator I found for you Thank you for your time
