Pseudoscience category 

Im assuming that this article is in the pseudoscience category because of its association with creationism  However there are modern scientificallyaccepted variants of catastrophism that have nothing to do with creationism  and theyre even mentioned in the article  I think the connection to pseudoscience needs to be clarified or the article made more general and less creationismspecific and the category tag removed entirely
