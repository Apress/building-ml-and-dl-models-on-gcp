Why every time Janjua jat is removed from articles 

I would like to bring the attentions of Wikipedia Management toward an important point when many people trying to write that they are Janjua jat this is itself a proof that Janjua are also Jat As many tribes in this world you can see like Bhutta Minhas and many more they called Jat and Rajput at the same time in different regions

I want who gave this authority to a person to remove and change the dimensions of the historical part of this world
