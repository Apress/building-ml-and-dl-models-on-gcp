Indisputable Im sorry but WP does not recognize your or any editor as having the power to declare a matter under dispute as indisputable Im disputing it based on considerable experience with PCs sold as complete PCs Im talking in particular about the models that are installed on the high tens of millions of corporate desktops in the US alone PS2 ports are like hens teeth in that environment and these machines vastly outsell motherboards sold as components or highend PCs sold to gamers 

 Re consensus it is most decidedly not a numbers game WPCONSENSUS is not based on voting but on logical arguments 
Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy

 See also WPNOTDEMOCRACY 

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system Its primary though not exclusive means of decision making and conflict resolution is editing and discussion leading to consensusnot voting

 And as for consensus vs policies see again WPCONSENSUS

Consensus among a limited group of editors at one place and time cannot override community consensus on a wider scale For instance unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right participants in a WikiProject cannot decide that some generally accepted policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope

 In short Nobody has presented a RS for your claim so it doesnt matter how many people agree with you So far your argument has consisted of a survey of specialty products from one online vendor followed by numerous instances of argument by vigorous assertion WPRS requires more than that
