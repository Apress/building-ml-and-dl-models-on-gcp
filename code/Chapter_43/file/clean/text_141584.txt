Sound Debate 

If Machine Head are to be classed by a certain subgenre of metal two things really need to happen 
1 There has to be a rationale for the classification in the Sound Debate subsection Theyve been considered for about 10 different metal genres at different times so this cant be stressed enough
2 If there is to be a rationale some form of substantiation would most definitely help Either a recognised critical opinion or perhaps even the bands own thoughts Encyclopaedias arent meant to reflect one persons particular opinion
