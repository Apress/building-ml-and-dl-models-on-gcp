I think it has little to do with embarassment but more with incredulity I tend to side with Fenice that the numbers quoted are still rather wild Are you sure there is no more conservative estimate From my own experience in clinical practice the pill does not fail very often and certainly not as often as this high Pearl index would indicate Until then theres this worry about selective quoting although you appear to be acting in good faith here   Tlk 1314 2 Jun 2005 UTC
