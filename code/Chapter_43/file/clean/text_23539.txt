Too much quoting from Barnes
While Lipstadt is used it is only as a source to quote Barnes own words There is too much of that there need to be more sources that either put his work in context how were other historians or journalists responding at the time which is finally done near the end or respond to his points More historians have written recently about the many deaths and destruction from Allied bombing and about the human cost of the expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe  not drawing the same conclusions that he did but acknowledging that these were abuses He repeated himself over and over according to the quotes here but this article should not have all these quotes for the same thing he said in 1955 1961 and 1962 or example when he does not add anything to the thought Not enough assessment by others of his thought
