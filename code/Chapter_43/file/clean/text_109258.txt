Issues about school articles
In November 2003 there was a VfD debate over Sunset High School Portland The debate was archived under TalkSunset High School Portland What to do with the article is still being contested and has been recently renominated for VfD at WikipediaVotes for deletionSunset High School Portland

I am writing to you because you have participated in such debates before There still does not exist a wikipedia policy as far as i can tell over what to do in regards to articles about specific US public school My hope is that a real consensus can come out of the debate and a real policy can take shape Take part if you are so willing  0243 12 Apr 2005 UTC
