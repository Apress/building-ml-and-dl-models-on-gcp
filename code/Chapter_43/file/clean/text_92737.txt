Most Haunted 

Im concerned about the references to the Most Haunted show in the Cultural References section First of all the host of the show was Yvette Fielding not Derek Acorah  he was one of the resident psychics Secondly it says that Derek Acorah was possessed during the programme Although possessed is in inverted commas I think it would be more accurate to say that he appeared to be possessed Acorah was supposedly possessed by some spirit every week and in fact he was later dropped from the Most Haunted shows after the team became convinced he was making things up from bits of information he overheard during filming Thirdly some of the audience say they see dark beings and other such things on the webcams every week  not just in this programme I think it really would be better to limit the Most haunted reference to the fact that it was the most watched programme on television that night as the rest of it is unsubstantiated speculation that trivialises the subject
