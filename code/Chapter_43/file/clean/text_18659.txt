Dear Resid I am sorry you disagree with my actions I did not prevent you from being able to edit your talk page in any way your block allowed you to edit your talk page and I did not protect the page please verify this from the logs of my protections for yourself and indeed I cannot see any evidence that another admin did so I have not deleted any page you created to date I am afraid I am not aware of the report on vandalism page you are referring to You can likewise inspect the log of my deletion actions to confirm that I have not deleted any pages that you created As for editing after discussing  I agree but there is no rule that states all edits must be discussed first on the talk page and indeed although I would agree on such a course of action where multiple users disagreed with a particular change it seems clear in this case it was merely you disapproved of any changes being made to the Wikiethics page whatsoever Although blanking pages is indeed vandalism the removal of text in the manner of editorial modification is certainly not vandalism You cannot simply revert changes you dislike I am afraid Wikipedia does not work like that Please take this as a lesson as I will be forced to block you again if you continue such behaviour  and considering that many other admins apart from myself have blocked you on numerous occasions eventually you may find yourself indefinitely banned by community decision I would sincerely hope an intelligent individual such as yourself would modify your behaviour to prevent such a course of action being necessary Regards   talk
