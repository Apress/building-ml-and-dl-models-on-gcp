New antiSemitism is a myth  It is not encyclopaedic to even have an article on this  It is supporting the antisemitic point of view by justifying their position that Jews deserve the persecution that they have been subjected to  This article should be wiped off the face of the planet  In spite of certain editors claiming to be Jewish whilst systematically supporting an antiJudaism point of view a much more logical explanation is that they are quite simply not Jewish  Lets run with that idea instead of supporting the nonsense idea that they might be examples of New antiSemitism
