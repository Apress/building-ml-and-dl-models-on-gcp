Too bad I really really AM a Phi Beta Kappa 40 called Group I in our School from an Ivy League College I didnt say Harvard so how did you know I guess the quality shows and you didnt speak with sarcasm but with venom derision and contempt  Moreover Dr K didnt say that what I wrote while working in response to his successive queries was gibberish  YOU did mister possessed of all your fullblown haugthiness  I told you once before that you must have been getting away all your life with demeaning people in a condescending and vituperative way BUT THAT THIS STOPS WITH ME Tough huh  I guess you just cant cope with being told off about your cross tongue and bitter attitude Neither Dr K as he as written at length nor I has any intention of working under your hegemony Thats NOT the Wikipedia way as he said  And what I wrote above were carefully documented facts regarding inter alia what Dr K did or didnt do in response to YOU doing YOUR own thing  putting everyone else down based on the written record much to your consternation I see Since you dont appear to have a decent bone in your body and lept to attack my work product as produced in the form generated by dialogue over time with Dr K I suppose I shouldnt expect you to be able to discern that that work product was not written in telegraph style for final print  sure sign of an embittered frustrated little mind and petty tyrant of an editor all too eager to prove his indispensibility  No one works with a nasty editor regardless of substance anyway Also as to substance I dont believe that Will Durants insights eg that Xenophon unwittingly prepared the way for Alexander nor those of the various other sources are reducible to a single sentence as you appear to propose although I realize that you are no respector of true scholarship especially when you didnt research it BTW you didnt answer my question what was YOUR academic standing and in what school 10814212113
