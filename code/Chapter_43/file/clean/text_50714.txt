I think theres a 5th force longterm editors who believe that they need tocancan only counter particular editing behavior by altering the policy  This is exacerbated by their apparent utter unwillingness to see that the effects of the policy they insist upon go far beyond correcting the unwanted behavior  They also are or become blind to the fact that the objections raised are due to this unwarranted and disruptive sideeffect  Actually the policy probably almost is ineffectual against any behavior the policy is invoked when the longterm editors challenge the edits  That the policy says anything about source or material types is scarcely noticed by those doing such edits  We can be virtually certain that any policy wording can and will be usedmisused by those with an agenda  Policy needs to be crafted very carefully  The overal Wikipedia policy includes Be Bold and Ignore All Rules  The overall policy was crafted very wisely

Its also true that not seeing the supposed offending edits we cant really be sure the edits were improper
