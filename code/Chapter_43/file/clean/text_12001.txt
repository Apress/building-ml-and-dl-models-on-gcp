I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other He is meaningless conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him their incoherence really means that He means nothing
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification theyd have overlooked atoms and now superstrngs  but right before that he states in principle Indeed those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologians it must bes and guesses  John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1 
 I find as arguments for Him beg the question such notions as First Cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case kake it igtheism
 Google the ignosticOckham to get others and my take on it and on the Ockham
  And I  find it underpins all atheism as one of the naturalist arguments
  Ghraham Robert Oppy  my friend   Arguing about Gods  is wrting a book on HIs attributes I hope he shhows how they are nonsnesical 
  Google skeptic griggsy to   see my threads and posts world wide Google also the problem of Heaven to see how it destrooys all theodicies as I see itGoogle the presumption   of naturalismm to  see how naturalism notes no god
  Thanks for this thread
