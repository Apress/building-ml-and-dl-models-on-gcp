The American people did know through their elected representative  Are you arguing that the Government should have no classified information  No Spies  When Congress learned about the leak they wanted to know who leaked it not the details of the program because they already knew  She is not a whistleblower   We have whistleblower laws that recognize what is whistleblowing and what is felony crime of disclosing classified information  If she wanted to just whistleblow she could have contacted her Democrat congressperson and arranged a classified briefing  She used to be Special Assistant to Clinton so she should have known how to do this  Instead she chose to leak it in an illegal way  With  all the options she had available she chose the one that would cause the most political damage to the administration   One has to wonder why   0058 24
