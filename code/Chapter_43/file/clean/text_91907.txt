Thanks but I dont have that link Im using the layout with a blue bar across the top talk and uneditable pages are yellow links are color coded and so on Ill try logging out and seeing if it appears Also on naming conventions did I make a mistake To my knowledge the programming language suffix for languages has been a longagreedapon standard I was just moving some pages to adhere to that Sorry about not using the move this page feature though Ill look again and see if it is there and I just didnt see it For the record though most of the articles I moved didnt have a history I think maybe 2 or 3 of them did but the others were only autoimported or convertion script items without a history beyond that Again sorry if I messed things up Id be happy to fix anything I break if I can figure out how Also I should probably add redirects in those blank articles  2205 Oct 20 2002 UTC
