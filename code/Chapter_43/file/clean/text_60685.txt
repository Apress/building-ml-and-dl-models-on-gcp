Hi and thanks for your work on the English Wikipedia 

I noticed an article you worked on Just a short note to point out that we dont normally link
dates

commonly known geographical terms including wellknown countrynames and
common terms youd look up in a dictionary unless significantly technical

This applies to infoboxes too

Thanks and my best wishes
