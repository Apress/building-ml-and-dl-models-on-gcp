Well the Americans ignored the UN and went to War with iraq  the War is still illegal whether Britain and the states want to admit it or not  So when the states say you can call yourself whatever you want  it does not mean much  just the Americans rewardin a small nation for supporting an illegal war with an illegal name  i am no greek lover but this site has made a big dicision to back this small slav state over the UN and EU  So let me get this straight if Iran tomorrow renames itself death to all americans and most the inhabitants back this name as does lets say another few countrieseven if the UN do not recognise it  this site will that is hilarious stop this insanity and give the page the title FYROM the legal name  If tomorrow the UN and EU says they recognise the name republic of macedonia whether it offends all of Greece tough  that should be the name  But as it stands that has not happened so why pick sides The agreed name is FYROM for a reason if everyone thought Greece did not have a point they would be laughed out of the negotiations however that is not the case the UN and EU does not recognise the name Macedonia for a reason this page does not recognise the UN cool for America  for the rest of us an insult to our intelligence
