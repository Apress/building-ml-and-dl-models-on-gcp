Problem with SieBot

SieBot is making invalid Chinese interwiki links I think because it is using the word classic instead of classical I am blocking it for 24 hours Please let me know if you have fixed it  

Another administrator has blocked it indefinitely Let me know if you need unblock when it is fixed  
The bot has been stopped I started an interwiki main namespace run from zhclassical earlier today Ill ask a coder to look into fixing this issue in pywikipediabot Please unblock SieBot Cheers
