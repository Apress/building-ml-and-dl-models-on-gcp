I did a Google Books search as well but I think the higher hit count for quadrotor is an algorithmic anomaly The number on the first page is an estimate the one on the last page is more accurate If you go to the last page of hits for each term what do you find Usually the numbers will adjust somewhat I found that quadrotor actually ended up lower than quadcopter despite initially showing thousands Are you able to reproduce that effect
