Ive had a quick look its certainly a major improvement Although 10 years old I think it would be better to use the 2001 census figures for population with an explanation that this is likely to have risen to the 2009 mid year estimates The stats in the table seem to be a mixture of the 2001 census and more recent estimates and a source next the every figure in the table seems a bit overkill and a little distracting  would it be better to just use the 2001 census and have one reference at the top of each column similar to the Somerset table I also think it would be useful to have an additional column in the table for England or Great Britain so the figures can be compared to the national averages These arent major issues  let me know what you think
