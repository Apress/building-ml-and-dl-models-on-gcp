Just looking at this a bit further what is needed is a disambig for at least this page Classical_music_of_the_United_Kingdom and Music_of_the_United_Kingdom
 The article was moved from Music of England to Folk music of england because the article as it stood dealt almost entirey with folk music The redirect is still there This was done in order to avoid removing large chunks of the original article on which a lot of hard work had obviously been put into by other users I would recommend starting a new article entiled Music of England
