Bloomington notable residents
Greetings  I see that you have added quite a few people to the list of notable residents on the Bloomington Indiana article  It seems to me that many of the people youve added are probably not actually notable enough for mention in the article while notability is a somewhat subjective concept Id suggest that as an example Keith Klein as the former program manager of WTIU is probably not a particularly notable individual and the same would apply to Jerry Yeagley soccer coach  By comparison Alfred Ryors former president of Indiana University probably is notable  You may want to read WikipediaNotability people for some suggestions  Let me know if I can be of any assistance thanks
