thank you for your input this is exactly what the article needed  The parts of the article that are being removed are not significant parts and rather are blatant negative attacks  While i agree that lying to prospective students is not correct why must negative parts be highlighted  Keep the facts and i use this word lightly with this group positive and help the school advance and produce better and more qualified physicians  Prospective students can always call up their own state board or the schools offices and ask questions  If anyone has proof that the CURRENT administration or school officials are lying to students prospective or current about possible licensure issue or charter issues or anything for that matter then yes the school should have something formally brought against them  From what i see the school has been and is currently being investigated by the GMC  Should the GMC find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away  Portraying the situation as constantly negative helps no one at all  Help correct the problem instead of being a problem Im looking at 2 of you and you know who you are and portray the positive side of things that several students despite this situation have gone on to be very successful  thank you again for impartial imput  3 August 2006 UTC
