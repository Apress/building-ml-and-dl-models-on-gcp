Ataturk and Kurds 

AW the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context It is about the things he had done in his life Not about what Kurds think of him

Lets take CocaCola for example a completely benign subject If someone said Pepsi lovers critique Coke for being too acidic sourcePepsi lovers magazine would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers It certainly is an opinion that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope Furthermore this maybe a fact its a fact that someone had this critique of coke but its not an historical event a historical fact nor is it NPOV 

Now if you apply this to Kurdish criticizms then you would get the same outcome Its all a matter of taste And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there some being offensive to Kurds Shall we include those as well

Not to mention which Kurds criticized When did they do this How many are there What are their credentials So you also have a credibility problem here

Moreover your sources cant possibly speak for all Kurds I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT

Finally it is inflammatory and controversial Yet you seem to want it in there really badly for some reason which would lead people to criticize you and come to the conclusion you are not working with the best of intentions here Correct me if I am wrong
