This reasoning by L0b0t is why I keep removing the info  This is supposed to be an overview article not a place to put every event related to the show  Technical glitches happen all the time in television and its not usually necessary to put those instances in the article  This info only if that appeals to hardcore fans of the show and not to normal readers  I would also like to cite WPOWN in that no one or group of editors owns an article and that editing by other editors is encouraged  Were all trying to help and to just revert something because someone else edited an article is pretty faulty reasoning
