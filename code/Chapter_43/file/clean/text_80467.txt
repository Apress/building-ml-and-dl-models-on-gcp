 You are hopelessly long winded Did you see the words restored and blanked Instead of moaning I suggest you learn some wiki basics like how to read an edit history No need to second guess There are thousands of user pages which noone would think of deleting and which should give you ideas Here are two at which I have looked recently userYoSoyUnHamster and userPigsonthewing Basically do not launch your user page until it is a lot more substantial   talk  contribs 1409
