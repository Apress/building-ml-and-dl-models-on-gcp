Your English is fully adequate but my Russian is not so good as your English  I value your contributions to English Wikipedia despite our disagreement  I encourage you to review my recent English Wikipedia article on ALSIB  Military secrecy during the Great Patriotic War and subsequent Cold War prevented publication of accurate information and I have been unable to find comprehensive references in English

I have a similar concern about my recent article Arctic naval operations of World War II  I cannot find enough information about Soviet summer convoys westbound along the Arctic coast from the Bering Strait  These convoys might be worthy of a separate article including their importance to aircraft fuel supplies at the ALSIB airfields  I would appreciate your review of these articles for accuracy and completeness with respect to Russian references you may find
