Youve managed to say what I tried to in far more words above  Id only add that sometimes clarity is a serious issue and forces our hand  For instance the Ainu people dont like that name and would prefer to be referred to as Utari but only they and people who study their history like myself know that name so we refer to them on Wikipedia as the Ainu It has nothing to do with us forcing some colonial name on them its just the most recognizable name   話して下さい
