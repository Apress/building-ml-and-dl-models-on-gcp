Tidy up
I am wondering This article is focussing on Rajastani exploits of rajputs but we know rajputs had kingdoms in Punjab also and if we were to include ALL such exploits for fairness then we would have an overly HUGE page In its present form its already too long and not enough elaboration on an actual rajput and the different clans We could possible include where each tribe ruled majorly in its times instead as a reference rather than an entire article within an article

Im also removing the point that no further Muslim conquests took place in the 9th century due to the formidable reputation of the rajputs as there is no proof of this from the middle eastern side to corroborate this so its more a proud assumption rather than proof I think Please feel free to correct me guys Ive also done a tidy up of language in the history section of where unencyclopedic words such as treacherously and crushed have been replaced suitably 

Can other editors help in this respect with other sections 

Looking better guys lets keep up the good work
