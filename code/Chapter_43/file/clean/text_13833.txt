Expertise I hope youre not suggesting Ive become the goto admin for topic  bans Dreadful fate Either AN or ANI would work Theoretically community topic ban proposals are supposed to go on AN because theyre not about one incident and because AN isnt archived as quickly But the preference for AN is becoming more and more a dead letter In practice proposals for topic bans are often put on ANI perhaps because it gets more traffic or perhaps sometimes because its the only admin noticeboard the OP knows about 

However The user seems to have resigned themselves to consensus and is apparently on board with the DR being closed In such a situation youre never going to get a topic ban just because theyre rude Its rather strange the way theyve been attacking you I agree but I think the best thing you can do is walk away Ive put a note on their page to urge them to disengage too    talk
