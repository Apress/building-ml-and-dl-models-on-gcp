That assumes a cladistic understanding of taxonomy doesnt it  By that standard reptiles cant be considered a group without including birds since crocodiles and birds diverged more recently than crocodiles and turtles  Mammals might have to be included as well  While understanding the order of speciation is certainly very important Im not sure why this should be assumed to trump the more standard way of classifying animals  0012 13 Mar 2004 UTC
