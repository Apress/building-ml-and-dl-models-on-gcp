Not happy 

I am not happy with the tone of this comment You seem to be confused  
Firstly are you seriously saying that as Product Manager VisualEditor team you are completely unable to give a useful answer to a question about what the plans for mathematics rendering are or what progress has been made against those plans  Does mathematics rendering really have nothing whatsoever to do with Visual Editor  Or is there some other reason why you prefer not to answer the question
Secondly if you wanted to be helpful instead of airily alluding to the volunteers who maintain that extension you might have said who they are  Who are the people to whom in your opinion I should address that question please
Thirdly if you really wanted to be helpful and I am finding it hard to avoid the conclusion that you do not you might even have volunteered to pass the question on to the approriate people rather than batting it back so unhelpfully
Once again if you engage constructively with the volunteer mathematics editor community it is likely to prove of benefit to the project  So far Im seeing less of a serious attempt to engage and too much petty pointscoring
