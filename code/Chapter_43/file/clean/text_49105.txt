You are correct about senatorelect  I did not check that and there is no reason to engage in a useless AFD  Instead I propose expanding that particular section in the Senate article Its way to short  My info on the Sec of State cosigning or to certify the governors selection is in fact valid at least in Illinois  Unless I am misunderatanding the events unfolding in my home state of Illinois which I dont think I am  Either way Ill play by your rules  I just looked up the term which I had not heard amid all this crap going on and noticed the article did not exist I thought that there should be at least some reference to the position as it will likely draw a lot of interest in the coming days   KABOOOOM
