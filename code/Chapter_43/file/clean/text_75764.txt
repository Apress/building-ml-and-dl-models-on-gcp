Attack on aimulti 

Dear Todd

I have looked at your history and you seem to be a real Wikipedia editor The person who is accused of being a sockpuppet of mine is known to me but other than that we have no connection by blood business or anything else 

The attack on every contribution I have made 107 pages covering a wide range of topics has been organised by a group called Dissident Action Group Exposed Over the years they have distributed smear letters over the internet saying I am a child molester blow up churches and other such nonsense Do a yahoo search if you doubt my word

Also look at the edit history of the two people I named They both joined within one day of each other only about 10 days ago and have made hundreds of contributions since then ALL ATTACKS ON AIMULTI

You seem a fair person so all I ask is you check out what I have said above and then act as you see fit

Wikipedia is not the place to act out personal vendettas I hope you agree
