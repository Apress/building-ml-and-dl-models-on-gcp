My current project on Wikipedia is increasing the quality and quantity of copyediting We have people who are good with AP Stylebook and Websters but we have very few people participating in article reviews who have many years of professional copyediting experience and Im wondering  why  Some copyeditors have switched jobs or are retired or arent sufficiently challenged and wouldnt mind doing a little volunteer copyediting and it would be nice to have more professionals in the mix  If youre interested in doing more great if not this is just an informal survey and Id appreciate your ideas on what would attract more professional copyeditors
