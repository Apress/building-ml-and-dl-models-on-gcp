More weasel or pov wording The paragraph beginning ICMEC found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses This entire paragraph is just a series of claims made by ICMEC not even a claim made by or supported by a neutral third party so it should be worded to reflect that We have more weasel in ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography We have sources given for this The first is invalid being a press release from ICMEC the second Rhona Schuz 2014 The Hague Child Abduction Convention A Critical Analysis AC Black pp 8283 makes no mention of at all of child pornography but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part and which according to the source resulted in little to solve the problems The third source is a strategic plan by the Hague Conference on Private International Law which again does not mention child pornography once 
The last source talks about ICMEC being involved in training law enforcement officers in Thailand about child exploitation issues This is not working with legislatures to adopt new laws So the ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography claim is actually unsourced
