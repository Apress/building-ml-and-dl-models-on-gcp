To add Shiroi if you have AIM or some way I can contact you lets discuss this further And to add from your comment on UER under the same thread cited above do not go and add the Shiroi meet to its own page or as a seperate subheader as that will require as a result pages for every meet That will be a pain to do and will not be much of an encylopedic entry
