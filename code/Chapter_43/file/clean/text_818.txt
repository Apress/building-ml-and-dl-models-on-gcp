Palmisano playing for Iowa State in the 1970s is a free pass I think Im pretty sure they were Division I then  As far as a list of coaches go Im not sure thats an articleworthy list at that level of competition as opposed to it being folded into a general Malone College Athletics article but I wouldnt file an AfD over it its a compromise anyway  Seeing as youre digging into uncovering notability for those folks want a full week for it
