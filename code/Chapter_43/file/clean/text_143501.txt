Genetic studies

A genetic study in the year 2000 in Andhra Pradesh state of India found that the upper caste Hindus were closer relatives to EasternEuropeans than to Hindus from lower castes25 However a study conducted by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in 2009 in collaboration with Harvard Medical School Harvard School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups26 The study asserts based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society and was not the product of any Aryan invasion and subjugation of Dravidian people27
