 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue By the end of the month I hope to have the main category list finished yeah it might take that long its huge At that time I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is and how to deal with the nonqualifying categories on the General Forum page
