People only Karmosen have demaned that if this article be redirected the information contained in the article has to be merged yet the linguistic information already exists False it does not already exist in the only relevant article Im aware of Cherokee language again false The only difference is that its properly formatted instead of being presented in a rather anecdotal fashion The rest of the info the first paragraph has already been included in Cherokee 

Also this statement is totally false  In addition to being a false representation of reality it also evidences intellectual dishonesty IMHO on the part of someone who did not get their way and is this point in the discussion borders on disruption
