Manfred I Lancia 

My apologies but I have been finding some definite problems with the above article which you created four or five years ago  ones which I seem unable to solve except by what amounts to original research I am hoping that you would still have your sources available and be able to do better than I can

For example in the Career section you wrote and the article still says He inherited part of the city of Loreto between Tanaso and Belbo though the current mistaken link to Loreto Marche seems to have been someone elses attempt to improve your original So far as I can see this should actually say He inherited part of the county of Loreto between the rivers Tanaro and Belbo my emphases which I believe would agree with the current Italian Wikipedia version  Eredit√≤ parte del Contado di Loreto tra Tanaro e Belbo  which however was originally translated from this English version

There are some apparent similar problems in other parts of the article where the current version of the Italian article through the distorting lens of my extremely limited knowledge of Italian again seems to read more plausibly than the English  but since the Italian editors have not cited sources for their changes it makes them impossible to use here 

If you can help out at all with this it would be useful
