WikiOnline Ambassadors 

Hi Thank you for accepting me into the Online Ambassadors program Currently I am mostly looking at the Canadian programs but will be willing to help with a few American courses if necessary Can you confirm which courses currently need ambassadors especially based on editor experience and the full process for ambassadoring the program Will I need to sign a MOU I have created my profile so please outline any further steps I need to take at this point to get involved and the timelines for realtime student editor participation Thanks Â discuss
