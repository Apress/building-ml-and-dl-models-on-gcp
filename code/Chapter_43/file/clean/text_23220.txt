Its not really a good idea for the IP to do that It wouldnt be so bad if they included the IP address  tenebris but its misleading as it stands Theres no Wikipedia user called tenebris I think it means darkness in Latin but thats based on a quick search on the web and Im hardly a Latin scholar Why dont you just ask the IP on their talk page why theyre doing it
