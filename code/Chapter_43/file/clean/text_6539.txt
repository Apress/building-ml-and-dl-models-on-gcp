Money in the Bank means you can go after any title any time any place  As Edge showed last year when as a Raw wrestler he appeared on Smackdown to beat the Undertaker for the World Title

As Wikis own article for MITB states the briefcase holdercan appear on any of the 3 shows to allow the case holder the chance to cash in

WWE has plainly stated that the case holder can pick his own spot at his own time frame to cash in

Having that case gives CM Punk the specific right to be on Raw whenever he chooses so he is given the chance to cash in if he wants to do so  That sets him apart from anybody else who pops up on Raw when it isnt his home brand
