These are sufficient sources Leave these comments and references Lifton is the most respected and published among critics If you have a problem with him then remove the text attributed to hime but dont throw the baby out with the bath water Much of my edits revolve around FBI reports Warren Commission Testimony the Zapruder Film etc Greer and the US Secret Service set the stage for the assassination of JFK Youre doing a disservice to the United States of America and the world by framing him as a driver who was slow to react The stabilized Zapruder Film clearly shows that he turned a second time to shoot JFK his Warren Commission testimony is false and the FBI report records his physical description as standard with suspects Clearly Greers role was beyond a driver Constant vigilance is attributed to him See Vince Palamaras work Dont expect any mainstream source to claim what the Zapruder film clearly showsGreer murdered JFK because the other shots were not fatal and time was running out Extract what ut you dont see as substantiated but dont revert to the driver BS
