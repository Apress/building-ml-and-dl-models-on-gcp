Im trying to tell you that the group of editors lead by Hilo are subverting policy and process with their actions Why arent you listening The tactic of creating false no consensus through spamming and irrelevant posts is causing a complete block of any attempt to improve football related articles For example the recent RFM for Sydney Derby which got shut down because of opposition spamming irrelevant comments for example by a user who claimed the entire RFM was invalid because they didnt think the article should exist in the first place Youre merely playing into their hands by blocking people trying to improve wikipedia
