And the IOC should be belived over the BOA as to the name of their team why exactly Never mind the fact that IOC page doesnt say what I asked for it merely refers to the name by the common short form Infact it uses the name Great Britain in a list of NOCs and the British NOC is called the BOA so its usable for nothing The NI sources are about the branding alone so theyre irrelevent
