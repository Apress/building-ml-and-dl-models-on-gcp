Consumer Products Section 

In the Consumer Products Section within Applications the following sentence appears

 It is also used in some data loggers to monitor handling operations for shipping containers 

Am I missing out on something do all the other good consumers have their own shipping containers Where are they hiding these  What do they do within the containers  Why the effort to conceal this from me and probably others

Maybe someone would be kind enough to move this to the Industrial section which will allow me to pretend like Im not missing out on some cool consumer application of shipping containers
