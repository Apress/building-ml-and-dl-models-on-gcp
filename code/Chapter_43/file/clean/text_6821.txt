SLR Chronology bibliography is complete

Hi MurderWatcher1 This is Paul1513 again This is to let you know that I have completed the SLR Chronology bibliography for you and that I am going to try to upload  a PDF copy to your Talk page as soon as I finish this note This may take a while because Ive never uploaded a PDF before

Youre absolutely right it would be great if some of the old Modern Photography stuff could be added to Wikipedia However you can be sure that theyre still under copyright Pre1978 American workforhire copyrights are generally 75 years 1978 and on 95 years The real question is Who OWNS the copyright today Since Modern went under there have been many media company sales and resales  the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission In fact the current owner might not even know that it owns Moderns copyrights Orphaned copyrights are a major unresolved fair use issue in the information age

Speaking of first cameras mine was a simple Vivitar 110 pointandshoot My parents gave it to me for getting straight As  in the 5th grade It was of course a bad camera but it opened up a world of possibilities From the Vivitar I eventually learned about the existence of the Pentax Auto 110 SLR It was then one step to 35 mm SLRs and I got a Nikon FE2 in 1983 The FE2 is also the reason why the bulk of my Modern Photography magazine citations begin around 1983

Im sorry to hear about your disputes with the Admins over your nonphotography Wkipedia entries It would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your Wikipedia activities over them Perhaps you could start a blog or create a MySpace or Facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the Admins want However I will respect whatever your decision is as I fully understand that the most sophisticated machine is nothing next to a human life

You can reach me on my Talk page Thanks Muchly
