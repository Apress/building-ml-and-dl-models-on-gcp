You have declared that you do this sort of writing deliberately so it is unnecessary to point out yet again that your campaign to reform English is just wrong Pretending that ITS means both the contracted form of IT IS correct and the posessive pronoun incorrect seems to display ignorance of the word ITS I suggest that you learn that English uses a full set of posessive pronouns none of which contain an apostrophe The claim you presented that spelling should be changed your way to avoid an obscure ambiguity can have no merit anyway when the result is the ambiguity that you have just demonstrated
