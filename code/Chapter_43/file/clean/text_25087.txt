Apology 

Hello 

I ask you to excuse my words but somehow I need to make clear why every ethnicity claims the right for itself to come with the truth You are a well educated person and I praise you and Inuit18 but it does not work when you keep on those Wikipedian vandals instead just ignoring them and asking an Admin to protect the article until the dispute is finished By pay them attention you force yourself to a foul Is it that worth As I already wrote I neither welcome nationalistic views and opinions from my own people nor from others which are only warm air Its our duty to nurture our children toward the truth otherwise we have to suffer in our misery we created ourself for our own Created on the basis of lies and today people day on the basis of lies Thats pure sacrifice of innocent children of Afghanistan who had nothing to do with those lies but they are the victims Why I know many Pashtuns did great damages on nonPashtuns and devided them by their varieties but in return many nonPashtuns dominate them with their cultural lingusitical superiority  Today those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan its ruling class with its royals but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the druginfected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar The same things I am writing here I always tell to my own friends and relatives Lets stop these idiocy and work together Our own hearty people will deal with our criminals and you need to do the same with yours Those who devided Afghanistan were fascists or servants of foreigners They have cost more than 50Mio people Think about it and I ask you again to excuse my harsh words
