TFD and Andy the arguments in your last post are invalid  Sourcing coverage requirements are for presence of material in the article and for the existence of an article which gun control certainly fulfills and gun politics might fulfill not for the comparison of the two words and not for talk page discussions outside of the above two     Lots of people try to do the two step process and say that it applies to all talk page discussions which is wrong and also try to create a situation of my unsourced opinion wins unless you meet the very high bar of finding a wprs that addresses and refutes my unsourced opinion  Which is what both of you are trying to do here with your assertion that the two terms are synonymous So such is invalid on several levels  Sincerely North8000
