George W Bush Intro

Whats up  In deleting some of my edits you said add info or get out of the way  I wasnt sure if the get out of the way was directed specifically at me and my Bush edits or if you were just speaking figuratively  If it was directed at me I hope you realize Im only trying to improve this article by expanding on the introduction while still keeping it concise  

The reason I listed those other topics is because the current intro only talks about the War on Terror  While thats most likely the biggest part of Bushs presidency its not the only thing that happened  I wanted to inform readers of other things that have gone on during Bushs time as president  If I were to elaborate on all of that it would make the intro ridiculously long  So I thought to list them and figured if anyone is interested they can check the rest of the article where those topics are all addressed in more detail  

Hopefully we can discuss this because I feel that the intro should accurately reflect that the War wasnt the only thing happening during Bushs presidency
