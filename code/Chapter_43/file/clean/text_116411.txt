Vivah 

Hello Zora
I spend some time at the Vivah article and took the Lage Raho Munna Bhai article as role model Could you have a look and tell me what you think  Talk2Me  PS Have you seen it Made me cringe at times but Shahid Kapoors and Amrita Raos past movies showed that they had quite some screen chemnistry IMHO
