If we look at these results in isolation then the theres no dispute that the ratio has decreased however as I said google is constantly updating google scholar with new articles in different publisher years so these numbers dont stay the same just because the year has passed Choosing a specific year range is also somewhat arbitrary if we chose to only look at 2005 to 2010 then I doubt either of us would say that the trend has shifted significantly In the same way if we expanded our search to 1990 or 1980 we might see that things go up and down over time as interest in the topic shifts and changes It may just be the case that google doesnt have access to many sources in the early 2000s that use FGC and that the ratio has always hovered between 4 to 1 or 3 to 1 and is not actually changing
