Merry England 

Re John Major  My addition may be misplaced incorrect or irrelevant however  However I am going to revert and place a link to a source of this info  I think the better way would be to improve rather than remove  I dont think its appropriate to revert though using the subjective rather than objective terms rv ie vandalism a joke or sarcastic are rather objective  I will also add a comment on the articles discussion page to ask others if they think my addition is inappropriate  Thanks
