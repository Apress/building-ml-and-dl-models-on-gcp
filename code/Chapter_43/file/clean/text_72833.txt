According to all this I think the article should have only people from Hispanic America born or naturalized in the United States Currently the article is a mess because it considers lots of people from Spain  Hispanic America as Hispanic Americans according to US definition just because they have won an Oscar or stuff like that If this article wants to be serious it should only contain Hispanic Americans born or naturalized in the United States of America
