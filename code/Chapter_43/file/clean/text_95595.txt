Thanks for your clarification Though I still feel that your addition is problematic One problem is the missing details for the citation such as author page numbers etc Another more jarring problem is that the narrative of your inserted text is quite different from the remainder of the section Your added text is quite verbose and uses a lot of direct speech without adding much additional information Note that this section is dealing with Sellers personality and his struggles in very general way and magnifying a small event like this gives it undue weight So I would urge you to consider to shorten the text and merge this detail into the section in a way that conforms to the prose and amount of detail given in the text Thanks
