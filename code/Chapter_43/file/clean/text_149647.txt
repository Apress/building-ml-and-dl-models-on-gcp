The reason why they should be in the Template namespace is so that multiple people can use them without trying to find the code on other userpages or making them just like templates for articles

 Thomas Becket 

Cyde Jimbo did not say Who will rid me of this turbulent template he just asked that people avoid using the darn things  
Seriously reverting the Christian template to an entirely different meaning isnt going to help calm things down or help to persuade people to stop using it

Perhaps it would be more useful to try to gain consensus on making T2 policy  
I concur and I enjoyed the Beckett reference  Jimbo Wales spoke of changing the culture one person at a time  He didnt recommend using less gentle methods to my recollection 

Im not committing murder here so I dont see how the allusion is appropriate
