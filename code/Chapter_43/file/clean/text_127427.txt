Wikipedia Withdrawal

To Katefan0

I have come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is no different than any other source of misinformation My intentions of contributing to the Whitman article was due to my involvement with the officer who killed Whitman and numerous victims professors witnesses and news media outlets But Alas I find myself as Gulliver lost among a few Yahoos whose intentions appear to be to their own speculation and interpretation of Charles Whitman and The University of Texas Tower Tragedy Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules in the face of facts and researched knowledge They are pedantic and callous and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level I must now reelevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject there are always those who no nothing willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions I will take away all my contributions I realize they will be reinserted for the Yahoos benefit but that will be out of my hands I would wish you good luck however you are going to need something much more powerful than luck to ever make this article correct Subwayjack
