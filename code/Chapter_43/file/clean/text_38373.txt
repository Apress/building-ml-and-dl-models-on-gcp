I love how you just undid all my work on the Eddie Brock page without asking me to change or edit Thanks so much for being considerate Unsourced original reasearch Its already sourced at the bottom of the page  do you really need me to resource it 
Its all in Amazing SpiderMan and its all characterization which is completely essential to the article whether you fail to realize that or not So you removed it stating that it could be integrated into the publication sectionIT WAS ALREADY INTEGRATED THERE BEFORE YOU REMOVED IT

Im sorry that youre upset over the removal of the material you added but part of editing on Wikipedia means that your edits may be mercilessly edited and if the material you add is found to be in violation of policy then editors required to remove it They are not under any obligation to ask your permission to do so and in general the Wikipedia community is not going to rearrange the way they do things in order to suit the demands of a newcomer Rather it is your obligation to learn the ropes here  Responding to my rather polite post above in which I complimented your work and provided links to the relevant policies in question with the message you left on my talk page which was rather rude in tone and ended with an allcaps remark which is considered the equivalent of yelling on the Net is a violation of the Wikipedias Civility Policy and is not the best way to show the community that youre willing to be a part of it

For now Ill put aside your message to me and try to explain a bit further the policies in question 

Yes Wikipedias Verifiability Policy does require that we source the material we add to articles so that readers can verify the material They cannot do this if we do not inform them of where the material comes from

The sources in question have to be reliable That means they must be considered credentialed experts in the area in question For comics examples would be sources such as Wizard magazine Comics Buyers Guide The Comics Journal Newsarama Comic Book Resources books by analysts like Danny Fingeroth and interviews on DVDs of movies adapted from comics as well as any mainstream press stories you can find

Websites whose content is usergenerated such as personal blogs forums message boards fan sites other wikis The Internet Movie Database The Comic Book Database etc are not reliable because anyone can create a blog or submit material to those sites which do not exercise editorial control over that material Exceptions to this would be the personal websites of people would be considered reliable sources in the field in question such as Mark Evanier John Byrne Peter David etc See WPUSERG which is part of WPIdentifying Reliable Sources

Similarly unacceptable is material derived from the editors own personal opinions observations or analyses which is called Original Research Adding an analytical comment to an article about a film is fine if its from a review you cite by Roger Ebert Adding such a comment when the observation comes from the editor who adds it is not Some editors point to the primary material in which the narrative is found but the primary sources such as an issue of Amazing SpiderMan only contains the narrative itself it does not contain any analysis of it Material is not quoted or paraphrased directly from a source but which constitutes an analysis or observation derived from it is called synthesis which is a form of original research The bottom line the need to ask Who is the person making the observation If its the editor its simply not permitted

The website you cited in your revert is not a reliable or verifiable source not only because it is a fan site but because it doesnt even mention any of the material you added It simply lists issues of the books You cant just point to books and say Its all in Amazing SpiderMan The original stories might be but comments like The key difference between Brocks heroism and Peter Parkers mainly being are not

As for the remaining issues
As far as the issue of integration is concerned the analysis by Mike Conroy does not deal with the issue of characterization so I added it to the Lead where such summarytype analyses can go The material on Paul Jenkins run belongs in the Publication section alo
