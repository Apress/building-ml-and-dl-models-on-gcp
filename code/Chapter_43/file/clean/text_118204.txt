Copyright of FT logo 

Rather than going ahead and changing the copying on the FT logo graphic from PD to logo I thought I should ask you if you know if it  has been released into the public domain which seems unlikely but maybe it has lapsed or something If it is not known to be in the public domain someone should change it to logo
