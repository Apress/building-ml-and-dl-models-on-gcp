please research into feminist periodicals on superiority 

Feminist newspapers and booklets may have reported quoted or published wellknown feminists as proponents of superiority or supremacy likelier the former particularly in the late 1960s and the 1970s Many such papers had largely local circulation in various locales with some copies arriving nationally and some are available now in microfilm in libraries at least Bell  Howell published Herstory Womens History Collection microfilm Best wishes and thank you very much   

 please research What Women Wanted in Stanford Observer 

A specific source on superiority that I dont have is Freedman Estelle B What Women Wanted Varieties of Feminism in NineteenthCentury America in The Stanford Observer Jan 1978 perhaps pp 3  7 The Stanford Observer published by Stanford University  since renamed Stanford Magazine or The Stanford Magazine newsstanfordedu which is cited in Offen Karen Defining Feminism A Comparative Historical Approach in Signs Journal of Women in Culture and Society vol 14 no 1 Autumn 1988 p 125 n 12  139 n 43 pp 8  22 respectively in PDF viewer software JStor or JStors stable URL both as accessed Aug 28 2010 248p author was of Institute for Research on Women and Gender Stanford Univ While Stanford Universitys library probably has this on hand it appears to be rather costly to get a copy and as far as I know after checking WorldCatorg no copy is near me I hope someone has a copy and can edit the Wikipedia article accordingly It is also very possible that the superiority referred to has nothing to do with women governing whole societies but perhaps is only about a moral biological or essentialist claim to superiority and not governance Best wishes and thank you very much   

 please find critiques of supremacy generally 

Criticisms of the superiority or supremacy position are implicit in most equality claims but they probably should be articulated At the moment I dont think I have them except for what Ive already added to WP plus some to come on matriarchy Preferred are two kinds those by feminists theres probably a passage in an interview of or an article by Betty Friedan for example and those by antifeminists although some likely exaggerate and conflate all of feminism with superiority aspirations and object to the whole rather than state a specific objection to superiority per se Best wishes and thank you very much    Corrected the syntax of the first sentence to conform to that of the next sentence 

 whether Les Guérillères community intended as relatively modern 

I think Monique Wittigs Les Guérillères the 1969 novel was meant to be relatively modern or futurist and thus so was the proposed female state This is suggested by the words rifle and bullet in the novel Wittig Monique trans David Le Vay Les Guérillères 1985  1969 op cit cited in the draft p 141 rifle  p 132 bullet  bullets in contrast to an existing interpretation of the fiction as Amazonian probably meant in a sense other than ancientness The ages of the English words rifle and bullet about 23 centuries per Shorter Oxford Eng Dict 4th ed could be irrelevant if her original French words whatever they were were old enough and meant ancient weapons or weapon supplies used for war To avoid this factor being deprecated as original research from a primary source is there a secondary source about the feminist states intended time frame other than 1969
