Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five stolen Canadian passports because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didnt he testify that he hadnt paid a visit to Khaldan for years  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camps management team  But if the camp had been a college I think his roles would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order and officially informs them that they have been admitted  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training  And once they finished their training he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia during the civil war there  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp  His location was a secret for four years  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April by human rights workers who conducted an initial interview with him  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pretorture versions  of what the camp did
