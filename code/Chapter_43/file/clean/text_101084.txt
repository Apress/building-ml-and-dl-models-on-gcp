Since retiring from Wikipedia I have been looking at my life as objectively as I can and it has become obvious that my time on Wikipedia demonstrated the serious flaws in my personality and so I have deleted the contents of this page I can only apologize to the countless people whom I have damaged especially as I now realize I was acting out of a deepseated feeling on inadequacy and a desire to be accepted by others In hindsight it was obvious that I was simply a tragic little girl who wanted to make her mark on the world I have grown since then and realized my errors Please forgive me
