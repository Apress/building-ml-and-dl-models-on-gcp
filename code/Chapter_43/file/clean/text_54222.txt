I was trying to make a point with the BBC comment not being entirely literal Taking the criticisms more literaly
The links to Zeoh archiveorg and any other video hosting sites are provided because they are links to the actual literal subjects in question so the reliability of the host itself is irrelevant I would liken this to having a wiki about Polar Bears a link to which makes an actual real life Polar Bear appear next to you for verification

Any reference to legocom or any other corporate site is provided as verification of claims to official connection with said corporate body The site of said corporate body is therefor the best only reliable online source for verification

And as for IMDB youve obviously never tried adding an entry to IMDB That sht takes weeks

Im sure anyone interested would gladly add better citation than that present if you would suggest something
