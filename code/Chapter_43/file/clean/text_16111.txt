The alledged reason for the block was Sigismont you still have not showed that the 10 commandments was the only thing commanding to Moses the rest of the pentatuch was also from Moses

Im sorry not I but the German Reform rabbis said that circumcision was not ordered to Moses so backing their rejection of circumcision upon the absence in the Ten Commandments of the one given to Abraham
This is mere truth so that once again the block was of total bad faith
