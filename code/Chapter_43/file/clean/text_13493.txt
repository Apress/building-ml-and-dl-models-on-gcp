Dont Thank me just yet It may sound like Im dissing you simply because you failed to see things my way if thats what you think I really dont care 

I am civil I kept trying to ask them to help me but they just kept insulting my intellegence and pushing away refusing to cooperate Instead of kindly correcting my articles andor contributions they just quickly deleted them Do you know how irritating that is 

I already pointed out to you that Treelo was breaking no rules however ever since they gave me attitude for my kindness I just feel like they are stalking my wareabouts waiting for me to screwup and delete ANYTHING I do then come back here and parade it around in my face knowing I cant do much about it because they arent breaking any rules

Surely you knoow how irritating THAT IS Its called injustice and I for one AM NOT going to let myself go down like that I know there are people more experienced out there than me or users who are just beginning but that doesnt mean they have to gang up on the freshmen users mercilessly when they make a mistake

Instead of deletion I suggest replacement additions Dont just run through everything deleting words and paragraphs that you see arent right Take time from your ohsobusy schedule and correct mistakes by chaining words together correctly EDITING if you will You want to continue going about the way you have because you either think they should learn as you have or you dont want to make time or some other thing Make no mistake about that

Ive already come to understand the point of view policy I follow it best I can so closely that it can only be ones point of veiw themselves that they are reading the writers point of veiw and I cant help that I never threatened Treelos life Please copy and paste or retype the sentences where I said that if you still think so

I also dont really tolerate sarcasm very well on THIS paticular website So please type your words straight and I take it the column was in the correct place
