My concern about your username Heavybuddha

Hello  and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome but I noticed your username and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedias username policy After you look over that policy could we discuss that concern here

Id appreciate learning your own views for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern

You have several options freely available to you
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here I can stop worrying about it
 If the two of us cant agree here we can ask for help through Wikipedias dispute resolution process such as asking for a third opinion or requesting comments from other Wikipedians Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username Visit WikipediaChanging username and follow the guidelines there

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I dont think your username is grossly blatantly or obviously inappropriate such names get reported straight to WikipediaAdministrator intervention against vandalism WPAIV or blocked on sight This is more a case where opinions might differ and it would be good to reach some consensus  either here or at WPRFCNAME So I look forward to a friendly discussion and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia Thank you again   Talk
