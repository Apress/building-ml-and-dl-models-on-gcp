YOU WERE RIGHT 

Thank you for your intervention in the Eucharist article You had no reason to be sorry you were right the first time according to Prodego
The WP3RR does not require the same editor to be reverted only the same content     talk 

My footnote amplification was deleted four times by LooieLima That is a clear 3R violation by Prodegos definition  Also Lima has unilaterally redirected History of the Eucharist from Origin of the Eucharist and tried to make a distinction between the two

Im grateful for any time you have spent on this up to now and thank you in advance for any future attention
