Adoption Template 

Hi there am also available to adopt

I have removed the Adoptme template from your user page as you have been offered adoption by an Adopter and not been active since adding the template This has been done to help to decrease the load at CategoryWikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adoptauser 

If you feel that none of the users that have contacted you so far meet your needs then please add back the Adoptme template Also feel free to contact me
