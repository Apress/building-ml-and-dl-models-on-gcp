Hi I oppose your grounds for removal personal opinions are what talk pages are for but I think that they could almost be legitimate targets since the discuss the events not the article 

its an encyclopedia In other words talk about the article not about the subject

please consider at least leaving a note about them and a link to the correct place in the article history
