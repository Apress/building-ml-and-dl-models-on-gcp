Apple likes to pretend that the idea for Dashboard came from Deskaccessories but there is almost no similarity between the two  The implementation of Dashboard uses much more similar technologies to Konfabulator and they look almost identical  I mean if Desk Accessories were written in a markup language of some sort had polished and shiny graphics ran all the time whether they were being shown or not and looked just like Konfab or Karamba then they might have a point but none of those things are true
