And what kind of mistakes are these And which editions of the Guiness Book are these found in Who ranks the credibility of these websites Most of them seemed to be articles whats to have stopped some of them from using information from other articles or perhaps say used the number cited from wikipedia itself Anyways leaving that side let me know which editions from the Guinness Book they have made errors in and what they were I can understand the editors of the Guinness Book can make a mistake but its difficult to say they could have made a mistake in reading a statistic that says 100000000 and writing it down as 65000000 instead
