Calling this an Israeli victory is very subjective and I think it makes this article quite POV especially since most sources used to supposedly verify this claim are either Israeli or very proIsraeli The Palestinians actually gained ground in the second intifada just think of the Israeli military withdrawl and settlement evacuation in Gaza which went from Israeli occupation to the control of these same groups which fought Israel during the second intifada and supposedly lost Also Israel gained nothing out of this war infact they were only forced to make concessions and it was a PR disaster So how was it a victory
