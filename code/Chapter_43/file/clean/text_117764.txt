Offley Place 

Hello  informed me that you were asking some questions about why the article you wrote Offley Place was speedy deleted As I am the administrator who deleted it Ill give you some brief rationale according to Wikipedia conventions and policies Im glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future However the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations
It did not contain any verifiable thirdparty references
It was written in a promotional rather than an encyclopedic tone 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article you had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject That is it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia

Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia we hope that you will continue as an editor here For more information about Wikipedia policies and guidelines I suggest you take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia If you have any more questions please feel free to let me know on my talk page

Cheers
