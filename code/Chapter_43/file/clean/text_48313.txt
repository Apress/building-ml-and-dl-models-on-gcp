Eichenwald

One thing that caught my attention when I read the NYT article was the claim that Justin gave his customer records to the Times and they checked the 1500 pedophiles and found they were from all walks of life  Now at the time Justin shut down his porn operation he was a legal adult and was running a web site indistinguishable from any other pay adult site replete with the required notice that All Models are over 18 years of age records on file  Does that mean that anyone who paid for access to that Web site with a credit card got lumped in with the people who paid Justin for webcam performances when he was 14  This is the kind of shoddy agendaladen reporting typical in these cases  Does anyone remember when the US government busted an age verification service because two web sites that used their codes located in foreign countries had underage material on them  They then characterized everyone whod bought an age verification code as people who had paid for access to child porn and shopped the customer list around to a bunch of other countries for sting operations

Any reporting on alleged child porn in the US suffers from a number of problems most notable of which is the fact that even journalists are legally prohibited from looking at the material in question to report to readers whether its content is being lied about  Its basically a situation in which you can write anything no matter how outrageous about international pedophile rings and luring and poor little abused children and it will get published with no factchecking and in an environment in which no one can be publicly suspicious about its claims for fear of attracting negative attention to themselves

I havent seen a single article in the mainstream press in the last ten years on the subject of child porn that wasnt deliberately inflammatory dripping with valueladen terminology and full of deliberate lying by omission juxtiposition and innuendo  Mr Eichenwalds relationship with Justin Berry clearly violated almost every rule of objective journalism  Given that the NY Times article is a single source for the entire Justin Berry story basing an encyclopedia article solely on that article and on derivative journalism generated by it is an example of truthiness not factiness
