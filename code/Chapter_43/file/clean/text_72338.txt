OK then please explain why a page about a newspaper called the Antelope Valley Press is more notable than a page about a newspaper called the AV News when BOTH publications cover the same area of Los Angeles County Why are you allowing them to stay up As for the pasted and deleted content after my first attempt to create the page was deleted I thought there might be a format issue so I copied the entire AV Press page as a template and then REPLACED ALL OF THE TEXT ABOUT AV PRESS with the text about AV News and the website link thinking that would resolve the issue As for my use of our that was my outrage and having a page deleted almost as it was posted and I should have worded it better I do not work for the AV News but I was asked to see about getting the page up by others who think people looking at wiki should be aware there are more media outlets in the area than AV Press I am not sure what other references you need other than the bloody website Perhaps you could can the headupyourass attitude and give me an example or two of what the lord god almighty Bwilkins finds acceptable

SO heres the question Is wiki about getting information out or playing favorites How much does AV Press donate for such wonderous exclusivity here Because I simply do not see any other reasonable explanation why AV News keeps getting deleted
