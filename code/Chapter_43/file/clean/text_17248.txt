We are thus both right re the meaning but that big water meaning came from that arm waving thing so I dont take any notice of it  The Aboriginal people were trying to warn my lot to not camp on the river flats because of the big water arm waving here to try and get them to understand re floods that happens and killed at least 89 out of 200 people in 1852  Track goes down there is the same as boss track  Moorum means track  beeja means boss  Boss track  Main track  Main fault line  Rivers form within fault lines many times  I live directly above it  the Ancrestral channel before he changed course  so know it
