Thanks I am only working on animals now too so it would already be great to have the animal bot Do you need a long time to write the other kingdoms you think
I cant write it but I can see some things in the file  if your bot makes links to Scientific classification Ill be able to change it into Wetenschappelijke classificatie I guess the main difference between nl and en in this case is that we dont use Taxobox section binomial at all but always Taxobox section binomial parens I guess you have somewhere in the code to change Taxobox section binomial simple into Taxobox section binomial or Taxobox section binomial parens I think Ill be able to change that kind of things
