Wrong picture A contemporary illustration of a soldier of the Kings Regiment dated 1742 

This picture from the Cloathing book of 1742 is a depiction of a soldier of colonel Reads Regiment numbered 8th Regt of Foot in the Book but since 1750s it was known as 9th Foot
The Kings Regiment Colonel Onslows Regiment in 1742 was numbered 9th Regt of Foot in the Book but later it became 8th Foot It had blue facings being one of the Royal Regiments of the British Army
So correct picture of 8th Regt is here httpdigitalgallerynyplorgnypldigitaldgkeysearchdetailcfmtrg1strucID293335imageID477275total111num20parent_id293136wordsnotworddcfk0sScopesLevelsLabellwordlfieldimgs20pos29snumew
