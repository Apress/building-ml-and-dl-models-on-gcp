escape orbit yeah I did that on purpose It looks like I am going to have to be uncivil to you because you are not getting my point otherwise Simply put you are a moron Yes you were being uncivil to me by assuming that I said because I want it in I never said that Thats how morons think and hence this description for you Your tone has been at least as combative as you think mine has so you are the one who needs to calm down Wikipedia editing actually isnt for you
You obviously dont know quite how 3RR works If someone reverts more than 3 times in the same days worth of time then they have broken 3RR Not until then
You guys may not be on the same exact team but you claim consensus despite that Im not part of that as one of the editors in the dispute You still have not answered why you guys in that supposed consensus have gone deeper than you were already satisfied with before Perhaps I should ask the one who is doing it most recently fakesmile In fact even he or she is editwarring now Just because shes part of your consensus doesnt mean shes not editwarring So theres that issue too

Okay  when you first started your reversion junk here even you would only revert to the point of where escape orbit left the stylized as ebay in place without the old version Go back up and look at his bullets here and then look at your reversions All of you who were doing those early reversions in your little group that you called consensus were originally only reverting to the point of leaving the mention of the current style in the lead according to the earlier discussion here Originally you guys were only saying that mentioning the former style in the lead was too much for you so you didnt erase them both Why are you guys erasing them both now even though the original concern was only against the old one
