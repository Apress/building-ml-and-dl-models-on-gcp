FileMasada Northwest Panoramajpg 

Unless I am mistaken something is seriously wrong with the description of this file and with its caption information at Dead Sea and Masada  Facing northwest from Masada one is facing away from the Dead Sea which is to the east Distant Jordan could not be in the foreground only the background  Please make all necessary corrections in the two articles and the file itself
