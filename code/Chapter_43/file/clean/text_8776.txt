Opera for Devices 

I disagree with the way the Wii and DS get their own sections like they belong with the other major Opera versions the Devices site has changed since I last brought this issue up now showing only the Wii since it is their primary focus but both the Wii and DS should fall into an Opera for Devices category the site previously showcased a number of other devices that use it including the pepper pad archos and formerly the internet tablets the entire list of them is still up
