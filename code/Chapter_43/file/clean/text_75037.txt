Again as Ive already pointed out doing a theme summary of Hamlet is really no different from doing a character list  The themes of Hamlet are in Hamlet the same as the characters of Hamlet are in Hamlet  It isnt complicated the way some people try to make it  And there is no original research in simply doing a theme summary any more than there is original research in doing a character list  Are you going to look at some book by Harold Bloom to find out whether Polonius is in the play because otherwise you cant tell  That would be nonsense of course  The same is true of the themes of the play  The source for all the themes of Hamlet is Hamlet  That is a fact  And I have no idea where people are getting their strange and eccentric ideas of what a theme is  Some people who have posted here need to go to MerriamWebster online and look up the word theme  A theme is a motif a recurring idea  That is factually what a theme is  look it up  A final point is it too much to ask that words should be spelled correctly in the article  Look at whats there now  soliloquy is misspelled cemetery is misspelled  It looks terrible and its embarrassing  Please before you post something just copy the text over to a text editor and run a spelling check on it since there doesnt seem to be a spell checker here  Its great that people want to contribute but passersby who see the article with all those misspelled words are going to sneer and say that Wikipedia is crap  Nobody wants that  

Why was the original theme summary deleted I suppose that section could be thought of as a starter to the more broader literary critisism section but please explain why
