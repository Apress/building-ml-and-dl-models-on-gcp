Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article this was promptly reinserted by another user  The text is Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system According to the international data reported by Freedom House the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East consisting of a multiparty system and separation of powers 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it

1 The very same text  verbatim  is repeated later in the article  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies obviously a wellwritten article cannot be repetitious

2 A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a valuejudgment    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved see point 3 below  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction  Commonsignificant views about political rights are much better dealt with less tersely under the Government heading I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom so if you disagree with me deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of any country article

3 Where the very same text appears in the Government section it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint which the authors of this section thought was equally significant Conversely the research group Minorities at Risk MAR characterizes Israels system   This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians  Indeed Id like to ask does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints maybe because the Freedom House statement is incontrovertible or whatever and if so why did heshe not remove the Minorities at Risk comment from the Government section

4 The text is a quote from Freedom House which is widely regarded as a USlead organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme  The Times hardly a fringe opinion has described it as an outpost of American soft power   Unlike say the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports  Giving its views such decisive prominence  treating them as the bottomline on the countrys political status by placing them in the opening  seems unencyclopaedic  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this I should remove the offending text from the introduction  Theres presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section as it currently is  as well
