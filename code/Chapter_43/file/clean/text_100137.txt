Im not sure thats the example you meant the diff shows a Defendent  Defendant change Defendent is either a typo or a Briticism and shouldnt be used in reference to a US legal case where the term of art is Defendant and wed only capitalize it like that in titles of cases  There are lots of things in MOS I loathe but Compass_points isnt that troublesome to me  At worst it seems to generate unnecessary RM discussions sometimes and some editwarring over northeast vs northeast I think it should explicitly crossreferences WPENGVAR there  Compass points shouldnt be capitalized unless in a proper name      ʌⱷᴥⱷʌ
