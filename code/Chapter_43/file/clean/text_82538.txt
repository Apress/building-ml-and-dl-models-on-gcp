Dear Natalie
First duly noted and it has been on my mind since an earlier flag appeared  My effort at footnoting ran amuck when I was simply stumped by the wall which kept me from doing it
I shall shortly dedicate my efforts to better learning the Wikimethodology and hold back on contributions until I am on top of that
For example when the WSJ Wall Street Journal reports a press release from the National Home Builders Association NHBAI would assume that correctness would require me to navigate to the NHBA website for the proper reference
Am I correct  I will try the signature thing with this message
