We dont link to userpages from articles It doesnt matter if the link will become legitimate after a day or a year we just dont do it The rest of my comments are relevant because its unlikely that Nintendo Nightmare will ever warrant an article I dont need to play the game to search for reliable sources as required by our notability guidelines In fact I just looked for sources and found nothing Youre right that the game can generally serve as a source for the plot but we still require additional sources for everything else which should be the bulk of the article Keep in mind that were not here simply to repeat the plot or provide a walkthrough but to provide details on the history and development of the game concept and themes summarize its reception by critics and so on Without sources to give us that information and meet our notability guidelines we should not have an article on the subject Cheers
