Comment Thats been my understanding as well In case after case editors argue and editwar over subjective terms such as mixed or universally acclaimed the later even when the universal is not 100 None of these subjective interpretations help the reader But if the reader sees that RTs aggregation says this and MCs aggregation says this and reads a sampling of critics quotes beneath that then a reader can make up his or her own mind And we even offer the CinemaScore audience view to give them an even more wellrounded picture We dont need to open with a claim thats subject to debate We need to just give the facts
