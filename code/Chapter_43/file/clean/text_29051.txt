Lo and behold we have yet ANOTHER administrator openly flouting policy with no fear of reprisal or disciplinary action against him Im starting to see why Willy On Wheels does what he does Not that i endorse his actionsi just dont blame him for being wrong about it Cyde seems to think since hes an admin everything he chooses not to like can be Speedied and it will go through with little resistance due to his connections high above You not only do NOT have a neutral point of view but i think you are nothing more than a troll to cause hell on wikipedia for your own amusement Well i think its time his cushy ride ends Time to start voting KEEP for all of our beloved Templates fellow wikipedians He claims to not stile freedom of speech but he clearly does so Im putting a Totally disputed template on his page until further notice I think its also time that Jimbo Wales sees the utter chaotic mess that the adminstrators have made Wikipedia And just to make myself very clear i do NOT assume good faith anymore I assume hostility until proven otherwise Im sorry I USED to be very kind but after a few years of idiocy like this i have lost my tolerance and patience for this      0423 16
