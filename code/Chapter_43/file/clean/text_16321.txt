Your meddling immigrant confusion 

I have a source here that explains the ethnic origins of American Founding Fathers

That being said Rhenish Germans were the sort we had in those days  Prussians and Austrians as well as their politics did not constitute part of the Founding Fathers vision or hope of the future for America  Youll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the Habsburg or Hohenzollern except perhaps Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben politics in any way were an inspiration for Americans of any or all origins then and now  We have had emulation of William van OranjeNassau and Prince Rupert of the Rhine including his family such as the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia but that is because they were Rhenish and any other Palatine Amish etc like Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower culture we pretty much supported always and for all times  Thats different from the East German culture which has never ever been a component of Americana and might never be either  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face  You have to put the German issue in context Benjamin Franklin was hostile to Palatine Boors as he called them but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death  You are looking for an inclusivity that only exists in the media including revisionist history books attempting to supplant our identity with subversive principles
