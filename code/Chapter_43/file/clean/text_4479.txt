Trevithj   The reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention setpoints errors and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market  The remarks of Black are perfectly clear and also make  no mention of these factors nor do his patents They are understandable as he intended them the use  of feedback bypasses  the  inadequacies of the nonlinear variable and uncontrollable properties of the largegain open loop amplifier as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closedloop gain to be set at 1Î² as fixed by a resistor divider for example by making the closedloop gain independent entirely of the openloop gain I dont think you fully appreciate the simple algebra that governs this circuit
