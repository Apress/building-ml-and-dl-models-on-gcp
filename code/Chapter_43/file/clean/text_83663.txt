Okay dug a little deeper and I think Ive figured out what happened more or less Fremantle forfeited their games against Centrals and Rovers in protest to what they called poor umpiring by a Mr Croft in their previous game against Rovers which caused them to drop to third on the ladder The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers not really a grand final as it was still part of the regular fixtures which resulted in a draw 410 WP to 47 R  Im guessing behinds werent counted at this stage Also I think this comment pretty much confirms it Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership Really they have themselves to blame for the schoolboyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr Croft which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in Very interesting reading and thats my historical research finished for the day  A
