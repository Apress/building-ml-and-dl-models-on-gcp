Mentone Grammar School 

So who are you anyway mate  Was just wondering why you keep reverting the page back  In our opinion and if you read the papers around the time of the occurrence in question The Age Leader Herald Sun youll find more than enough info to show that the majority of the school really was against the changes and something to that effect at least should be allowed to be included  The school has also gained notoriety of late for being sued by a parent of a former student for breaching their duty of care in failing to educate their son correctly  Come on mate I know the previous edits are a bit rich but seriously the school is a shambles and this is fact I promise i wont do it again now that im on my last warning but if you are going to be the gatekeeper you should know that the school is in deep trouble
