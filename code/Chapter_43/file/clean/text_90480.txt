On the official OC Transpo iPhone app route 94 scheduled to Woodroffe are shown as arriving at Nepean Woods 1A and trips from Woodroffe are shown as departing from Nepean Woods 2A The bus destination signs say Woodroffe via Fallowfield and the OC Transpo website says Woodroffe so Im actually unsure whether to put Woodroffe or Nepean Woods as the terminus However I do know a new park and ride lot is supposed to be constructed soon in that general area which could mean Nepean Woods is the name of the new park and ride  talk
