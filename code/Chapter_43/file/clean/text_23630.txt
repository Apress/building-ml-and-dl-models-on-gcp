Corporals_killings
I assume from your edits that you have edited on WP before under another name However should this not be the case I would respectfully point out that the lede in a WP article should normally encapsulate the article In the above article the subsequent passages make clear that the killings of these corporals resulted in successful murder prosecutions Since WP strives to use a neutral point of view  NOT bowdlerised language or mealy mouthed euphemisms  I have reverted your change of murder to killing 

It may be reprehensible but folks would also take you more seriously if you responded on these your talk pages and completed some details on your user page rather than keeping it blankkiwiexile at DMOZ   

Murder is not neutral Also I dont appreciate your tone  

What exactly dont you like about my tone 303kiwiexile at DMOZ   

Is Brixton Busters really a new editor
Thread moved here from another user talk page so the subject of speculation can respond if he wishes to

I do not like your tone manner or attitude to relatively new users as you did here  should you continue in such an argumentative and unwelcoming way I will report you to admin Wikipedia should be welcoming to new editors  
Do you have any evidence that this is indeed a new editor and not just 303 abusing the right to vanish Personally Im glad 303 is back since hes always been a hard working and productive editor but he hardly needs your unnecessary protection since its obvious that hes an accomplished Wikipedian from day onekiwiexile at DMOZ   
And what evidence do you have not to AGF  There are 3000000 people who have contributed to wikipedia If indeed 303 has returned on what basis do you make an accusation of abusing a right to vanish  He left in good standing and would therefore not be evading a ban or block Keep your speculations to yourself please  
Considering that you banned me for two consecutive periods of 14 days after speculating that I was a sock puppet of a retired German I think Ill ignore your advice Tyrenius Just look at the text spelling mistakes and context of UserBrixton Busters first edits and tell me again that I should assume that this is a genuine new editor

There was absolutely nothing wrong with Gaimhreadhans tone in the referenced diff he was respectful and discursive Frankly Domer48 you are continuing with the same insulting behaviour you use elsewhere I am just composing my responses to the Arbcom you are disrespectfully ignoring by bulkediting the Great Irish Famine article and I will also be drawing to their attention this disgraceful and harassing comment you just made  

Im going to move this thread to User talkBrixton Busters where that brand new editor can then comment on whether they have recently edited on WP using a different user name If the references to 303 are summarily removed again I will take it as a strong confirmation that my assumptions made on the basis of textual and contextual analysis are correct

I dont see anything wrong with letting bygones be bygones what would be wrong is giving an experienced and knowledgeable editor now using a different user name the same latitude and licence we would give a newbie

I think it would be very helpful at this early stage for kiwiexile at DMOZ   

I think this is completely inappropriate behaviour I feel we should apologise to UserBrixton Busters  for this seemingly irrational behaviour for an experienced editor who kno
