Dimitri  Nina 

Well thank you so much for your reply I hoped you would About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP and decided to do something about it I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre  Lavelle so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them but I didnt Since Im something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England from where it has spread all over the world 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem I kept seeing references to Pierre but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP I still dont have enough for Lavelle With difficult cases I start a Word file offline Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely Even these personal pages

Ive got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time including both Dimitris books and Pierres book I dont know where you are of course but if you are somewhere in England we might arrange to meet and you could have a look at the books It sounds as though you dont have a copy of his first book

Ive tried to interview all the survivors from that time So far Ive only found two Id certainly like to meet your father if he was willing Hes bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us And Ill answer more fully about myself but not on WP for reason given above

Now Im going to let you have my email address If you wish you could send me an email which would automatically give me yours Then once you know your email has worked please wipe off my eaddress from this page after youve stored it preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use open machines without good security get scanned regularly Here goes inmanrosshotmailcom
