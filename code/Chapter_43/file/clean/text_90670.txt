Apparently other editors agree that the edits I made were justified  A group of meatpuppets working as a team to revert an article to their own POV is what has caused this block  At issue was the advert tag which is justified was placed on the article by one editor replaced by me replaced again by another editor and replaced again by me  Three editors so far have indicated the tag belongs there  Im sure a forth editor is going to weigh in on this side too  The article is riddled with brochure language  Please note that I was removing brochure language right up to the lockup of the article  Theres still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed  Additionally I dont believe I broke the 3RR rule which requires a fourth reversion
