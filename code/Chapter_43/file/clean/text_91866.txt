CSPAN FAC 

Hi there Nikkimaria Thanks for your review of the images on the CSPAN article and Ive responded to your comment on the FAC page If you were willing to go in and make the change you suggested I would really appreciate it in case you didnt see my disclosure on the FAC page I am a consultant to CSPAN and I refrain from all direct edits to the mainspace when I have a financial COI This is in keeping with Jimbos advisory to COI editors as explained in his  to stick with Talk pages and find consensus for changes Even though this change would be very simple and noncontroversial I still would like to follow his wishes If youre unable to make this improvement I can reach out to another editor about this Cheers  Talk
