By the way I would like to point out Nick made a mistake in his own original lyrics in this performance

which should say  My GOOD hand tattooed EVIL across his Brothers fist and those filthy five did nothing to challenge or resist

So you can hopefully now understand  when he says  My killing hand called EVIL bears a wedding band thats good it has been a long suffering shackle collaring my REBEL BLOOD
