Founded when 
Im confused
The Washington Times article says that the company was founded in 2000 with Lance Buttiglieri
The original Shocker Toys website About page said that Buttiglieri joined the company in 2004
The Record article says that the company was founded in 1998
This interview httpwwwcomicreaderscommodulesphpnameNewsfilearticlesid803 says 1999
The Shocker Toys website About page now says 2000
Another interview httpmurdershownet20080630geoffbeckettofshockertoys says 2000
And another interview httpwwwcomicbookbincomshocker01html says 1999 again
This sayshttpwwwalibabacommembershockertoysaboutushtml 2004 as an LLP
This press release httpexpresspressreleasenet25Shocker20Toys20Heralds20In20The20Age20of20the20Independent20Comicphp says that Shocker Toys LLP was founded in 1999
This article httpwwwpoeghostalcom2008035questionswithgeoffbeckettofshockertoyshtml states Shocker Toys was registered in 2001
From the same site different article httpwwwpoeghostalcom200802thesagaofshockertoyshtml its back to being founded in 2000
This wiki article alone has 2 different founding dates 1998 and 2000

This is very basic information  All of it comes from Geoff Beckett directly through press releases interviews or his own website  Why do the dates keep changing  Can any information provided by a citation that has Beckett as its primary source be considered reliable when he changes his story constantly about something as simple as this  What is the policy of dealing with information that comes from a person who just doesnt get things right very often  From the numerous announced release dates that have come and gone with no actual product materializing to not even getting the founding date of his own company correct it seems that Geoff Beckett should be considered at least somewhat unreliable whenever he states anything    And so can references like the  Washington Times and The Record articles be considered sound when they are going off nothing more than what Geoff Beckett is telling them
