I just want to thank you for your efforts on this article   There are a number of people on Wikipedia that go to any length to criticize lawyers  Maybe sometimes with good reason  Often with no good reason  It was lawyers that finally exposed the coverup of asbestos  I just wish it had occurred much earlier than it did  Today our family finally received a small settlement from BabcoxWilcox   TWENTY FOUR years after my dad died from mesothelioma and two years after my mother died  Frankly I had forgotten about it   Im sure my mother would have wished her last 20 years to have been with her husband  I know I missed having a dad   Was that worth 50000  Not on your life  All that did for me is bring back memories and the kind of grief that has never gone away  Not even after 24 years
Please dont stop contributing information on these issues   The history of asbestos is or should be a cautionary tale of what happens when we believe corporations will self regulate out of their own self interest   Ayn Rand was not a historian  She was a fiction writer    It is a shame that some people do not seem to understand the difference
