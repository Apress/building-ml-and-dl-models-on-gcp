Sabine I very much disagree with your view of economics

At the top I just expressed myself in a fun sort of way

John Quiggin feels he has the right to censor my funny way of saying I totally disagree with you 

He just deleted the top part 

I think that is wrong 

Just as you have all the right in the world to state your view so I have all the right in the world to say I totally disagree with you Even in a fun way  if I so feel like it and not insult you Lunatic fringe  in my view  is applied to everybody to everyone else who they do not agree with 

I hope you see it that way too

I also have the right to excercise my authors liberty and say it in a nonconventional way 

I do not think John Quiggin has the right to censor that 

Feel free to have me bannedblockedtaken outwhatever
