As the third wheel in this particular menageatrois noone else seems to care at this point I have to side with Msa1701 Whilst WPV may apply in situations such as Band X has sold 30m albums but that only includes their first 2 albums not their third which has been out for 2 months but there are no figures for that album this debate to me appears to fall more under the auspices of WPUCS All of the cited references stem from the same common source  the brochure specs If a helicopter engineer and a pilot both posit that those numbers are at best optimistic suggests to me that the figures arent robust enough to guarantee their inclusion in an encyclopedia I dont think that this constitutes WPOR just that it renders sufficient doubt on the given citations to preclude their inclusion as inarguable verifiable fact On that basis I propose reverting to Msa1701s last revision Ill give it 24 hours and Im also shifting this discussion to the articles talk page as that seems the more sensible place
