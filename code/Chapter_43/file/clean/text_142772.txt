As mod is a short term for modification it is a mod Any change made to the original software or content must be considered a modification whether it is 1 bit or 100 MB Because it has been changed beyond the original design and construction of the game USing a Game Shark or Action Replay is actually modifying code to make this available thus the game you are then playing is _not_ the original game no matter how you look at it
