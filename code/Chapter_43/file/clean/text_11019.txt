Actually the citations dont agree on the nature of the similarity Its not a good practice to single out critics in the lead section either This proposal has not received any support in the discussion at Deathtrap so I think until there is a consensus to include it in the lead it is correct to leave it out I dont see where you are opening a dialogue actually You are simply ignoring everyones objections I believe I offered the idea of including the material elsewhere in the article instead of cutting it altogether so perhaps you could take my suggestion
