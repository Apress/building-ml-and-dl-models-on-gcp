EuroVelo map image

Gday Quadell Im not sure about which category the usage comes under I looked at the map and saw the names of the authors but couldnt see a copyright sign I do know however that the EuroVelo people were so happy when I sent them an email to tell them I had made a Wikipedia page that they put my name up on their website Now when I do a Google search for me name I get that site at the top of the list
