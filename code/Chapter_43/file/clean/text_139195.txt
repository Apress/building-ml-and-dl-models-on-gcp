Honestly I was always under the impression that Mongol and Mongolic were interchangeable terms in light of the fact that the modernday Mongols are an extremely homogeneous group a la the Arabs and Turkic peoples The differences between German and Germanic for example are far greater than the differences between Turk and Turkic Likewise when it comes to the Mongols the terms Mongol and Mongolic arent really meant to have different meanings since the Mongols are extremely homogeneous
