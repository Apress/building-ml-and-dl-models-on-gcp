The following quotes are taken verbatim from the Appaloosa talk page They are made by editors who self identified themselves as female To my knowledge they have never been admonished or cautioned for these very questionable remarks I on the other hand find myself permanently blocked by dreadstar The nature of dread stars gender is immaterial to the obvious fact that I am being subjected to a double standard of scrutiny and punishment because I dont have a second X chromosome  Or do you claim that this is also a fringe theory
I hope this matter can be settled here without recourse to an appeal to higher scrutiny And I want either my edit restored as a just and rightful response to this rather catty calumny Or I want these feminine offenses to common manners to be equally expunged

The Daily Mail presents Engstroms theory that Americanborn Scott always believed they came from Asia across the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia As Ealdgyth points out with links to scientific literature that assertion is simply patent nonsense and WPFRINGE

The Daily Mail such an expert source also presents Engstroms theory that there are fewer than 200 true Appaloosas left in the world That is also patent nonsense The Appaloosa museum explains that there were about 200 officially registered Appaloosas in 1947 By 1978 there were 300000 living and deceased of course Today there are 635000 This breed isnt even close to rare 
But Scott has often questioned this history because she thinks the numbers of spotted horses that were in the Pacific northwest part of America when explorers Lewis and Clark first made their way over the Rockies in the early 1800s didnt quite tally with her experience of being a breeder She said there were too many of them for that to be the case so shed always had this theory that maybe horses had come across the Pacific into America by a different route  THAT is a fringe theory
