Of course Thurmond should stay  I had assumed he wasnt in the BAN list because his party claimed to be the Democratic Party and in many states was but it does appear he was not on the ballot in enough states to have been able to win  He and his party are obviously a special case with strong appeal and organization only in a narrow region  I think including all those who were on enough ballots or received at least 01 of the total popular vote or carried at least one state would work well  TalkCont
