Appropriate tags for articles vs talk pages 

Gday Mav  Thanks for the note on my talk page regarding the expansion template  However Im a little confused the WikipediaAvoid selfreferences page that you refer to explicitly mention stub npov and expansion as appropriate to appear in the article text of a developing or disputed article

If Wikipedia policy is that stub is fine on article text but expansion is not then WikipediaAvoid selfreferences should be updated appropriately

However Ill be sure to put more bulky tags like expansion on the talk pages in future

All the very best and thanks for all your hard work and contributions to wikipedia   talk 1015 10 Feb 2005 UTC
