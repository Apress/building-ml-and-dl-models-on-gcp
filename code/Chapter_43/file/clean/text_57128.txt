Unless there have been drastic changes since I was there I think it would be hard to make the argument that AS is one of the strictest private schools in the United States  

It is a private boarding school and it is expected to be far more rigerous then other types of schools both for academics and discipline  But as these types of schools go its actually quite lax

So they dont let you use IMthats not really egregious or anything  I mean if they were locking students in their rooms maybye that would be a criticism  But as I recall we had quite a bit of freedom and perks for upperclassmen

Maybye Im getting old but I just think putting these kinds of gripes on wikipedia is kinda infantile 

As for tuition it is my understanding that it actually costs about twice what is charged in tuition for each studentbut it is covered via a trust fund and other forms of fund raising  It is a good education and a good experience IMOmy first two years of college were cake after AS
