Re  SixDay War
Please do not keep undoing other peoples edits without discussing them first This is considered impolite and unproductive If you continue you may be blocked from editing Wikipedia under the threerevert rule which states that nobody may revert an article to a previous version more than three times in 24 hours Note this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit If the effect of your actions is to revert back it qualifies as a revert Thank you
