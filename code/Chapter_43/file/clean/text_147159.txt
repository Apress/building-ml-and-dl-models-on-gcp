It has been 25 years since I read Jungs book on synchronicity but there is a summary at the back of the book describing the acausal conncecting principal  While I can see that there are similarities in the 2 philosophies of Astrology  Synchronicity I do not see that the primary source Jung was referring to astrology at the time that he described the principal

However I am willing to reread any few pages of Jungs works you cite
