You forgot to add the url for your additional source I found this one  which if its the one you meant you might want to add From what I see in my find and in your quote above it gives the height as 800ft244m and NOT the 244m 801ft that you changed the text too I understand that 244m converts mathematically to to 800ft but it is also true that 800ft converts mathematically to 244m So as the latter seems a better match and as we have no good reason to assume otherwise Ive restored the original figures so as not to deviate from the official dimensions
