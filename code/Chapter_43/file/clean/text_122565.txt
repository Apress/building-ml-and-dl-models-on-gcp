The page has a long history of editors combatting RFC decisions Please review the sources used and previous postings before just reverting to a redirect Especially if it has been several years and from httpsenwikipediaorgwikiFrank_VanderslootOil_of_Melaleuca2C_Inc down we basically have a coatracked article on Melaleuca inside the Frank L Vandersloot page I dont see the reason to treat this content with spite A new AFD would appease me I guess  however I guess youve decided to escalate to the point of an admin review
