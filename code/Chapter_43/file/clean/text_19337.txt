Hi Proudbolsahye Sorry for the delay in reply No problem about Patton it happens  In regards to Maghakians infobox the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person containing only key information succinctly The ribbon icons in my opinion detract from the information serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be I know you pointed out the case of the John Shalikashvili article but I think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out which should not have to be the case it should be presented just there The article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed as you have done in Maghakian but not too much information placed in the infobox As for the service medals as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received and not service medals Maghakian is notable for his awards of the Navy Cross Silver Star Bronze Star and Purple Heart the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox If he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here I think you would be better off expanding the awards section of the article and keeping the infobox succinct Cheers
