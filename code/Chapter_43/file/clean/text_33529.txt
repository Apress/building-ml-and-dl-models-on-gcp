Another issue I have is that most of the MBTA Green Line stations are suffixed with MBTA Station  So the naming of this article is already creating a conflict with the majority of articles on stations on this line  Also the infobox states that the previousfollowing station is Lechmere Thats correct in name only  the current Lechmere station will be demolished as part of the project and a new Lechmere station will be built on a different plot of land So the reference to Lechmere in the article should be to the new station not the current one This article is a mess
