I know you listed your English as on the level 2 but dont worry you seem to be doing nicely otherwise judging by the same page  so dont be taken aback I just wanted to know if you were aware of what you wrote and think its an interesting case
 I would write that sentence simply as Theoretically I am an altruist but only by word not by my actions
 PS You can reply to me on this same page as I have it on my watchlist
