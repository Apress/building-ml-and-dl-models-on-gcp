Feb 5 outbreak 

I have put mention on the In the News section but with old death toll numbers as no source has the 11 death toll which is based on combining all sources Once a final death toll comes I agree it should go to the main page Importance should increase to Mid at 20 deaths and High at 40 deaths   

i dont know why but i felt like i had to say your doing a great job on wikipeda  Preceding unsigned comment added by 81107131164   

Yeah I was going by past convention and the thought that it is all part of the article name Ill leave it for now but move it back once all calms down to avoid this becoming a war   

Look through all the WFO sites information statements local storm reports and SPC updates for ratings Do not add medialisted ratings unless confirmed by WFOs Certainly no onestop shop there   

Id wait for the NCDC report to come out since that provides final updated information and reliable sources
