May get blocked why
Im at this point more than confused and disturbed that I am repeatedly threatened with being blocked for the crime of reporting the incessant racist rants and antiSemitic personal attacks of another editor I am equally confused and disturbed at accusations of soapboxing forum shopping and the are leveled at me especially since my valid and subsequently confirmed complaint about antiSemitic ranting was met with a response of Shut the hell up by a sorta maybe admin who shut the case and I am as well confused and disturbed by the insinuations that I am somehow stampeding on this rabid antiSemites free speech by filing this complaint The first bold faced instruction on WPTALK is that talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views Does this somehow not apply if those personal views are antiSemitic Jew bashing racist personal attacks Is that an exception to WPTALK I am simply not getting it here and I am tired of the threats I am receiving as well as the open season style nasty attacks by other editors and admins who dont even bother to read the case Ive compiled Please explain
