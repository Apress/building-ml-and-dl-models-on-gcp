Jason Pierce and Jeremy May Deletion 

Hi You denied my request to delete these two pages because a lot of edits have been made to them both First Ill tell you the Jason Pierce page does get a lot of edits but they are always considered vandalism Most people will put small things in calling Jason names or creating unknown andor unneeded info Jason shows no notability other than being on The Ultimate Fighter where he was pulled from competing because of an illness TreyGeek and myself both agree that the page be deleted

Jeremy Mays article should be deleted because he also shows no notability other than being on The Ultimate Fighter The other thing about May is he doesnt even compete in mixed martial arts any more He has not fought for any big promotions and holds no titles There is no reason for him to have an article Thank you for reading
