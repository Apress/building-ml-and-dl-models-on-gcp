100 years of women in transport 

Hi

The campaign is a celebration of the role that women have played in the transport industry as a whole However the number of women that entered the transport industry  100000 is the number of the UK 
Could we agree on this so I can edit it back and place United Kingdom in the right place
At the moment after you edited it it says 

The 100 Years of women in transport campaign or YOWIT is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years in the United Kingdom following the centennial anniversary of the First World War when 100000 women entered the Transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service

My suggestion is

The 100 Years of women in transport campaign or YOWIT is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years following the centennial anniversary of the First World War when 100000 women entered the United Kingdoms transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service
