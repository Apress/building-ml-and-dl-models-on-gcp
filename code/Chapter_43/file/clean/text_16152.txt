The Milagro Beanfield War 

Hello I removed your addition to this article and wanted to say a few words about why  What you added was interesting but there is no reference and no indication that the real town of Milagro has any connection to either John Nichols novel or the film adaptation  Do you have a source that indicates that this town was his inspiration  That would be helpful  Cheers The 45
