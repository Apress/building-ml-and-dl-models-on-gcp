Well this could happen if only nitpicking  such as what you are doing here  can cease and good writing and editing can continue If you are to seek honesty Bunchofgrapes then please do so by monitoring your own actions You make a lot of accusations that are not true and then consider reverts as hostile I started this particular article and welcome additions from others in the Wikipedia community However your additions are POV and NOT again  not sourced I again ask you to also cite sources Bunchofgrapes if you are to edit with your point of view  which by the way is not neutral nor written in a manner based on knowledge of Judicial Astrology that from my view is not helpful to the WikiPage in question You do an awful lot of of complaining Bunchofgrapes and instant reverting while accusing others of things that are common to Wikipedia  writing and editing and  sourcing I suggest you then also please add your knowledge of astrology and judicial astrology before your own particular reverts Please source Consensus does not mean to agree of POV but to source materials that relate to the subject at hand If you have knowledge of this subject opn astrology and its related subjects then please by all means add your knowledge and not your personal pointofview Please cite sources Thanks
