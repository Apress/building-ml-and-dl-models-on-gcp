GT Pro Series 

GT Cube is a separate game in many regards and it should have its own article despite the merge that was decided on here It was released in June 2003 in Japan while GT Pro Series was released in January of 2007 in Japan  thats a four year release difference and contrary to the talk in the other article not similar at all to a multiplatform game being released on multiple systems The Wii version came packaged with its own wiiremote and has a graphical update It should be noted that in his review for GT Pro Series Mark Bozon commented on the similarity between the games but he meant it as more of an insult  not a comment on the fact that theyre exactly the same game When two games have such similar control schemes how can any of us seriously say that these are the same game  Nomader Talk 

Because the Wii version looks worse than any other Wii game I have played and worse than most GameCube games I have played The game is garbage in every sense of the word regardless of what system its on The game is a disgrace to the Wii and GameCube 7585112149 talk
