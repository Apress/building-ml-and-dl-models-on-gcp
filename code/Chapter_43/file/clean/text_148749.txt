About which one falls through note what Angier says at the end  He says each time he stepped into the machine he didnt know if he was going to be the man in the balcony the prestige or in the water tank the box  Wouldnt this imply that which one falls into the tank isnt the same each time that sometimes its the clone and sometimes its the original Angier even though after a few trial runs there wouldnt be an original Angier just clones  Juts a thought   1547 29
