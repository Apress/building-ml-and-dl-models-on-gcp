Thank you for your message I was trying to complement this article with an external link towards an additional reference which is informative for Wikipedia users for instance with considering the liner notes attached to the recording this has nothing to do with search engine rankings Also I emulated the syntax used by external links still available on Wikipedia towards websites like Naxos and Decca Classics I have looked for guidelines on how recordings could be listed at the bottom of articles alongside bibliographical references but without success so far Would you be able to help on that matter Would it be ok to add a Selected recordings heading to list the details of the recordind there
Selected recordings
 Daniel Meylan organ Psaumes de la Réforme Éditions Hortus HORT064
In the meantime I shall discuss it on the articles talk page before reinserting it as you suggested Beyond this specific case I have not been able to find any information in the Composers Project on how to reference recordings in composers articles are only bibliographical references meant to be listed in a composers article If so is it fully logical Thanks again for your help
