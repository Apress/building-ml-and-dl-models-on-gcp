And PBS as you are a bit of an expert on Wikipolicies I know I have read somewhere that neutral words like killing are to be used rather than POV terms like massacre slaughtered etc Perhaps you could direct Mr Downey to the appropriate link One can just imagine Mr Downeys reaction if I starting inserting murdered to describe the execution of the 1916 leaders  or referred to the men in the GPO as being slaughtered  He has rather a long history of inserting POV language into this particular article and his intransigent attitude made me think perhaps the same unintentional bias and poor choice of words infects the rest of his Irish History writing on Wiki I am going to examine that shortly
