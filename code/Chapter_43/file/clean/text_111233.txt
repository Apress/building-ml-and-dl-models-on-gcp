Thanks for your comments  You asked Why single out RCOG  That would be because the present article is about RCOG

You asked would you described these as prochoice advocacy groups  Please observe that my edit to this article said that RCOG took a prochoice position about a particular issue  That is different from saying that RCOG is a prochoice advocacy group  KillerChihuahua pointed out that difference here

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA though its not relevant in connection with the present article  Yes I would personally view the BMA as a prochoice advocacy group  After all the report to which you refer states that the BMA does not start off from a neutral position in this debatethe BMA has repeatedly since the 1970s agreed sic policy statements supporting the Abortion Act  and calling for the legislation to be extended to Northern Ireland

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities  As you know such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions but youre correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits

However RCOG has said it is prochoice explicitly supporting rights of women to exercise personal choice  RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits but has also sought to make abortions easier and faster  It therefore would seem very odd to contend that RCOG has never taken any prochoice positions
