If the citations say that the four major denominations are orthodox reform etc etc then it is OK with me to say the four major denominations and in a footnote say what those dnoms are   this is the intro so we want to make it fairly breif   you are correct there is a problem with the nearly all   there is also a problem with all  the 200000 messianic jews might consider themselves a major denomination
