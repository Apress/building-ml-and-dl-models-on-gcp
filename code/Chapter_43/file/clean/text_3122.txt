Football player statistics 

Hi NathanCo and thanks for your message Of course the information youve been adding to footballers pages is accurate but here at Wikipedia there is a convention to summarise league competition only in the infobox where you see it at the top while cups and European competitions are generally displayed much further down the page No one is suggesting you are adding bad data but please bear the above in mind when making future edits Thanks a lot for your contributions so far and we look forward to seeing many more of them 679
