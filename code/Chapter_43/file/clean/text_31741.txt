Needs citations 

Gentlemen this article is going to get an ugly citation template if you continue without proper citations This is a serious topic not pop culture fancruft so we expect better from you Its been a year since it was shown that this was a problem yet there are still only two inline citations Please try to rectify this as soon as possible Note the citations need not be Internet accessible  good old fashion book citations are more than sufficient
