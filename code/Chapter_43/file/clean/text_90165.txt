Daniels did not know all of the details of the TCW he didnt even know the identity of the Suliban Cabals leader  I think the relevent issue is how the TCW is defined  Has Daniels given a definition in any episode  Do the Sphere Builders fit within the scope of this  Since Future Guy and Daniels both knew about the Xindi there may be a TCW connection
