No I didnt mean point me at a biographical article though that would be good too  I mean answer right here on the discussion page  What town were you born in  Which schools did you go to  Also regarding over the top I disagree  I think the article could do with quite a bit more expansion as could the articles of the other individuals you mentioned  As for greatest living magicians I have to admit Id never heard those names  How are you judging that say Max Maven is better than a David Copperfield  Is it by awards industry press or just personal opinion of their technique
