Just a reminder and a tip 

Hi regarding your edit to current events First its best practice to add new content to a talk page at the bottom otherwise it will most probably be ignored Ive moved it for you Secondly the Current events portal and associated pages are where we list news on a daily basis with a link to background articles This is an encyclopedia not a newspaper If you want to report news try Wikinews
