If you mean Can u do _IP_ multicast with TCP no plain TCP requires the sender  receiver to establish a 3 way handshake and this is only between two parties  TCP also uses other mechanisms for flow control etc which are geared towards a two party only config Having said that TCP maybe used to setup multicast topologies in higher layers see above discussions on IRC etc There might also be other reliable  possiblly connection oriented layer 4 protocols that support IP multicast  20317311157
