My view is that policy exists to instruct people who dont know how to write an encyclopedia Someone who wished to learn how to write an encyclopedia would read WPCATR learn from it and apply that knowledge to the infobox Your point seems to be based on the view that the commonsense idea that people identify their own religion using their own wording applies to categories but not to infoboxes Its a point full of wikilawyering minutiae thats worthy of derision and thats why Im making fun of you and people like you for having it My intent is not to stamp out opposition Its to laugh at it and to actually hope it continues so I can enjoy laughing at it again
