Nope This  content edit to the article was not merely aggressive biased editing it was in fact nothing short of POVdriven vandalism Sarah777 when making that edit clearly knew she was falsifying the contents of the page She knew that the term BI in fact does include Ireland in the usage of the Englishspeaking world at large and that this meaning is the topic of that article Of course she doesnt want the world to be that way but she know that it actually is that way Changing an article in order to make it conform to the way you want the world to be rather than to the way you know the world actually is is vandalism period
 This together with  on the associated talk page which clearly is biased aggressive rhetoric
