User talkChedorlaomer 

Could you take another look at this block  You blocked his main account for being used mainly at least lately for undoing other users edits  On close inspection though he was undoing edits of blocked Hkelkar socks in other words reverting edits made by a banned user  If this is the whole story I would be inclined to simply unblock is there more to it  juicetalk
