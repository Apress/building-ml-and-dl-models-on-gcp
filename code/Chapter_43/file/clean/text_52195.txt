Wowyou hold a masters degree in economics and have taken many doctoral courses Is that supposed to impress us Most professional economists are on the payroll of the FED so of course they reject Austrian economics AE is however the oldest continual school of economic thought Moreover it doesnt have the dismal track record of mainstream economics which to quote Bill Maher is a litany of getting shit dead wrong From the Wall Street crash 1929 to the nonexistent depression of 1946 to the Bretton Woods system the stagflation of the 1970s the SL crisis of the 1980s the dotcom bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s From Keynes suggestion to bury FEDnotes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up to Samuelsons insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989 to Krugmans Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head With a track record like that of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right that understand what economics actually is and more importantly what it isnt
Its not the mainstream economists that dont take AE seriously its the other way around For good reason So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics Like Jefferson said youd be better informed of current events if you didnt read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day Likewise youre likely to have a far better understanding of economics if youve never taken an economics course than having spent years studying Keynesianism monetarism neoclassicism or whatever mishmash of mainstream schools that gets taught in the universities today
