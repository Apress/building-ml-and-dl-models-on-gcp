Hi I didnt add mile rather all the others besides US UK Canada did you READ the four separate references as to where the mile is used in Canada  Not everyone drives a train but obviously trains are a very important part of the efficient affordable bulk transportation of goods  Whether or not they are in common use they are there every day on Canadian railways and every race at the track  This isnt a popularity contest its merely a statement of things as they exist in certain aspects of transportation in Canada  If one wants to conduct a locomotive on a Canadian railroad they had better learn about the mile and the foot or they will have a hard time getting a job

Also would like to point out that the nautical mile and thousands of feet of altitude are also used exclusively in Canadian airspace this practice is so prevalent it has spread to one of the most metric countries in the world  Russia

So there are definitely sectors where these units dominate pop culture aside and they need to be reported as such  Canada probably shouldnt be the first listing as the mile is only used in specialized sectors  Perhaps hearer to the end along with Puerto Rico and Turks  Caicos  I just left Canada after US UK and put the rest in ABC order because it took a long time to find all those references  Feel free to reorder and otherwise clean it up however you see fit  I also have US Territories and British interspersed with actual independent nations they should probably be separated
