Still concerned about balance 

Ive put in a fair bit of time on the article both in verifyingcleaning content and filling in material enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail

Look for example at Korea and the CaribbeanCubaCuban missile crisis those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage Just to say with no other background that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesnt give information Id recommend waiting for more background and context

There are news reports from reputable journalists but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions Im afraid I dont give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker

The article is impossibly long yet its covert operations section is full of fragments Its going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited its taking a long time to save the file now  Note that I was able to put estimativeanalytic material in for Korea and Cuba Much data of that sort is available often in the form of the actual declassified documents Not to put in relevant reports National Intelligence Estimates etc gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial dirty tricks Thats not NPOV

Many sources are available for the report literature including the George Washington University National Security Archives the Avalon Project at Yale the archives at Mount Holyoke the military staff colleges and research institutes the Foreign Relations of the United States series and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room There is for example a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia including strong disagreements among the CIA military Office of the Secretary of Defense and White House Sam Adams book War of Numbers is excellent but also see the Pentagon Papers

Id like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence which may help understand things that arent just covert destabilization Start with Intelligence cycle management which will take you through a hierarchy of articles The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity Im actively working on them The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history and balance between clandestine and covert activities Especially in WWII there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering 

Please let me help but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced Believe me I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic not fragmentary and accusatory way
