Its not social networking  as its a music page its music promotion Also the copyright on Francks music expired in 1965 so the Copyvio claim is without foundation Its not a blog either The blog function is used solely to educate its readership about the music The own website thing hardly applies either  I merely run the page It is in effect Francks website I get no glorification from that page
