Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be but still I say her range is Bb2G7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3G7 C3 is the lowest note in My All Emotions Youre So Cold and I believe other songs A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone I dont know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot Notes should be checked before saying what they are People start rumors about alot of things like the note in Youre So Cold being G2 Its not My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard its pretty accurate too Its better than a tuner Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them  0627
