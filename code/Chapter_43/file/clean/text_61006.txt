btw there needs to be some serious fact checking on some claims such as does blanks pond actually even exist anymore or did people realize it was a mud puddle full of shit and fill it up a long time ago Is TAS really nonprofit NO The college acceptance rate for the graduating class has always been above ninety percentwhat does this mean people from TAS get accepted 90 of the time NO

Seriously the censorship needs to go away weve seen that TAS has sports facilities and a hot meal line we also want to see what the taiwanese people feel about TAS because that is an important part of what TAS is we need to publish the incidents that are so important to TAS juz cuz you think it givves TAS a bad name doesnt mean that it shouldnt be published if its true then fuck let there be light this censorship shit is really really gay  0653 20 Apr 2005 UTC
