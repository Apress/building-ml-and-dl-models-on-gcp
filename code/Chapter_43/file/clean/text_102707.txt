AfroEurasia 

There is or was a dubious  discuss tag for the four continents theory Apparently nobody discussed this so far I did not know this theory IOW I considered the four continents as patent nonsense But checking the article it turned out to make sense one land mass as explained in the article with a nice animated GIF showing the count 

Unrelated the article states quite often that SpainPortugalGreece consider the Americas as one continent JFTR that is also the case in Germany or rather it was the case 40 years ago I cant tell what they teach today More precisely in Germany the Americas are considered as one continent with three subcontinents North Middle  Central South with Mexico and the Caribbean as part of Central America Many contributors on this talk page already pointed out that there is no such thing as an Australian continent that continent is known as Oceania please fix this My own SoFixIt for today was a reference for the eighth continent  another case of patent nonsense that turned out to be okay if so far only one source is good enough 8920413653
