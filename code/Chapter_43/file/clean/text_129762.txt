 Per WikipediaLEADLength the introduction seems a bit too short  It should probably be expanded from one to two paragraphs  
 Several references have unnecessary spaces between the punctuation and the opening square bracket
 Multiple adjacent references should be put in order of ascending reference number
 Why are teletype  tags wrapped around some refs but not others  I dont recall ever seeing this done  These should probably be removed to give the inline superscripted citations a more uniform look and feel
