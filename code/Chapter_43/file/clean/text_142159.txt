Since Felisopus is complaining about this sarcastic recapitulation of mine here the correct translation Hey Im contacting you because I suppose you know the topic have more sources available Note of the translator more sources is supposed to mean more than zero and hopefully write a better English than I do I just edited a couple of articles on enwikipedia like Ladin language and immediately 34 different edit wars started due to total reverts right now even the centurylong Germanization of the territory is being censured Note of the translator wrong the Germanization is already mentioned in the correct article I think that shows clearly the level of the discussion Thank you for your attention and good work
