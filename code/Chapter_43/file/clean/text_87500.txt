Qutbi Bohra article

i would like to bring to your kind attention  that the Qutbi article has been vandalised beyond recognition the process of wait and watch you had suggested has resulted in that group of editors who were literally vandalising the article by illegitimate blanking and by gaming the system have now made it into an advertisement of Khuzaima Qutbuddin they have even added a personal legal notice not at all connected with Qutbi Bohra you still consider their edit to be a good faith edit and instead of stopping them will you still stand by their side the last time they had done a lot of harm and regarding that info by sam you had quoted in your suggestion earlier it is just part of that article the full article will give a clear picture  i am really sorry for using the name of editor but if you check the talk pages of these editors you will see that all of them have been called by Ftutocdg and they are doing what Ftutocdg is asking them to they are not concerned with the article or its content but only with their pov for Khuzaima Qutbuddin they have incited you against the content but their intention is to either delete the article or make it meaningless and use it for their own purposes i request you to please do the needful and save the article at least try to see through their plan

and regarding my article at  AFC it is not for publishing dont worry and this time i did not find the plus sign on the mobile i see the pen shaped logo when i click it it opens a edit box which does not have any plus sign when i type and save it saves on top
