I totally agree with you that it is nonsense to classify heterogenous nomadic confederations in Asia as one particular ethnic group The Huns the Hephthalites the Rouran and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins  from IndoIranian Scythians to Siberian protoAltaics Yet we have to have SOME standard in here And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources 
 The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites or GökTurks were homogenous As for the Hephthalites the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles such as Khaqan is attested in the scripts of Bactria Yet the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin Thats why Chinese sources such as the PeyShi considered them members of the YüeChi who were IndoEuropean Tocharians We cant just assume certain origins because of some royal titles Not everyone who used the title Khaqan was automatically a Turk or Mongol The best example for this is the IndoEuropean title Yabghu probably from Tocharian or Iranian whi was almost exclusively used by NonIndoEuropean Turks Now we can assume that  at some point in history  the early Turks were ruled by an IndoEuropeanspeaking elite probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian but this is not enough to call the early Turks a mix of IndoEuropean and Altaic peoples see Turkic peoples 
 I hope you understand
