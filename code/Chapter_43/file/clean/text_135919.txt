Help 

Yamla there is still currently an edit war going on at the Billa 2007 film 

Still UserAnwar saadat UserPrince Godfather and UserPokkiri have been constantly adding unconfirmed info into the article and whenever I try to changing or neutralising them they keep reverting back The problem is the plot section they keep adding is directly taken from Don 2007 film of which Billa is a remake of Don was shot in Malaysia you see and I dont think Billa will be And the trivia section Ive trying to rid the article of is FILLED WITH FANGUSH 

Help me Btw heres are those edits
