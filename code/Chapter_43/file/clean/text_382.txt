Just dropping by I thought Id leave a little feedback too A featured picture is not always put on the main page as noted by WPPOTD For example the seminude Michele Merkin was not used as it was found too cheesy WikipediaPicture of the dayUnused notes several pictures that were not used because they depict too much gore or are of a scatological nature A featured picture rating is essentially indicating that the community feels that the image is of high quality and high encyclopedic value On a side note POTD seems to be up to  
Thanks for taking up the trace Pink Oboe
