As the nominator I want to thank you for taking the time to do an indepth review of the article  I was guilty of sinking in unsigned responses to some of your comments in order to communicate progress  The article was renominated in September after three intensive days of full time effort to address all of the concerns from the prior GA review which was summarily rejected without any interaction  I thought that a featured article should certainly meet GA criteria and we designated the article as the August 2010 Wikiproject Universities collaboration of the month  The result was an improved article including many new footnotes mostly to source the fact that the notable alumni actually attended Cornell To give the collaboration a valid end point I nominated the article for GA and renominated it after addressing the listed concerns not aware of the defects that you uncovered  Because the GA queue is months long there was a peer review between the second GA nomination and your review although that review ended up mostly focusing on images  There was no intent to shop for some yes man Again thank you for your time
