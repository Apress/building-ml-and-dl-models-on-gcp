There is no evidence that this edition is any more important than any other  The primary source manuscript is in the Paris Opera Library and any qualified scholar could have access to it to prepare an edition  Several editions exist and are used for both performance and study 
The score of this edition is for sale for 520 Euros  The score of Verdis Trovatore is available from Dover for 36 euros  I hardly think that this edition would qualify as a notforprofit enterprise  However you might have more information than I have on this  
If you really feel that this information is important then why dont you add it to the article without the commercial link  That way the information is available without the possibility of conflict of interest and spam
