Out of the two lists my edits could only possibly fall into three categories however I would disagree with two of them
NPOV violation  I am removing POV from the article by ensuring CP is correctly quoted and that an alternative viewpoint is offered to the liberally biased criticism of the project
Stubbornness  if standing up for the truth and acting as a barrier to the liberal smears rampant on the project makes me stubborn then so be it but history will judge me as being forced to engage in edit wars against other stubborn editors who refused to consider anything other than their liberal delusions
It is clear that my edits were not vandalism and in labeling them as such you made a clear personal attack against me for which I demand an apology
