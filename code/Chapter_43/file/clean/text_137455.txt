Noting that it was hardly vandalism Any psuedointellectual can pretend hes some sort of PhD online and somehow use that to justify walls of ridiculous text Not that you arent a PhD of course but you can see how easy it would be to make something like that up Also this isnt a Troll its just a look at a different point of view of how easy wikipedias weaknesses are to exploit when anybodys claims to expertise cant be checked Seriously not a troll Your opinion that this is a troll is welcome but please have it objectively looked at before you start deleting things you dont like ThanksPreceding unsigned comment added by 751788544
