So  Im sure youre a really nice guy but it looks like youre adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label singles discography which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label singles discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article because the article would grow as those and more artist release more singles and songs which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanupreorganize tags Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label singles discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted organized and written like any other record label singles discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified

There is no Wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label singles discography except for you  Im sure youre a really nice guy but this just plain bias which Wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators
