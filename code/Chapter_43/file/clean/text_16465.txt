TalkFemale genital mutilation please stop
Hi Elvey I noticed you on Johnuniqs page which I watch and was moved to check out the discussion at TalkFemale genital mutilation Your part of it worried me While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics as FGM is not a field Ive studied I see two principles in play on that talkpage that are true for all articles and that you seem to pay scant attention to 

1 Use reliable secondary sources Its important for all articles but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM to be based on reliable secondary sources Synthesising sources in order to argue in Wikipedias voice with a UNICEF report from 2013 isnt on unless you have a reliable source as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources that offers the same argument 
2 Consensus Nobody except partly Vetrisimino0 agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article There is consensus against your section tags described here as overly aggressive I hope the issue of the tags has blown over but a few days ago you kept restoring them and defend them aggressively the fact that the article is being prepped for WPFAC seems to anger you further and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WPOWN a serious accusation which shouldnt be made without good evidence and which you have taken to SVs user talkpage as well

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you as far as I can see youre the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this where you call Zads comment blatantly untrue not to mention insulting  based as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done he wasnt That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people eggshells armed with hammers Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships Please dont jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you Worse your header here is a noxious badfaithassuming personal attack something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin which you had moved there from your own talkpage That is truly awful behaviour seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off Charming edit summary at your own page btw If you cant stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever youre contradicted this post aggressively attacking Johnuniq is a charming recent example I advise you to take a break from the article Thats advice What I tell you as an uninvolved admin is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before and you must stop attacking people Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute currently at the bottom of the page is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin or warned you in any way If Ive missed where SV is playing the admin card tell me where The word disrupt which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation is by no means _ the prerogative of admins   talk 

I appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at FGM by taking the discussion here  I wish youd participate in the discussion of the facts instead  I feel that in coming here you raisereiterate some good points but I dont think you should be raising the first few at least here
1 Use reliable secondary sources emphasis is in the original  I totally agree and I said that in the discussion The sources are given and reliable and secondary and Also apropos Anything about prevalence needs a strong secondary source are you saying that the source were using for reporting the UNICEF stats in the first place is better It s
