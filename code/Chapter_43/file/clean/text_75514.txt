This is for the user small bones There is no documentation for any other spokesman for irom Sharmila apart from me Thats just original research from your wiki colleagues 
This is an analysis by Medha Patkar which points out that unconditional release will result only in Sharmilas death She points out that the call for unconditional release is just another form of brutal treatment but you can read the article yourself httpzeenewsindiacomnewsnationgovernmentbrutallydealingwithiromsharmilamedhapatkar_1462222html
This is the Indian Express report which points out that she has no real supporters in Manipur Mr Babloo Loitongbam controls many fake NGOs in Manipur and is doing what he can to isolate her httpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindiaothersiromsharmilareleasedagainrefusestogowithhersupportersandbreaksdown99
This is a reference to the Indian Intelligence Bureau and RAW about Manipuri NGOs working as foreign industrial spies httpwwwnewindianexpresscomthesundaystandardNGOsForeignFundsFuelTerror20140622article2292852ece
The original leaked report doesnt have the names of the NGOs or the names of the foreign spies but Mr Babloo Loitongbam outed himself and other Manipuris in this press release httpepaonetGPaspsrc2260614jun14
This is a report in Sharmilas own words voice and video of the abuses she has been facing including httpwwwndtvcomvideoplayerleftrightcentreiromsharmilaonifhericonicfasthasbeenhijacked297129

Those are a few to be going on with There are three trials in total You dont require original research to work that out She is being held in Imphal on judicial warrants if there werent any trials in Imphal then she wouldnt be in prison The last dates of the trial in Delhi are correct 11  12 August 2015 but it is nonsense to claim that there are no trials in Imphal or that it is impossible to find any reference to them If in doubt use Google 

The SS group has no standing with Sharmila but is also run by Mr Babloo Loitongbam He comes from a very powerful police family and people suck up to him If he drops the plans to have sharmila killed then you can campaign for him to get the nobel peace prize I have no vendetta against anyone I am just trying to point out the truth and keep my fiancee alive But this is just wiki and only the lazy believe everything they read here
