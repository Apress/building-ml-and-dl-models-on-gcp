Hi in the Austin Texas article you made an edit to which you stated Austin was in the Southern US it is not If you have been there it is quite clear it is not southern The large Hispanic community with great TexMex flavor is not southern and is not found in Mississippi Alabama Georgia etc Please do not state Austin is southern as some might take offense to that I know I do

My reply on Guanako512s talk page
Hi you left a note on my Talk page accusing me of making an erroneous edit to the Austin Texas page Youve got the wrong person Ive made one and only one edit to that page My edit simply reverted vandalism removing sentences stating Texas as a whole is a terrible state to live in dont move here and Jordan was here  

Hi My apologies I appreciate your edit I guess I should have looked more carefully Again my apoligies  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
