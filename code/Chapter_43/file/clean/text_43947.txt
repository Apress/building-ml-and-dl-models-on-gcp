Cesc Fabregas 

The English transfer window opened on June 10th not July 1st as you so wrongly stated Therefore the transfer is officially valid Fabregas himself confirmed the transfer by stating Wenger turned me down so Ive joined Chelsea to win some trophies all parties have confirmed the deal I really dont understand why youre being so stubborn about this Everybody has confirmed hes joining Chelsea and the English transfer window has already opened
