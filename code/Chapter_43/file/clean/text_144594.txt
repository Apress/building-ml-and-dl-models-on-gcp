Take a break from dates 

Im sorry to see that Greg is getting on your last nerve  You know that there are people that understand and agree with your point  so stop pushing it  I know Im not always able to follow that advice myself so Im not trying to be holierthanthou or condescending apologies if it comes across that way  My inadvertently driving Gerry away was a real eyeopener for me  I disagreed with him quite regularly but I never felt he was actively disruptive  The same goes for PmAndersonSeptrasomething who hasnt really contributed to the debate for a while  The useless pointcounterpoint were participating in with Greg and Tony is driving away all the people who might otherwise come to a reasonable conclusion or at least legitimize the debate if we werent monopolizing things  Youve already suggested a Wikibreak for the same group that I just did in fact its partly what gave me the idea and I think we should just abide by it whether or not the other side does  Ryan and the other ArbCom folk arent stupid theyll see whats happened and hopefully give due weight to the opinions of people who have tried to act responsibly  If not then is it really worth fighting for anyway  Cheers
