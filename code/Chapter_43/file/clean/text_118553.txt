Need serious revisionattention 

Im sorry but if the description of the disappearance says their car was found near a bridge or a dam thats not a mysterious disappearance  If the description says the police think the dingo got your baby or the police arrested and convicted someone for the abduction of this person also no longer a mystery  Why does this list have the name of every Australian ever known to not come home on it  Also not to be cold hearted but child abductions should not qualify for this list  If they do then where are the other hundreds of thousands of child abductions that have happened worldwide
