A hint 

Heres a hint If your textbooks in grade schools didnt claim Israel doesnt have a right to exist if parents in your society werent teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins if your government didnt name streets after mass murderers pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes and if YOUR PEOPLE werent spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure starting businesses and building better lives then there would be no need for checkpoints no need for a bigass wall no need for anything of the sort And youd have your state Youd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state

You could have been living freely if the Arab states had accepted the offer signed a nonagression pact and let you come home instead of stuffing your parents inside refugee camps cynically turning you into shock troops and poster children for oh look what the Jews did to our people when we stuffed them into refugee camps instead of taking the easy way to let them go home

You could have had a Palestinian state in 1948 You could have had one at any time after that

But its as you say On the last day even the rocks and the trees will shout O Muslim there is a Jew hiding behind me come and kill him

Your goal isnt a Palestinian state Its the death of my people and establishing a sharia state on top of their cooling bodies

I just cleaned up some of your ridiculous lies on one page Im not going to bother checking anywhere else  YET That would be wikistalking


You will stop being pompous
You will stop being a racist
You will stop trying to push your astonishingly biased POV into articles
You WILL STOP LYING

You will also stop trying to hide when someone calls you on your racist attitudes
