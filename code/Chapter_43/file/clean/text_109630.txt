Removed Copyrighted Material 

You brought to my attention that the History of Manga Before World War II section contained copyrighted material I have therefore deleted it This is Wikipedia policy  Content that violates any copyright will be deleted You gave me no choice about it I do not want to offend or anger you but the policy is very clear An article cannot use anything that is copyrighted unless the copyright is transferred

 

You are misunderstanding My texts content is not related Its not the copyright problem but the GFDL problem GFDL demands original authors names or original texts URL when reprinting the text however your reprint didnt satisfy it Its the GFDL violation without any relation to the content of my text By the way please add new message bottom of the talkpage
