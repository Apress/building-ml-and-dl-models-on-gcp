PS I see that 672353464  has exactly four edits on WP  The first was simply changing the name in the article with no citation of proof  The next two changes involved reverting to this removed change twice  Finally the entry above which should be at the bottom of the talk page not the top  This is one editor offering no proof reverting the same change repeatedly down in sunny Florida  The IP address can be traced and IPs can be blocked from WP if they have demonstrated a pattern of vandalistic behavior  Do not revert Linda Maria Ronstadt to Maria Linda Ronstadt again without a solid reference included in the article  Thanks again
