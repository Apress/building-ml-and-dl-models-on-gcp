Original research
Ref this removal this does not constitute original research I did not say that the first article was created then I have no access to any proof one existed before or not and am not assuming anything so far I stated that this article was created then with the appropriate proof We surely do not need third party sourcing for interpreting our own software If the apparent need for this piece of article text to exist is to refute claims made against Wikipedia then including the date of this article being created is going to be quite pertinent to the reader dont you think
