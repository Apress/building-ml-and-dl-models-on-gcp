Can Someone Lock in the New Links that CIA Keeps Deleting

I have added what I consider after 20 years of advocacy against fierce opposition from CIA and its FBIS minions
a few essential links  I dont have the time or energy to fight the morons  If there is an adult with Wiki authority to lock in the links I have added similar to the manner in which the CIA links are locked in I have more integrity than they do and would NEVER consider deleting their links then I think we are all better off for  If not wwwossnet will remain up forever and continues to be the reference site for OSINTneither the government nor the vendors are honest on this topic
