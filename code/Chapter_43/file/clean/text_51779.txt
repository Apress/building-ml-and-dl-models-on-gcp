ACTA SOPA and Media Conflict of Interest 
Im writing you because if I read correctly the history of the ACTA article you reverted an addition I had made claiming the media have a conflict of interest in this issue  A few minutes ago I added a section to TalkAntiCounterfeiting Trade Agreement regarding  Media Conflict of Interest  Im quite confused by your reversion because a the definition of a conflict of interest seems to me to make this point quite clear without a citation b I provided a link to conflict of interestMedia where this issue is discussed in greater detail with substantive citations to appropriate academic quality literature and c the points I made should hardly classify as original research  If you have a chance please reply on  Media Conflict of Interest  Thanks
