Basically I think that you can either be supportive neutral or directly against  Even this discussion shows peoples views very clearly  Particularly you cant actually judge people by what others have done so people PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENSIVE  Its not right  An encyclopedia should be entirely neutral and show the views of both sides
