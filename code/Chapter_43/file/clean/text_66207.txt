Curcumin is essentially nonfluorescent and unstable in water A weak broad emission can be detected at 550 nm using 420 excitation In a nonpolar environment such as a lipid membrane or after curcumin binds to serum albumin the fluorescence is increased and blueshifted with a 498 nm emission maximum using 420nm excitationBiochim Biophysics Acta 1760 200615131520
