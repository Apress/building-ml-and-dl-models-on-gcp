High Res Map of Salt Spring Island 

Hello Ckatz I noticed that you deleted my link from the External Links section of the wikipedia entry on Salt Spring Island I am curious as to why you did this as it is the most valuable online resource pertaining to Salt Spring Island that is available The only searchable clickable street index for one thingand also the map is the only source for info pertaining to hiking trails routes and trailheads on Salt Spring Island The map found at httpwwwmapofsaltspringcommapofsaltspringpdf is in fact the most encycopedic source of info pertaining to avian and marine life in and around the island also

Please let me know why you did this

sincerely Kenneth M Fersht
