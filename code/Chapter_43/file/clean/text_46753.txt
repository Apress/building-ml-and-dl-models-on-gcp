One testicle 
I have heard from many people that Hitler had only one testical The article makes no mention of this even though I could find several sources from a recent google search Is this true or was it propaganda spread to make Hitler seem like less of a man Apparently Napoleon only has one testical as well It may make for interesting trivia
