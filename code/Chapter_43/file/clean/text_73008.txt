I have not problem with the Beowulf Its says that Hygelac was king of the geats But he was properly also king of some Danes probably from Sk√•ne area Since its also says that he was from the danish dynasty And both Saxo and Anglo writers call him dane and not geat
But no matter what This cant be used to call all Danes for Scandinavians Its also 300 years before Rollo Comanche cph
