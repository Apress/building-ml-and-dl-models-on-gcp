Salon is not a source without its POV biases and it certainly had a number of ideological axes to grind including most pertinently a willingness to tar and feather any and all Arab and Islamic peoples as barbarians and a totally uncritical way of looking at the IsraelPalestine conflict 

Accepting their claims as the total truth is certainly problematic it is made even more so when there isnt a way to actually check the veracity of the claim Not being able to read the article because of their damned clickthrough ads I would personally appreciate if someone could post the section of the article in question For the time being Salon claims   is certainly the NPOV way to go
