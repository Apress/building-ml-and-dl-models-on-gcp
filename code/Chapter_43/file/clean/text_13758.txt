Things are not this simple There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian candidates were banned from recent elections there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place Also Iraqs status as a US ally leave alone major US ally is questionable due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shia and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada alSadrs political party Also the insurgency is far from quelled although its not as deadly as it was around 20062007 with at least 4000 civilians 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth  1926 4 January 2011
