All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten  You Didnt 

 Share everything
 Play fair
 Dont hit people
 Put things back where you found them
 Clean up your own mess
 Dont take things that arent yours
 Say youre sorry when you hurt somebody
 Wash your hands before you eat
 Flush
 Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you
 Live a balanced life  learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some
 Take a nap every afternoon
 When you go out in the world watch out for traffic hold hands and stick together
 Be aware of wonder Remember the little seed in the Styrofoam cup the roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why but we are all like that
 Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam cup  they all die So do we
 And then remember the DickandJane books and the first word you learned  the biggest word of all  LOOK
