UserKiand  UserHu are Britanniphobic vandals 

It really angers me when I find that my articles have been vandalised It is the work of either or both of these serious offenders They have been warned that the next time they vandalise an article Ive written then theyre for the high jump Why should I waste my time fixing up what theyve
done I resent it when they rename an article from British Commonwealth to Commonwealth of Nations when the use of nation to describe a country is wrong The word nation is an ethnological term and should NEVER be used to describe a country So British Commonwealth remains in common use and it is a politically neutral term
