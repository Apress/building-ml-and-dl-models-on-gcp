See the Death Rock articles talk page for the reason behind the edits Also im talking about people who dont know anything about Death Rock or Gothic Metal associating the two See the Gothic Music article for this problem Also the pink line thing was a joke im sorry you didnt get it it was mainly a play on my affiliation with only wearing black and pink 

 General purpose of messaging you was in regards that some Death Rock bands and some Gothic Metal bands take influence from each other What also doesent help is that many people assume that several Doom Metal bands are Gothic Metal including the genres progenetors such as My Dying Bride and Theater of Tragedy This doesnt help when those Doom Metal bands in question are influenced by Death Rock bands causing people to mistake firstly the bands as Gothic Metal and then secondly Death Rock and Gothic Metal being associated Perhaps mentioning the influence that Death Rock bands had on Doom Metal bands would be good
