Then take it out if you want  This is a very popular article that is attracting many vandals several of whom have changed other stuff I put in it  I told you three times that I watched this television segment  I did not read a summary of it in a book or magazine  I saw and heard it  I remember what Janis parents were wearing and what their eyeglass frames were like  I did not tell the reader to go to the library in Baltimore  I said there is a 16 millimeter film copy of it there which doesnt mean its the only library that has it  It could be in a lot of libraries  

Since you evidently never have been to the Baltimore library then dont assume it has a cardcomputer entry  I checked out the reel of 16 millimeter film in 1984 after finding the title Janis Joplin in the film catalog  I told the film clerk it wasnt a librarian that I wanted to check out that title and he returned with it a few minutes later  All he needed was the title  I supplied the 16 millimeter projector which I no longer own  Do YOU know anyone who owns one   Several years later 1992 I heard a radio interview with Janis sister Laura promoting her book Love Janis in which a phone caller asked her if she recalled that 60 Minutes segment from shortly after Janis death  Laura corrected him saying it came from a primitive NBC news magazine show titled First Tuesday  I will try to split up those footnotes but I cant guarantee it  This article is so popular that I could be 90 percent done with typing the changes and then the system tells me I am in an edit war  The next time that happens I am going to give up and let people assume that Janis like everyone else who used hard drugs in the late 1960s was a lot like a Dragnet character and her parents were that dumb too  I will stick with her music You can make friends by talking about someones music but not by talking about First Tuesday   dooyar
