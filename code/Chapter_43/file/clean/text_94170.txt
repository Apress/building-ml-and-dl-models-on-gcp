This is about the Byzantium section not the whole article if you can get your mind around that idea we are making progress Again I repeat
No one is claiming 
Byzantiums invented the symbol
Byzantiums are the only ones to use the symbol
Mehmet II and the Ottomans definately copied the flag

So there is no need to drown the small section in repeated attempts to show that a turk at some point passed through a nation that had used the symbol at some point as a hopeless counter

What is being claimed

The flag of Byzantium crescent moon and star was flying over Byzantium when as the Turks arrived to lay siege
Byzantium was the first state to use the symbols as national state symbols

The fact that symbol is old has nothing to do with the Byzantium theory It is about how the Turks came to adopt the symbol not who invented it  It is already stated  above please read this carefully i will repeat It is already stated that the symbol has ancient roots above the section on Byzantium  What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS the Turks borrowed the symbols Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums  This however is obviously criptic to you and I am sure you will repeat your line about how Turks traveled through Babylon as some bizarre hope that it is relevant under this specific Byzantium section The board of mediation will have to look at this I am afraid
