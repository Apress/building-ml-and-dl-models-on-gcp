Blocked 

Ive extended your block to a week because I think 24 hours is too lenient here Youve clearly been using at least three accounts to stack votes at ITN if not elsewhere and so obciously that its almost as if you wanted to get blocked Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that Ive almost never seen before That you did this at ITN where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project makes this abuse even more shocking which is the reason Ive extended your block I will say the following once and once only if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities logged in or not in an attempt to stack votes I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban If I were you I would be spending the next week reflecting on how I could regain the trust of the community but if you attempt to evade this block you will be met with equally stiff sanctions   Penny for your thoughts
