Response to Gnangarra and a suggestion for a compromise 
IntroductionThanks Gnangarra for your comments Everyone interprets policies differently and this talk page is no exception to that There are two policies widely debated here which are WPBLP and WPUNDUE I am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page I did not include opinions from BLP notice board and individual members talk pages If I may have made mistakes unintentional in the summarisation please feel free to remind me and I will correct Now while Gnangarra Pete Skyring Suturz and Yeti Hunter think it is WPBLP violation MickMacNee Merbabu Orderinchaos Peter Ballard chaser Lester Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WPUNDUE MickMacNee Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont
