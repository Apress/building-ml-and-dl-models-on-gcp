I have tried multiple times both at wpani and at wpblpn to enlist administrators to keep the article on their watchlist and to consider helping mediate on the talk page  The only administrator who did attempt to assist was repeatedly attacked on his talk page for doing so and has yet to return  At this point I dont know of any other way to express my concerns that convey the sincerity and passion the issue deserves its someone life were allowing to be framed here  Its why the Foundation put forward such a notable Resolution  Its why wpblp exists and why special sanctions and enforcement were put forward

Yet venues for convincing administrators to roll up their sleeves and stick around dont exist and watchlist coverage of controversial but not incredibly widespread wpblps like Carly Fiorina are incredibly vulnerable regardless  The issue is when someone like Carly Fiorina decides to run for a Senate seat in a contest already projected to be the most expensive in the upcoming elections we end up getting caught with our pants down here at Wikipedia because we just dont have effective and thorough procedures surrounding wpblp in place  Like what happened with Sarah Palin coincidentally  Ive expressed this time and again and my post at wpani was the best I could do to convey what I believed to be the seriousness of the issue  As I said I dont know any other way to put it  userJ aka justen talk
