Allstarecho is correct in what he says There is no reference to malemale sexual relationships in the section Personal relationships Here is what it currently says in its entirety 
Jamess personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark with whom he fathered his children Growing up James did not have any parents for his father Henry Stuart Lord Darnley was murdered and his mother Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer James Hepburn 4th Earl of Bothwell His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood and he had no siblings103104
Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about Jamess sexuality The word relationships could mean anything depending I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean Englands as are concepts of male bonding friendship and whats acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods However there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates Call it what you will but excising that from the main article section is not fair Dont use modern terms if that is the issue Also the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long Footnote 24 is 117 words I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it including the assertion that it is murky and debated  Even if that section is shorter as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about Jamess sexuality Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion That seems fair and balanced something that I wish to work toward But to excise mention of anything other than platonicfamily relations from the main article is not Sorry but footnotes dont count People just dont generally read them
