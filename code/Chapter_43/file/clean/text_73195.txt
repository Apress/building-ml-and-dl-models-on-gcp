Wikipedia is Wicked Wonderful 

Thank you so much for your previous reply and kind words

Regarding WebCite Ive decided not to go crazy with it Ill preserve it for those excessively long  loathsome URLS Im relieved you think WebCite is a good thing

Im still flustered about citations notes and bibliographies I tried 
mixing embedded URLS with   and  but it didnt work Then I gave up and just used the  commands But it just doesnt look as nice
