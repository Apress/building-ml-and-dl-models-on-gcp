Its funny Im much more in the Burma camp yet I agree with this assessment it is unfair that Myanmar looses on a tie and Burma wins Because the ball stopped on the Burma side of the net before arbitration Myanmar got the short end of the stick Im happy with the result but not in how it got there and as I said from the start there was not going to be a good ending either way Im not faulting our jury either they just did an impossible thankless job on their own time and made a decision that had to be made Gosh we just had a couple of US Supreme Court judgments handed down today that went 54 and 63 and they had a lot more information to make their findings
