Possible amicus appeals 

I thought this comment might be of interest It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made Under the circumstances I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened maybe at ANI requesting the block be lifted or if that proves unsuccessful or doesnt appeal to you requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others Under the circumstances I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding Alternately I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the cword might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own 

The question of whether you want to appeal is obviously your choice But whether you choose to or not I would be interested in knowing what you might think of maybe requesting discretionary sanctions regarding further misrepresentation

And for what little it might be worth if nothing else I hope you can take advantage of the admittedly unrequested break you are having to maybe enjoy being away from the dramah here for awhile
