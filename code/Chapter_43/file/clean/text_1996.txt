Hannibal  

Like I said earlier the only thing Id comment on is that the books section should be expandedthe bulk of the plots of Red Dragon and Silence are ignored save for Lecter being captured and escaping We dont need a CliffNotes of the novels but we should mention how Lecter worked with both Graham and Clarice and how he was connected with Francis Dolarhyde Again a paragraph or two for each book would do
