Cant you follow wikipedia rules Pray and you put something in I reverted and no one should revert me until a consensus has been reached Yet you keep reverting dont discuss and there is no consensus You didnt moan on the AO page when the stupid round table crap was removed so stop digging in things are changing around here Sourcing and prose are a must if you dont like it edit something else
