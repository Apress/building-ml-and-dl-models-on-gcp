Hey PS
     Yes you are right I have not lived in Kerala in the past 2 years That doesnt mean I am not familiar with it Now Amrita TV is not a TV channel watched by the masses They watch Surya Asianet or Kairali If you have been seen on this channel it means to me in my biased opinion that you are not too famous to have an article in wikipedia Also remember that there are many singers who have cut their own records That doesnt mean they have to have an article too
    Plus I am a frequent listener to malayalam film songs and I have certainly not heard of you Do not waste your time ranting about whether the article should be deleted or not Instead focus your energy on singing and becoming famous and then having someone else to have an article written about you This letter may make you more angry but I am sorry

Ave
