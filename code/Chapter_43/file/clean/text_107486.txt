Hopefull 

Dear UserAddhoc I am hopeful regarding the appeal for Justice made by UserLakki Marwat You are having good record impression and pleasant attitude Otherwise I am hopeless to make a plea to most of the Administrators on WP as it is hard to achieve justice by them As you are a senior member of WPKC you must be kind to me even if I am wrong So you correct me in a lovely manner as a human deserves to be corrected in such a way

Here I must tell you one thing humbly that I dont want to discuss the edits on the article Marwat I believe the edits should be into discussion at articles discussion page Where no one likes to discuss but keep on approaching administrations for their help

Anyhow I just would like to make you know one thing by drawing your attention towards article Marwat that is vandalise by one of the fellow who is having almost similar username to article 

If you visit the Discussion Page of article Marwat you will find a paragraph 19 written by UserMarwatt In that paragraph 19 heading and first line is written in pure Pashto Language the headline and firstline is quoted below in bold 

 Quoted 

Kasam Pe Khduai Ka de rana We Lekal

Ter so pore che ze zamdai yem Wala ka rana Akhtar Munir ya nor fazoolyat pe de article che wachai End of Quoting

The menaiong of these two lines is That I vow to God that I wont let you write Till I am alive I swear upon Allah God you cant mention the name of Akhter Munir in this article 

Addhoc doesnt this means that this is a challenge and there is a personal enmity political enmity besides this editing vandalism 

See the discussion page of that article UserMarwatt is fail to defend his editdeletes clearly

If you take an interest in resolving the dispute and issue of editing for article Marwat I am sure the page will get a rest and updating instead of being a battleground for my fellows

Thanking you for your personal attention
