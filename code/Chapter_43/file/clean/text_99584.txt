cont Unfortunately the recent editing of WikipediaPublic domain does not help this situation  I had done a search for images of Nazi regime US copyright law and been directed via Wapedia Wikipedia for mobile telephones to the following section which was edited recently and has many missing citations and cannot therefore be used as a source for determining the propriety of how to license these images  See   That is a copy of the content guideline WikipediaPublic domain which has been edited recently by the uploader of the images whose licensing is under review such edits are highly questionable as the content guideline appears to be edited to support a position re specific images currently under review a past or potential edit war see WikipediaEdit warring and WikipediaDisruptive editing for guidance  Editing content guidelines and policy pages in Wikipedia when involved in a difference of viewpoints re specific content is highly problematic and frowned upon especially if it is done wo following WPCITE and WPVSources

contIve added the missing citations templates and an editorial interpolation and a comment explaining the templates on the talk page at in that articles talk page  This is an alert to the potential problem of a feedback loop occurring in Wikipedia to validate images whose status is still under review pertaining to WPIUP and WPPUI  This is merely an expression of concern see WikipediaGuidelines for controversial articles already in a template at top  When adding material to controversial articles or controversial sections of articles or content guidelines in Wikipedia it is still necessary to avoid violating WPNOR and to follow WPV and WikipediaNeutral point of view these are core editing policies in Wikipedia
