Adolfo Farsari

Thank you for your intelligent edits which cut some flab Ive reluctantly and provisionally reverted you in two places however in those two places I think that the previous awkward wording had some purpose I know little about Farsari however Ill wait to see what Pinkville thinks If he thinks my reversions were unnecessary Ill be delighted Im all in favor of cutting awkwardness
