Redirection from Machine Translations means no link to the musical act of that name 

As subject says when I enter machine translations in to Wiki search it redirects directly to this page Yet there is a wikipedia page called Machine Translations discussing to the musical act of that name To get to that page I have to search for J Walker machine translations in its entirety Could some competent wiki editor fix this situation please
