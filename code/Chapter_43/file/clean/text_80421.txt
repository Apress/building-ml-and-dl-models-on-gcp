After a little more searching via Google I now finally realise that the crude reproduction published by FremontBarnes is actually of the painting discussed by Robinson and illustrated by him in BW on page 235 I have not discovered where the painting is now It is however available in variable colour on at least two internet sites Here

What is odd is that FremontBarnes has reversed the sense in his reproduction which confused me for a while
On page 235 Robinson states that he has little doubt that this is the version Kirkall used Kirkalls mezzotint is in the reverse sense of the original It is perfectly obvious that although this original may not have been painted by the Younger van de Velde and certainly not by the Elder it was equally certainly not painted by Peter Monamy

This is a very disagreeable and unpleasant discussion I realise that your inadequate research is being exposed and Im sorry it upsets you  I recommend that you take a good look at Robinsons opus He is far more reliable than the sources you quote and that includes Callender who perpetrated a number of incredible howlers in his writings
