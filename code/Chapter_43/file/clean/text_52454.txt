As a Wikipedia I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit 

On Neutral Point of View

 I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the studies done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine Merck Clearly these people who receive hundredthousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off themBesides 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was safe shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe 

Verifiability 

I provided valid links 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died 88 of such cases can be found on the website The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousanddollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and WyethFor deaths associated with Rotateq

Original Research

 This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe 

Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines I was repeatedly blocked by UserMastCell my citations deleted Some were on the excuse of libelous but they were all factually verifiable and had cited sources So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how UserMastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedias guidelines as a responsible administrator Angered he has blocked me indefinitely for personal attacks when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as libelous Ironically MastCell violates all of the above His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merckfunded Association his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable correct and unobjective his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of studies essentially funded and determined by the drugs own manufacturers Therefore I appeal to nullify my weeklong blocking I would also suggest blocking UserMastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator the basis on which he has used to block me
