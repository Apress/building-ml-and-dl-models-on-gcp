Walt Disney World for Australians link
Please stop adding the Walt Disney World for Australians external link to the Walt Disney World Resort article again and again The link is of little value See this comment from the articles discussion page
Wikipedia is not a place to link news and fan sites because if we link any then we have to link all of them and there are way too many out there Its not hard to find news sites or fan sites out there  just use Google or Dmoz or any of hundreds of other directories or search engines Im deleting these links because they dont directly contribute to anything in the article If you want to add an External Link to an article on one of these sites that specifically adds more detail to something covered in the article then that would be fine See WikipediaExternal links specifically the Maybe OK to add and What should not be linked to sections
