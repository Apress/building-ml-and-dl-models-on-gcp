Well I was looking the history of  the Saw VI article from this time last year and the talk page where I first started contributing and theres was quite a few regular editors  Now I dont see them anymore  Saw VI is a GA and is going through a peer review to get ready for a FAC  It would help if there were anymore offline sources to add  I added some of the bits from the Fangoria Do you know if there were more magazines that had any Saw VI info last year  Saw 3D is shaping up nicely its protected until October can you believe that so I dont have to worry with that much  If you havent been keeping up Dr G is back and is confirmed to be the last one D  Â Allen
