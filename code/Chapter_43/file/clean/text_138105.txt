Haha this is pretty funny AlBargit you deleted my communist box and you were allowed to keep yours I would love to support you on this but frankly you are a victim of what you complain against I left English Wiki for reasons stated on my userpage This is a bias community You will always have people like Kuban on the English wiki who are obsessed with quoting rules to always get the Sysops side no matter how hypocritical it is Remember always History is written by the winners unfortunately Chechnya will never have its say of what happened or their side because they are still under unfortunately Russian control Anyway good luck with your retirement of English Wiki it feels great being able to put time into Icelandic and Chechen wikis ones who truly stand for neutrality
