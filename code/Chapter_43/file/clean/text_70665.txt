First I want to mention that I deeply appreciate your candid frank and friendly response  It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesnt see any need to bite someones head off just because of a mistake whatever the size  Not that most Wikipedians do that but cordiality is still nice  Yes I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other peoples comments  For me the ill will is a much bigger factor especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment but it is still a risk as you say

Youre right the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there  These are trivial changes but I find value in them  It is true that the servers dont spend much time on redirects but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP or even EN WP but I can help  Actually I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects which would be a problem and one worth fixing  Being a perfectionist I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects I want a nice clean Whatlinkshere page with no indentions   A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on main namespace pages not on talk pages and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong since that should be right  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages  On talk pages and even in archives I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target but I think Ill change my policy based on your wellmade point Im only going to change the link target nothing about the appearance  Does that seem reasonable

I am interested in AWB but I havent really looked into it much  Thanks for the tip

My login problem is a toughie as far as I can tell  What happens is this I click the registerlogin link at the top right of the page  I enter my username and password  It says I have successfully logged in and even shows my username etc in the upper right  But then as soon as I switch to another page I am logged out again  I have checked my cookies and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that Im working on  It is possible it is a firewall problem but I have no idea how to fix that  And it isnt just at the school where I work I cant login on computers in cybercafes in the area either  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something but I never had this problem until around December 2006 which was about the time our school changed its ISP  I dont know if that is related but if that is the case it seems strange that I cant even login when Im offcampus  A bit of a puzzler isnt it

BTW if you dont mind me saying so I noticed that your contribs link in your signature doesnt go to your contributions page  The link should read SpecialContributionsFlex not SpecialContributionsFlex  Better to catch it now than later
