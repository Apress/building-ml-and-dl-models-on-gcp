Thank You 

Not sure how else to contact you Hope you dont mind me posting here Thank you for reviewing my unblock request I appreciate your taking the time to examine the issue in order to make what I needless to say think was a fair judgment

As I already expressed on the Talk page prior to the 7 day block its proven futile for me to try to maintain the agreed version pending revision through further discussion and consensus as my efforts to undo the reverts of people who refuse to make any kind of effort to discuss their objections on Talk continually well twice prior to this 7 day thing which doesnt count on this point result in me getting blocked Thus as I said on Talk Im going to stick with helping LingNut get his rewrite ready I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensusforming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objectionssuggestions etc If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard I would appreciate it And its probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed versions will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me I just want to see this article improved including by keeping it in compliance with WPNPOV Thanks again Cheers
