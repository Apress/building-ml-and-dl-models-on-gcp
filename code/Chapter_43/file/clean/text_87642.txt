I need to quote you on this part  You said edits to your own user and user talk pages are in violation of WPCIVIL and WPNPA  But its okay for  to delete the talk page at TalkNorthPark Center  In case you dont know he did delete the talk page but only put it on the archive folder after I reverted his action  I think you need to take reading classes
