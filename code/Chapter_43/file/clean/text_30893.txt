You are misinterpreting the rules again   Here is what Wikipedia  What Ignore all rules means says 
 
Ignore all rules is one of Wikipedias core policies  What it means is what it says  In particular it means ignore this page  You should not feel you need to read this nor any other rule before contributing to Wikipedia    emphasis added
 
1 You are not required to learn the rules before contributing emphasis added
