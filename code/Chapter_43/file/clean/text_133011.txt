Thank you again The passport picture had no problem in regards to the concern you raised above Why delete that Also the 22 sheduled languages have also been decided by earlier governments  By the way India did not choose a National language in order to not piss off the 23 muslims that live here But that can not be proved However I since Bharat Ganrajya is a Hindi word why is it even mentioned it then Why not simply Republic of India BECAUSE Hindi is important is many way  Official Language used in govt IDs and documents So if ONE HAS TO WRITE BHARAT GANRAJYA why not write it in its indigenous script too Dont write it then Bharat Ganrajya has different names in the 800 languages spoken in India Why write Bharat Ganrajya the Hindi version only  I hope you try to understand Cheers to you too
