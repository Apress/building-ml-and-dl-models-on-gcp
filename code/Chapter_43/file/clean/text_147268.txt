I understand your intentions and agree with many of your points However I dont believe that this is an article that should place technical accuracy above comprehension I do think that many people will be puzzled by seeing MiBs and KiBs even with the Wikilinks The average reader of this article is a gamer not a computer scientist This article is different from the hard drive article because that articles discusses the topic of marketing capacity vs true capacity I wouldnt be opposed to including both measurements like the hard drive article but only including IEC prefixes doesnt seem to be the best course of action   Talk 1529 16 Jun 2005 UTC
