I think the original explanation was terrible I also think that the explanation based on g Ec2 makes no sense whatsoever In effect it encourages the people that claim that the photons have an equivalent mass mEc2 which is totally wrong Come to think of it the whole page misses the fact that current experiments put a limit of 61017 eV on the photon mass with newer experiments set to lower this limit This limit is in total contradiction with any type of Ec2 derivation If you dont like my explanation of photon in the box could you please remove the entry altogether It is very misleading and badly written as originally set Thank you
