The reason I didnt respond to the ping above is that I dont waste my time with trolls If youre claiming that you wrote
Posting on my talk page multiple times after demanding that I not post on your talk page is obviously hypocritical I treat people incredibly well the first time I meet them and then treat them exactly how they treat me The hypocrisy youre invoking probably has its roots in childhood where you experienced relationships in which you were aggressively forbidden from speaking by people that forced you to listen to what they had to say Your actions in adulthood likely reflect unexamined and unresolved childhood experiences You have my sympathies and my offer to privately help you if you ever want to discuss them
on someones talk page in good faith and didnt realise how grossly offensive it was then I simply dont believe you In fact your and then treat them exactly how they treat me clause makes it explicit that you were not acting in good faith
