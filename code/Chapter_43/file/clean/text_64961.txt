I rode on the Nindawayma back in the summer of 89  Of course that was many years ago now and she was in a lot better shape back then  The rumours about her not being able to handle the rough weather are true which is why she was only in service during the highpeak months of JulyAugust  She indeed did have a lot of mechanical problemsmostly eletrical and hydraulic related but yes her enginesPielsticks were also fussy and burned an obscene amount of fuel  Ontario Northland who wereare the former owners took a huge financial loss as they paid 13 million for the vessel while she was only in service for four seasons from 19891992  In contrast the ChiCheemaun has been in service for 32 years now  Meanwhile the big canoe is spending the winter in Sarnia Ontario undergoing a major refit which reportedly includes new engines stabilizers and some interior modifications as well  Regular sailing will resume in May 2007
