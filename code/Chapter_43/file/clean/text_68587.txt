Trivia last time 

See this edit in which  who edits little else besides this article this section claims that there is consensus on this talk page for this horrible selection of trivia The trivia here is nothing but insignificant mentions and some other tripe including an originallyresearched claim that its close to some location in a 19thcentury novel just to indicate the level of encyclopedic discourse and what can only be described as a combination of trivia and spam in the link to the SCP Foundation Web Site whatever it is I mean Ive seen some trivia in my time but this beats almost all of them Ill let it stand so you can see how trivial it is even though it totally rubs me the wrong way So heres what I propose we take care of this once and for all In the abovelinked diff Kothog claims consensuswell there isnt Theres a bit of discussion but nothing like consensus So I invite every interested party including previous participants to settle it Names I see on this talk page who have discussed this matter include           

Proposal
In agreement with Wikipedia practice common sense with WPTRIVIA with WPV and with WikipediaIn popular culture content I propose that the trivia section or whatever its to be called will contain only entries that are rigorously verified with reliable secondary sources as to correctness and relevance just that it is mentioned isnt enough it needs to be established that it matters
