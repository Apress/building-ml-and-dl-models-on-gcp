Adventures of Tintin 

Hello 
Why have you moved Adventured of Tintin to Adventures of Tintin when the page is on requested move back to its original name which is Minor characters in Tintin Before moving a page you must have a look at its history and talk page to avoid mistakes like this the page was moved from AB and I requested an admin to move it back to A which is clearly indicated on the talk page and which I cannot do myself because page A has been edited meanwhile but then you move it from BC which further complicates the matter
