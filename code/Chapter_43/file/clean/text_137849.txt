Therell never be any consensus because Randians like SteveWolfer consider LaVey to be a wacko and are embarassed by the fact that LaVey formed Satanism based largely on Objectivism Call me nuts but it looks to me like Steves such a big fan of Rand that hes willing to censor the article to make his hero look perfect  This is coming from the same guy whos editwarred to hide the fact that Nathaniel Branden doesnt have an accredited PhD Now I knew coming into this that it was a waste of time but I tried anyhow  Im sorry I did and I completely give up Go ahead and hide whatever truth makes you antsy  Im never editing Wikipedia again thanks to people like you and Steve
