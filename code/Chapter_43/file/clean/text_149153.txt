Third Reich related advice 

PA  I just wanted to make a suggestion to you for dealing with the Third Reich articles youve shown an interest in  I happen to think theres some value per NPOV in what youre trying to add but these articles need better sourcing and more tact than other articles and you have been using such to date  Remember there are still a lot of people in the world with hairtriggers on the subject of Naziism and any unreasonableness tends to magnify exponentially  There are decent secondary sources for what you are trying to say so give up the confrontational language stick closely to facts and sources and try to make reasoned arguments as best you can  If you can keep things calm on the talk page youll be able to make fruitful additions to the article  Ludwigs2
