From an admin  we cant expect such reason you removed Propdelition tag without seeing its tag or the notices concerning no citation or references which are intact for years Now because of your this mistake the same Dubious articles will remain on Wikipedia This is one of the biggest backdrop of wikipedia admin who dont have expertise in any subject treat all editors as inferior make edits without even looking at its talk page or notices regarding citations  Now other editor will come and claim that prop deletion tag was removed go to Afd and it will go unnoticed their for months and such articles without any citations and some of them are on Personality who never existed will continue on Wikipedia So its my due request that you must give it due attention that such articles are deleted when their time limit of Prop Deletion runs out Now because you removed the Prop Del tag without any reason other Admin might claim that this is not noncontroversial so you must took notice of this and must act accordingly when their time limit runs out As admin you are entrusted with responsibility but your recent removal of those tags dont show any maturity Atleast you should have talked on its Discussion Page instead of acting like Big daddy  you yourself can see that citation tags are their for many years so source or citation are not net to back these articles infact i doubt that any such personaility ever existed So hoepfully you will rectify your mistake Thnx
