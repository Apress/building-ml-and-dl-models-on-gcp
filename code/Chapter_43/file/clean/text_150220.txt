help with course of action concerning possible infringement 

Hello Kevin

Its evening here in Romania and Im back on WP Thanks for your offer to help
Heres the story in a nutshell
I went to school with a famous sportsperson and multiple Olympic champion and shes still a rather close friend Needless to say none of the existing WP articles about her were written by me because despite the notability being out of question I felt I couldnt be objective But those articles exist
Yesterday she brought to my attention that a book was published in the Statesapparently in 2010 containing her biography and with the statement  on the cover that it was based on high quality Wikipedia articles She says that according to what she was told it sells on Amazon for 50 USD48 EUR and that she would send me a link from the BarnesNoble website There are several issues here first both she and I dont think its ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person and at least her business address is widely known Secondly and which has to do directly with Wikipedia both she and I dont believe that one can just like that copy paste content that is made available for free and make profit out of it how much of this book did the authors actually work for we dont know because we dont have it yet but they take pride in basing it on wp which  is not a good sign

OK I tried to read my way through the terms of use pages read about the new terms of use too although probably they shouldnt apply retroactively but I couldnt get a clear picture of what applies here and what can be done Ill come back with the link when I get it Thanks again
