I sense a disturbance in the Wiki request 

Though I might be jumping at shadows I noticed that after this I started getting anons placing welcome templates on my Usertalk 1 2 having no obvious geographic similarity Its just odd  I didnt even get a welcome template when I started my account and here i am 1600 edits in and Im getting two of them 
From anons
Could I ask you to semiprotect my pages for a few days or so If I am to understand correctly it means that newer users wont be able to post but Im kinda hoping that whoevers pranking me gets bored and finds something shiny to play with
