Sounds good  Id try talking them through various different approaches  obviously content partnerships with examples of preexisting ones but also things like us helping them with digitization of particularly important works andor proofreading for texts Wikipedian in Residence Backstage Passstyle events putting curators in contact with wikipedia editors and generally sharing knowledge getting them using Wikipedia contentlinks on their websitein their displays etc Dont focus too narrowly on one of these to start with but see what they are interested in initially and then press on with that
 Let me know if you need any official representation or other support from WMUK eg if you want me to come talk to them with you if there is content that needs uploading in bulk or agreements signing etc Also if you need any financial support at any point let us know  if under 100 then via the microgrants process or if over then get in touch Basically if theres anything we can do to help let us know 
 Good luck
