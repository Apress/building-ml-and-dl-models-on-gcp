differentiation
when i went to school and studied geography the state curriculum required that we differentiat between global warmingclimate change and the green house effect theory if we diddnt we lost marks i realise you are not trying to pass any exams but i still feel you should clearly differentiate betwen fact and theory and please dont give the old argument about scientific consensus firstly because people will start to argue about that and secondly because it makes no difference for example there is overwhelming consensus on the theory of evolution but you hardly ever see it without its theory tag
