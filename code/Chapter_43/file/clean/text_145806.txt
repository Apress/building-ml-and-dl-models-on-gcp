Agreed that this article should concentrate on Obamas positions not their policy effect or what opinions people have of them  Outside views are okay in terms of analyzing and getting to the heart of things  neutral independent reliable secondary sourcing is better than simply picking and choosing among Obamas diect statements  But outside opinions either reported directly by primary sourcing or coverage of those opinions are not relevant and would turn this article into something else that is far less encyclopedic  One thing to note as Ive pointed out before is that positions is a nebulous thing because it encompasses campaign promises and platforms official statements legislative proposals actual official acts and coverage of Obamas actual beliefs and motivations on things  Thats a lot of different things to wrap up in a bundle and we should be clear to distinguish among them
