Yes for the record I acknowledge that my latest outburst was completely unjustified since Wikipedia policy specifically allows removal of requests for medical or legal advice  This is NOT to be construed as an apology to Baseball Bugs which I am not making and never will  However as far as double jeopardy this applies regardless of Wikipedia policy  it stems from my Constitutional rights as an American  So while you could convert the block into an indefinite ban you can ONLY do this in case of further wrongdoing on my part 24512213
