Observation duly noted with this response

It isnt just that elements of Frenchs affidavit is based on other peoples stories  the fact is he swore that all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct  And that included second and thirdhand gossip about Kerrys military record in Vietnam  This guy is  an officer of the court I find it hard to believe he didnt know what he was doing 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in atrocities lets consider what Kerry actually said

 SEN KERRY There are all kinds of atrocities and I would have to say that yes yes I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones I conducted harassment and interdiction fire I used 50 calibre machine guns which we were granted and ordered to use which were our only weapon against people I took part in search and destroy missions in the burning of villages  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down And I believe that the men who designed these the men who designed the free fire zone the men who ordered us the men who signed off the air raid strike areas I think these men by the letter of the law the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley are war criminals   

Those sorts of things took place and were documented as taking place  and in fact were mostly SOP Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmanns tactics distasteful  French is not being truthful or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesnt think these things should be referred to as atrocities a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying 

And compare Frenchs description of Kerrys mutiny remark with what he actually said

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very very hard to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny say I would not go back on the rivers again  

A little different from claiming that he said crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny isnt it  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies read Brinkley for instance and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmanns orders   Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RFPF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support   French is knocking down his own strawman

I think theres plenty to question in the other affidavits especially Elliotts and Letsons but again I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section
