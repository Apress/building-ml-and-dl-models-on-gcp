Suspected why doesnt he PROVE it there are logs history here please check the ip user page and check what kinu DELETED Also check that kinu banned me because he felt attacked not a particularly good person to be the judge Even more and so we dont fall on the same discussion dont continue with the discussion about the ownership of the talk page It doesnt matter my opinion about that now because I was already banned for that and i fullfilled that ban I was NOW banned because I readded two lines that kinu had deleted to a user page those lines werent particularly offensive Then kinu added that I created an account COME ON that was what everyone was asking for BTW he added that account to a deletion page but you can check it too from the ip mentioned

So Im banned 3 months NOT BECAUSE OF THE DISCUSSION about the ownership of user pages I was already banned for that but for
  Undeleting something that kinu deleted without giving reasons Note that we are NOT discussing the veracity of those statements unless you think people should be banned for asking
  Later kinu added that i created a troll or something like that account How I didnt have an account so how I used it to add the sentences mentioned if your policy is dont delete unless offensive then why was it deleted Furthermore if you check the discussions youll see that they where kept on my user page
  Finally kinu added that I was abusing the unblock template well what could I do kinu baned me and so went any posibility to appeal Most admins dont read user pages unless you add that template of course Ill accept that final ban agreed with WP policies but I had no other choice and it was a cheap way for kinu to silence me I dont think I should be banned for this because kinu clearly showed being arbitrary but if you think this later ban should stay then think if it should stay for 3 months

Im sure someone will say that this is a sockpuppet account I have no problems to continue this discussion on my initial userpage and having this one deleted but I need to be able to edit it
I ask any reviewer ANY admins or users to check my changes AFTER my last ban and see for yourselves if what Im saying is right or not
