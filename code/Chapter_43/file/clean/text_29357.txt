Did you even read the VARTV article IF you known anything about radio or have worked in Radio You would see the information I Provided about WCDX is accurate Just look at the History of the call letters or why dont you do the research yourself Since YOUR right and everyone else is wrong

Youve deleted each stations History in the Richmond Market What have you got again the History of these stations Maybe you arent aware but There was no Clear Channel or Radio One 20 years ago People who really Loved what Radio used to be enjoy reading the History of the Stations

Get Over Yourself Sir Its Not all about You
