Okay I agree that Dark Swords needs alittle reworking to read more like an encyclopedia entry It really just needs reworked I dont think it has either a notability or advertisement issue It just needs to bland general description separated from its gory inner feature list so that new comers can read a plain description and continue on to the over descriptive description if they choose to
