This thread is a good reminder of why I dont edit Wikipedia any more Erics original post was only mildly provocative by his standards and to be provoked by it someone has to go out of their way and read Erics talk page But those who want to be provoked chooses to look finds an excuse and flounces off to AE Then the initial posters at AE see that it is flouncing and the consensus is to take no action but along comes someone who is supposedly one of the most senior supervisors on this project and blocks Eric against consensus On a serious encyclopaedia a senior supervisor would have a name prefixed by Dr or Prof but here senior professors go by oh so clever puns such as Gorilla Warfare a name suggestive that its user sees herself as fighting a war against the type of brawny sexist male who gets referred to commonly as a gorilla In other places this might be taken to imply that said senior administrator has a point of view that might get in the way of taking an impartial view latest Erics display of chestthumping but on Wikipedia she can do what she wants Wikipedia isnt about the wisdom of the crowd its all about the baying of a mob stirred up by political agitators
