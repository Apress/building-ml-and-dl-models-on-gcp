You seem to work on hearsay not on original sourses Where Hansen did predict that In his 1985 Nature paper he gives quite conservative predictions Last year discoveries about increased ice sheet melting made some researchers increase the predictions from 03 to 10 m per century see for example the Science Magazine 2006 Science Breakthough 3 I believe the several feet prediction you write about was also supposed to happen in a century or two Dont be so hasty It will come in due time
Also your claims that satellites do not see global warming is simply rehashing old arguments that have been already refuted Wentz and Schabel 1998 who discovered that the original satellite data published in 1995 was not adjusted for the natural decay of spacecraft altitude caused by atmospheric drag and all debate that followed for example the Science papers on the subject I would not agree that the Hockey Stick has been recognized as fraud It is Mann the main fraudster not von Storch the sceptic after all who is given the priviledge to write the newest review paper on the subject Michael E Mann 2007 Climate Over the Past Two Millennia 
Enough for now Do you have any sources of your own to match these
