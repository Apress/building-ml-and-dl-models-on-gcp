POVESSAYSYNTHTRIVIA tags added 

This article has all the very same problems that the Chinese Canadians in British Columbia article has and the reasons are laid out on the talkpage there they have been ignored by the shepherding editor here who is unconcerned with and doesnt care about WPNPOV which is policy  Numerous guidelines are violated I wont waste my breath but somewhere along teh way someone who does not share the biased views and scholastic premises that the OWN author of this article has laid out and will recognize the incredibly bad English composition and the use of pasting together cherrypicked items to build SYNTHPOVso very obvious  Honestly I think these tags are more than deserved to paraphrase the edit comment of their illicit removal from the CCinBC article by the sole author here who successfully lobbied to have me blocked so he was not interfered with  What has been interfered with is BC history with a very clear ethnopolitical bias and soapbox agenda

I am leaving Wikipedia I will not waste my efforts any longer for a place where travesty like this was mollycoddled and nurtured in violations of several guidelines and also of the NPOV policy  this article is a political tract rife with synthesis and cherrypicked sources and distortions of others  tiresome and juvenile and a good demonstration of why Wikipedia is not real encyclopedia but more and more a compilation of jejune essays  and outright propaganda
