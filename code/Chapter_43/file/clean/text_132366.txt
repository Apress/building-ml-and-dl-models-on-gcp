Unfortunately your decision is a bad day for common sense By reversing his block you have given him the green light to do as he wishes Furthermore you have also now made a personal attack against me I was trying to help clear up what I saw  when I checked his edit history this afternoon  to be a longstanding problem which nobody appears to be willing to address It seems whenever one tries to stand up to the bullies one comes away with a bloody nose for ones troubles Well on your heads be it Its unsurprising that Wikipedia is seen as such an unreliable source in the press when people such as this are given carte blanche to do what they want I am a journalist so ought to know I would request a third opinion but see little point in it and I feel I have no choice other than to leave Wikipedia I cannot be involved with a project that appears to condone this behaviour Congratulations must go to both yourself and Mr Green for this Dont bother posting a reply on my talk page because I wont be here to read it Goodnight 86147218231
