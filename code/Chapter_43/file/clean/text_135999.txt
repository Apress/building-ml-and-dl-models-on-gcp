I do not agree with you about that at all In fact Kerrys Senate Office web site displays in great detail the history of each and every bill that Kerry has sponsored over the last 10 years Sponsorship of bills which eventually become law is indeed a measure of a Senators effectiveness That being the case raw data about numbers and eventual results do matter

 Now as to the point you make which is that there are also other measures of effectiveness That indeed can be true but I can find no data trail on Kerrys Sentate Office web site which supplies me with information about any bills which Kerry either as an significant amender or as a cosponsor helped become law I would like to see some information about bills which Kerry cosponsored which became law I am sure there are some I just havent located any data which corroorates that have you  Also the raw statistics about what did and did not become law is a concise window into this area In addition to the table showing numerical results what else do you suggest we add to give a more detailed view into Kerrys work product in the Senate
