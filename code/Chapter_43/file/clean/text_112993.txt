Speedy deletion for untagged images 

Hello there I notice that you have added I4 speedy deletion notices to some images that have been untagged for more than seven days Note that this is not necessary as images which are marked as untagged for more than seven days are automatically eligible for speedy deletion via CSD I4 For example all the items in CategoryImages with no copyright tag as of 1 October 2006 which includes some of the items you tagged are eligible and will be deleted any time now Hope this helps
