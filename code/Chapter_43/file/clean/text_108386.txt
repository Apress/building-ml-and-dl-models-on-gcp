OMG fun SO I edited a sandbox that I could not do if I was blocked But I wanted to see what would happen if I logged back in Almost clever architecture Now how about a cycle my IP  But in all seriousness I can be fine with a 24 hr block without calling other editors cunts I think it was a terrible block since other actions could have been taken If I ever get blocked for a longer amount of time I will certainly go for it but I would prefer to keep by barnstars and not have to lie to people I consider wikibuddies in an attempt to circumvent blocks So Nableezy We cannot discuss your problematic edits here until your topic ban is up You can ask all the questions you want and play games but I cannot answer you without baiting you And if you did respond I would take you to AE But really do feel free to shoot me a email and I will make sure cancer is the least worrisome words See you in two months
