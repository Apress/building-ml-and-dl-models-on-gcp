Nes for both of you guys there ARE controversial topics it does not mean
they do not exist and should not be discussed    When Bush is controversial then its ok to hang him on a skewer right but Saddam the modern Sister Theresa should be handled with rosewater gloves since his papa beat him poor lollypop and then its completely understandable why he has these orientalist urges to drop a few Kurd villages for breakfast right only natural See it from his position 

You guys are driving civilization downhill
