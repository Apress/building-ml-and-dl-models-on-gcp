The Alberta and Quebec examples look limited Even the Feature Article Geography of India is not going to win any comprehensiveness awards Maybe Im too ambitious but I propose the following structure
Biophysical Geography
Terrain
Mountains
Water
Climate
Ecosystems
Human Geogarphy
Population
Migration
Urban
Rural
Economic Geography
Resource Extraction
Manufacturing
Service
Tourism and Recreation
Political Geography
Municipalities
Regional Districts
Federal and Provincial Politics

Im not confident about Manufacturing and Service as separate sections because they seem too limited I also not confident about lumping Ecosystems into Physical Geography because Ecosystems will be by far the largest section and this can probably be linked with climate a lot better in a separate Bioclimatic Geography section
