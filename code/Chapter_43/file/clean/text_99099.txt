Actually here we have a German who was an eyewitness  we seem to love eyewitnesses except those who disagree with us it appears The idea that such a large project  the holocaust  could be done with so many people and over such a large time period without any documentation is well it needs a lot of eyewitnesses to make up for the deficient  far more than we have I would suggest The documents that are available  tons of them  all point away from a holocaust The Germans may not have known or saw anything for the simple reason that there may not have been anything to know or see Also no group even Germans  are that good at keeping secrets and running giant governmental burearucies by word of mouth15910580141
