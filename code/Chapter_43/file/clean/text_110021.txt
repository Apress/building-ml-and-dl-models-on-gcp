Restoring WPNPOV to the Paris article

I invite everyone to read again the WPNPOV policy of Wikipedia
Editing from a neutral point of view NPOV means representing fairly proportionately and as far as possible without bias all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it

Currently the article is heavily biased towards a historicalheritage representation of Paris The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History heritage sites tourism and past culture The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasnt been destroyed by a volcano 2000 years ago and here goes the WPPOV

Facts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom For the good of the debate here are some facts about todays Paris we should all remember Economically speaking Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York Demographically speaking it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world Regarding infrastructures it is one of the most important transport node in Europe with 4 airports 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different highspeed rail lines and hosts the second largest river port in Europe

To know whether or not the economics demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly proportionately in the current article I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History heritage and culture which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here  Ive counted words of each section including their paragraphs in introduction and in order to give a point of comparison Ive done the same about London which is a similar size capital city of a similar country

Its worth being mentionned though that Londons culture section is entirely dedicated to todays culture But even putting that aspect aside the London article which seems wellbalanced talk about as much of History heritage and culture than it does of economy demographics and transports In the case of Paris sections about the past aspects are 45 times bigger than those about todays aspect In reading this article we can decently believe that todays Paris is judged not relevant any
