Thank you for your helpful contribution 
Please excuse some editors who have either not yet read or have forgotten that the founder of Wikipedia himself wrote an article called ignore all rules It can sometimes be useful to check an editors talk page where one can sometimes put an editors actions in a context

Thank you for supplying the names of survivors which were difficult to find without having the names Once I had a clue where to look for references the task was pretty straight forward Other editors could have done it but prefer to delete unnecessarily one can first add a tag saying citation needed and then adding insult to injury leave notes around that are more apt to offend than help This is runs counter to Wikipedias goal of attracting and retaining new editors
