Ill find for you the decision on the official court site if thats hearting you so bad If same movie will be posted on the site of Polish Historic Museum this will be the reliable source but when it is on YouTube its not  Its kinda funny By the way according to WPRS Warsaw Voice news arent reliable source because the page is made by the random people who have some beliefes so they are not NPOV The title of the article is a hoax  Fighting Fascism in Poland we dont have fascists we have neonazis that is a first thing Second Third Position neoNazi organization  Third position cant be a neonazi because it is against left and right wing capitalism and socislism so The Warsaw Voice doesnt know what they are writing about contains a sentence stating that Jews will be removed from Poland and their possessions will be confiscated taken directly from Adolph Hitlers Mein Kampf  No references given from the official site or documents made by NOP as a reliable source from publishers of ideology I wonder why The Warsaw Voice lie every sentence and dont give any references for their imaginary text
