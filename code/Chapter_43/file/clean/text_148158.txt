Who copies who 

This 2007 edit brought the plot summary to a state almost identical to IMDBs synopsis here last edited 3 years ago which would be 2008 at the earliest The only difference is IMDB omits the mdashes around posing as a waiter In 2007 October 30 IMDB had no synopsis while wikipedia had this 2007 October 23 version This 2009 January IMDB version implies the last IMDB edit was around 2008 May or June The sole IMDB contributor appears to have created other synopses remarkably similar to or exact copies of those found on wikipedia for example this one for Ghost Dad and this one for Boarding Gate
