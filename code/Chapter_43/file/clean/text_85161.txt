See you on the talk page of the article BTW I gave reasons for the edits in the edit summary either you didnt read them or you didnt think they are valid If you dont think they are valid please explain it to me here on this talk page Also I thought Id respectfully point out to you your absence in applying this policy to PICOs edits when he unilaterally removed 60000 characters from a wiki and that I find this action quite hypocritical on your part
