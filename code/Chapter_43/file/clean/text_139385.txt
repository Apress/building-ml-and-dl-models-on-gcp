 Episode naming 

Hi Cyberia  Theres actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at WikipediaNaming conventions television and its talk page  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when its necessary  that is when theres no other article by that name  This is why for example Tigh Me Up Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up Tigh Me Down Battlestar Galactica  there is no other article that could be at that page  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WPD specifically WPDDeciding to disambiguate which says
Ask yourself When a reader enters this term and pushes Go what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result For example when someone looks up Joker would they find information on a comedian On a card On Batmans nemesis On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band When there is no risk of confusion do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page
The argument you give that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify has been considered in the debate at WTTVNC but most editors felt that the consistency was a misleading virtue since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic

The Star Trek precedent is in my opinion a bad one the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WTTVNC and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon

I admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship with a capital S and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship with no capitals its sufficiently clear  However if you and other BSG editors feel that its better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page with the episode at Resurrection Ship Battlestar Galactica episode and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship that would be OK too  talk  contribs 

Its been considered  See the extensive discussion at WTTVNC and its archives especially here Basically the argument is that disambiguation isnt about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name  So its appropriate for The Enemy Within to be disambiguated The Enemy Within TOS episode since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within disambiguation  But theres no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated since only the TOS episode has that name  talk  contribs
