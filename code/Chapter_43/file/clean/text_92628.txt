Character infoboxes 

The infoboxes on this article are now pointless without any images we might as well rm all the infoboxes on this article and use family sections for each character the infobox inormation is already in the characters section anyway except the family so i believe they should be removed UserNotdoppler 28 August 2008 UTC
