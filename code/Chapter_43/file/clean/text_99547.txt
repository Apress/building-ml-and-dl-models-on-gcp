 Activity in Wikiproject Aquarium fish has slowed to a crawl it seems We still have a few dedicated editors plus a few new faces Any participation is appreciated however we really cant tackle big projects with this level of activity Give us a shout if you want to become active again
 We are now ready to restart the awards program but no one has done it yet If you are up for the challenge please come forward
