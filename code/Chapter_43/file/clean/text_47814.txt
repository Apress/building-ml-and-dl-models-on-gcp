 Your questionable post 

Dear Anonymiss Madchen I am still waiting you to retract this your edit
How would the 200000 Germans killed in concentration camps by Nazis for being Jewish feel about the Russian genocide

While it may be acceptable to equate a barbarous political organisation with animals it is quite unacceptable to do the same in the case of a whole nation In my opinion it is quite necessary to remove this statement as well as other statements of that type otherwise sanctions against you may followRegards   
Thanks  

Sadly but I have to return to this issue again You placed the quote from the primary source that is a direct insult of the whole nation  I would like you to explain what idea did you want to convey by that If you really share the idea that the Russian has no regard for human life and they are all out sonsofbitches barbarians and chronic drunks and you really want that idea to be implemented in the article you probably should not edit Wikipedia That is my last warning  
PS Taking into account that the full Pattons quote The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European but an Asiatic and therefore thinks deviously We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinese or a Japanese and from what I have seen of them I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them In addition to his other amiable characteristics the Russian has no regard for human life and they are all out sonsofbitches barbarians and chronic drunks has such a profound idea that good Russian is a dead Russian I see absolutely no use in this quote for the Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany talk page You either remove this post completely or I report you  
PPS I also expect you to immediately remove all racist crap from your user page  You have one day for that  
Thank you Anonymiss Madchen Do not forget to read the play  and importantly please watch the film
Cheers  

 Genocide denial 

By selfreverting this your post  you did a right thing that was a legal threat so you could be blocked indefinitely for that Of course I myself would ton report you I hate this type things and I try to avoid that however any other user who monitor my talk page could do thatRegarding the essence of the post you deleted I concede I had to make myself more clear Rummel worked during the times when no reliable information were available for the USSR and other Communist countries He elaborated his own approach to estimate the number of victims and this approach has been criticised by other scholars in general see eg Barbara Ha
