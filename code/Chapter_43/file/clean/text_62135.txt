If you see the civil list of CSS cadre officer of Grade A then you will see candidates are holding position all the way from Under Secretary to Deputy Secretary both junior and senior to Directors to Joint Secretary and even to few Additional Secretaries 

This means that CSS group A cadre officers are holding positions from low to mid to high level executive posts in the Central Government It is just wrong to say that they hold only lower and middle level positions in the Government As per history the CSS was devised primarily to manage the middle level posts in the Central Secretariat which is the Headquarters of the Union Government but if you see the Civil list it can be clearly seen that since independence CSS has evolved and grown Hence the Group A officer also holds posts as Joint and Additional Secretary position which is not a middle level but a SAG level position

Group A and Group B
CSS officers belong to group A who are direct recruits and the ones who belong to Group B who are recruits through non civil service exam You should know that both Group A and Group B officer belong to both Central Civil Services of the Government of India
