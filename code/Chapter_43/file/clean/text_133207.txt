OK  you just intimated that I called him a Nazi  You didnt actually say that  I said originally that the DM published a piece that reckoned Arbeit Macht Frei was appropriate under some circumstances eg in modernBritain for people without work and I think I gave a referencedate  I hate that paper  yes hate  It supported Nazis before the war and papers like that in Germany on the conservative reactionary right helped Hitler to power  My depth of loathing is based on close knowledge of what happened in Germany to all sorts of people and my Jewish East End roots  It is still reactionary  its not a normal paper that just leans to the right and it pumps out nasty bile that Id like people to see for what it is  BUT I set about it the wrong way  I was a bit childish in posting the comment on Cs page  That said have a look through his history like you have had a butchers at mine and you will see that hes sucked loads of people into arguments and blocking threats and counterthreats and controversy Best
