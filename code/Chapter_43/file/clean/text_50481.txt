TNA PayPerViews 
Sorry to bother you again but I have a proposal for the TNA payperviews so they look more like the WWE PayPerView articles WWE PayPerView articles for instance have all the WWE No Way Outs together and all the WWE Vengeances together so is there any way you could put all the TNA PPVs into one

EG
TNA Final Resolutions all in one article
TNA Genesis in a seperate article

If this occurs with all PayPerViews it would look more like the traditional way like what it is like for WWE ECW  WCW PPVs

Many thanks
