1 Thanks for not speedy deleting the category like I was afraid would happen 2 I will remember to use the edit summaries but I dont think theyre really important seeing how I have citation to back me up and 3 I removed the Disney People category from the Disney Legends because its appropriate for the Disney Legends category to be under the Disney People category and I felt itd be innapropriate for someone to be listed under the major category and a subcategory but correct me if Im wrong and Ill apologise
