Second opinion by Ericleb01

Im following up on Cannibalokis review I completed an entire copyedit of the article but Im going to have to fail this mainly because it doesnt cover enough material The Bostaphs departure section does not belong in this article as while it does mention the DVD his leave from the band has nothing to do with it With that gone I would recommend you look at other example concert video GAs such as Number Ones video and Celebration The Video Collection as well as WPALBUMArticle body for some ideas Also use a bit less quotations as it disrupts the flow when reading This is really close to passing in my book however so dont give this up EricLeb01   Talk
