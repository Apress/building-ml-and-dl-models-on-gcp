Hi I dont really care much for the SerbAlbanian disputes but I thought it was common knowledge that Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia at least theoretically The way it is written it makes it sound that Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia I am pretty sure this is not the case otherwise its position under international law would be similar to that of Montenegro and independence would be much less of a problem than it is at this point The article should be unprotected and reference to Serbia should be included I dont think Albanian wikipedians should try to stop this from happening The problem and paradox of Kosovo still being part of Serbia is not going to go away by negating it on wikipedia If I were Kosovar Albanian i would be trying to make this be known so as to find a solution for the future of my territory
