Just to let you know I removed the tag from the Edward Mannock article The article does state he became a member of the Labour party but many tens of thousands of others have over the years No biggy of course and I can see why a bot might flag that I really dont know or care to know how these bots work but maybe if there is just one mention of a political party it should maybe flag it as a possible for human checking rather than adding the cat straight off  
Thanks for pointing that one out The bot is tagging articles based on a set of categories related to UK Politics The Edward Mannock article is included in CategoryLabour Party politicians UK If he was a politician then he is in the scope of UK politics If he wasnt a politician then the category probably needs to be removed from the article
He may be better off in CategoryLabour Party people UK which has been selected for manual checking as not all Labour party people are directly involved with politics Regards   

Same goes for Leslie Scarman Baron Scarman  a judge and barrister not a politician    
This is occuring because of CategoryLaw lords xenotalk 1838
