More nonsense  Your rationalization might have some merit had I simply restored the list in the form that it was previously  But the objections to the list that it was baseless racist and uncited  the latter not being a requirement for article talk pages  Still I took the time to add citationssources for a good deal of that information included in the list leaving the most obvious additions uncited because they are fairly common knowledge as stereotypes  Neither you nor your counterpart has offered any plausible explanation or justification for why the list should be expunged or why the editor who deleted it was justified in doing so x
