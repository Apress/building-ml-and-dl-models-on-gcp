I see no mention of the amount of money that was fleeced from the public  I remember it was in the millions and I think it was in the tens of millions that they took in as I recall they employed a couple of hundred people in their boilerroom operation in Florida I think it was  Also as I vaguely recall they spirited millions of dollars out of the United States into Carribbean banks when they realised the net was closing in but there is no mention of any of this in the article  Can somebody that knows this stuff put it in  Otherwise its pretty onesided  I mean if they fleeced tens of millions then a sentence of 18 years seems about right  Thansk in advance
