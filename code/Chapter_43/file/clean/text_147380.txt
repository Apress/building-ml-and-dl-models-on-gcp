Um what please 

What You call me a troll because I vocally criticise a Wikipedia policy that I very deeply consider flawed and harmful to the project I feel very much insulted right now I dont do this to get attention or whatever the current definition of a troll is This very policy that I am talking about has been invoked again and again and again in the most ridiculous cases against  in my opinion  completely legitimate and worthy edits And I must say  while a lot of negative things could be said about the individuals that invoked the policy in those cases ultimately they are right The policy formulation does not leave room for any interpretation In many ways Ahem

Therefore also for being of a smartass I must reject your request and ask you to stay away from my user talk page for a bit You wont change my opinion about the policy or my decision to lobby to have it removed I dont like to have cluttered up talk pages either  itd be so much easier if people just listened to me instead of arguing all the time But thats just not happening sadly
