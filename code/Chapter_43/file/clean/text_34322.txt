Hmmm am I a reincarnation of Gidonb Here and here your name is recently mentioned I think I am fighting now a lost battle but it tells a lot that after you left the Dutch Wikipedia a couple of years ago your spirit is still alive  I agree with your analyses above Although for almost over a year he didnt change the article just recently adding his pov which prompted me to correct it and start a discussion So my opinion you never know what impact your edits can have 
Hmmm on a more positive note then I think I am following again in your footsteps since I have changed nlPortaalJodendom portal after years of neglect Unfortunately zero feedback I personally think its an improvement but since it was almost unchanged since you started it I thought you might appreciate it that I actually did something with the portal
I also started yiddish acticles like nlHoteldebotel nlKoefnoen uitdrukking nlTacheles nlGannef and I have created and am working on nlCategorieJiddisch by adding new articles and I am planning on starting a portal as well As for other jewish topics I find it hard that like nlSjabbatkaarsen nlJitschak Abarbanel nlIsraÃ«l in de Davis Cup or nlJiddisch van A tot Z and many others there is no input from others whatsoever Maybe thats the key difference with the English Wikipedia there are many more people here that are contributing on these topics I hope to become more active here as well probabely in a month orso Kol tuv
