I would be surprised since she told me that she put it here  I suppose it could be possible  I made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site  It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikkis personal experiences and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles but at some time or another have been naturists  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity nudismnaturists and pedophilia  Her words are strong and certainly her POV  There is no backing with any research to support her point  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction  At any rate the reason we have guidelines such as WikipediaExternal_linksLinks_normally_to_be_avoided is to give us guidance in such instances  Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research seems pretty clear to me regardless as to whether Ms Craft was the original person who placed it here or not   

It appears that the link was introduced by userDandelion1 here
