final thoughts on this matter 

My view is that Mark and you do not do malicious things to the article  If everyone where like you and mark who disagreed with me there would be no problem here  Any conflict of ideas could be worked out This has not been the case though  I know this page like it or not has been like a creationism page with harrassment and other unsavory tactics being employed  I would be foolish not to recognize this given what I have experienced 

Now I dont think the antiBSF people who are not like you and Mark are likely going to change or dont need to change  You may think so  You may think they can be worked with  I think if they could be worked with they would have to be held more accountable for their actions and this is likely not going to happen given the amount of silence that is occuring   The creationism article tells me that Wikipedia is not very interested in protecting minority view articles anyways
