Sudhir I too sometimes wish that wikipedia pages could be frozen in the versions that I like but alas wikipedia rules and ethos stand in the way 
More seriously I assume you are referring to this version of the page that was last edited by you I havent read that version completely but the Early Life section in it was largely sourced to
 Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya By Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya Dhusar Bhargava Memorial Charitable Trust Regd Rekmo Press New Delhi I havent seen this work but the listed author suggests that it is a community history which for the same reason as ML Bhargavas book is deprecated on wikipedia
 Anokha Aarohi by Kranti Trivedi This is a work of fiction  
Please take a look at WPHISTRS for why we prefer academic histories and modern scholarly works in writing wikipedia articles That is not going to change anytime soon and I dont want to give you false hope that the Early life section can be edited to resemble the version it was on Sep 22 last year
