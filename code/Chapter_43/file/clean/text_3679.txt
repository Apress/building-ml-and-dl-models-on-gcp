xkcd

Hey  A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me Randall Munroe labeling it patently madeup information  Understandable and taken in good humor of course and nothing on the page is sourced its more of a stub than anything  But Im curious why you were so sure it was fabricated    xkcd
I find it hard to believe that a 22yearold could have been working fulltime for NASA Of course you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe   Schreit mich an 
I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects  Its not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets

Anyway the information is taken from my published bio page but youre right  you have no way of knowing whether Im lying or not  I guess its probably safest to assume that I am
In that case Ill admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place I know very little about science but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area Feel free to readd the info although the impression I got from the original version was more than you werent just a contract worker If thats not even a valid distinction in the States  its increasingly less of one here in Oz  then my apologies there in advance   Schreit mich an 
 Honestly they never really explained to me which one I was  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots and NASA paid me through a government contractor  When I said I work for NASA no one argued

 It was a lot more Dilbertesque than you would expect  Old echoing tile hallways with quiet gruff middleaged men working at blueprintcovered desks mild office politics lots of presentations and buzzwords and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way  I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work and it was good in a lot of ways but I was happy to leave  xkcd

 Can you nominate my entry 

Hey BigHaz can you please show me how the nomination process goes for DYK I mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated Actually this thing is new to me Thanks  
Sure thing The way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook That gets put onto the Suggestions page which Ill move it to in a moment Over the next few days people will make various comments about it  if the hook is too long if it needs sources whatever else If youre able to respond to those comments if there are any made then your article might get selected   Schreit mich an 
 By suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what  
  
Its not easy to do that since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page so I really cant just point you to a page and say here you are What particularly do you want to see If youre after examples of the kinds of comments people make just keep an eye on the Suggestions page   Schreit mich an 

Caucasian ethnicities
semites are caucasian  
Or indeed not See for example Semitic which clearly indicates otherwise They speak wildly different languages to those spoken by IndoEuropean people who are the ones we normally call Caucasian so unless theres some startling new research out there I dont think that comment is accurate   Schreit mich an 
Im not even going to dignify this with a response Use
