Oh I completely agree I have kept to editing these concepts to a minimum for this Ontology is to be or on to and this is in Greek by categorization Ontology and metaphysics by proxy are nothing more then to categorize something If you get a chance to look at the Bradshaw link to his book notice that he uses the Greek words in Greek with Greek fonts This is because the meaning to the words have been so drastically changed that for people to say them now in some cases means that the original lessons and knowledge epistemology has been lost Hopefully the categorization example I gave shows some flexibility but it is also safe to say by the book that no one translates entelechy as intelligibility For this UserAndrew Lancaster is correct
