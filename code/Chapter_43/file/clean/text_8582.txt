Hm sounds nice what is it  Sorry not an expert here I just go by what the author himself wrote in the abstract You know the part written in laymen terms so that everyone who reads English can get it Please note where the author says Fourier but does not say least squares when describing what his paper is all about You should be able to get it really it is a rather brief and sole statement Or did you still not get it that Fourier analysis and LSSA are two different things Your contradictions with authors abstract are out of course Bfigura can you read English Please read the abstract too Thanks guys for trying too hard
