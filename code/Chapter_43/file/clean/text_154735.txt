Sorry but Newton did not have Aspergers syndrome I friend of mine work as a psychiatrist She claimed that doctors often say to patients with Aspergers that Einstein or some other brilliant scientist had the condition because it gives them a sense of hope a sense of pride many people with Aspergers are often depressed and sometimes even suicidal If you can prevent them from committing suicide it will save the doctors alot of paper work and help advance their careers Genius creativity and excentricity has absolutely no business associating with autism

Autism is simply a disorder that makes it very hard if not impossible for a person with the condition to interact with other people Since their is no link between high intelligence and autism the overwhelming majority of people with Aspergers have average IQ
