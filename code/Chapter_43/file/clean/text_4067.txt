I have no desire to edit anything those who put up nonsense should be the ones removing it  The reality is as it stands irreligion is associated ONLY with Christianity  This is a SERIOUS POV issue and those who put the portal link need to address this question  It does NOT logically follow that one group of Christians views should lead to this portal link being placed in the talk page to the exclusion of all other religions  It is frankly speaking an attempt to frame the article in a manner that targets one religion and that is not acceptable at all
