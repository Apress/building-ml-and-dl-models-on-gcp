Your question was why not restore the information because the same users delete it and that constitues an edit war  The original version of the article was restored after the vandalism per cameron1s instructions and within 12 hours the same users went back and gutted the information out  Cluebot caught it and reverted the changes  It seems they are gutting a little at a time so as not to alert cluebot  Since an edit war is a violation of wiki policies the only other option is to mark the article with the wiki tags658718573
