Infobox statehood 

I dont understand The infobox says that the first states were formed around 3000 BC while the last independent state was abolished in 1461 Runcimans The Fall of Constantinople is provided as a reference Thats fine but did a state called Greece or Ellada or Hellas or Ellas really existed in the antiquity andor during the middle ages The term Ancient Greece doesnt refer to a particular state like the Roman Empire or Roman Republic but it refers to a historical period There were several citystates like Athens Sparta and so on and later in the middle ages there was the Byzantine Empire and its succesors such as the Despotate of Morea and so on None of those souvereign entities was called Greece nor Hellas Ellas etc Of course all of them play an important part in the Greek history and culture so the Greek people claim them as their own however its the statehood continuity we are talking about here The modern Greek state was created in 1825 and thats the only real beginning of the story before that territory was Ottoman Turkey before that Byzantine Empire before that Roman Empire before that and so on There was no state called Greece
