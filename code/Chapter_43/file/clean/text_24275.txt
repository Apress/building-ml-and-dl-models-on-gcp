Re the railroad trestle there are several photos of the Euclid trestle but they are not in any published work of which Im aware  It is also included on an early Sanborn map which is accessible online from some public libraries  I believe the ref to the trestle on Henry Street is the Gazette probably about the time of the construction of the Northbrae Tunnel but the date of the article is not handy to me right now
