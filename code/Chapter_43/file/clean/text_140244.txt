Katr67 I apologize if that came across as uncivil  I meant it more towards Wikipedia in general than to you personally  Were all volunteers on here  I just see so much information on here thats unsourced and so I found it a little ironic that something as apparently minor as this guys involvement in a youth organization was insisted upon being sourced  But this does follow Wikipedias guidelines and will respect such efforts in the future
