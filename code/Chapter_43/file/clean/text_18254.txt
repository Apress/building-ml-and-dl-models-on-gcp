I just tagged the ones you marked  However before we take this to a more public review I would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay  No point in wasting other editors time if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere and thats generally not allowed  There are some specific exceptions but I dont see them applying  You should read the Copyright FAQ specifically section 11 and 4  If you took something from somewhere and modified it it would count as a derivative work  The copyright for the original still applies in that case so it will not be allowed to remain here

 As for using pictures created by your father I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission I think there is a more formal way to register the permission but I wouldnt bother  You should know though that the license tag you selected public domain allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it  Essentially youre releasing the copyright  Thats good for Wikipedia but if you think the picture is of great quality you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses which are still accepted on Wikipedia  If this is something you want to do Ill be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs

 In short it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work  Even with a link back to the source you cant just take the image and use it here  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of nonfree materials such as fair use section 5 in the FAQ but then it would require retagging and a detailed fair use rationale  It doesnt look like any of the remaining images cant conceivably be replaced by free alternatives and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles theyre used in  Hence youll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted
