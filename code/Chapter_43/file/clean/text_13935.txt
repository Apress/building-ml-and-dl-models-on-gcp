A child born to a Portuguese parent is automatically a Portuguese citizen provided the parent was born in Portugal Portuguese nationality law Which part did you not understand She did not only  apply for citizenship she only regularized her papers She could have done it at age 90 She would be Portuguese all the way In Canada you have  one month to register a child in Portugal for those born abroad there is no time limit to register 

I will give you an easy example  I child born in Canada before being registered is not Canadian So  all the children that are born in Canada and die before being registered are foreighners
  
The problem I have with the consensus version
1 It is not a consensus not everybody agrees
2 You were given references
3 Citizenship as you are awareit is not the same as nationality And writing she is Canadian with Portuguese nationality would be misleading too  
4 She is no more Canadian than she is Portuguese
5 I can only understand your reasons as being xenophobicIf you have any valid reason please state it
