I disagree  The article and its references state that the town not simply a trading post was bought and renamed Unless you have reliable sources to state otherwise the town name stays as is  I will grant you that most locals likely still know the town as Buford and refer to it as such  I doubt any real confusion would be caused amongst postal customers and other businesses as the lede mentions prominently that the town used to be called Buford
On a separate note please sign your comments by using four tildes at the end of your comments and use the edit summary when you edit  Wikipedia has been around for more than a decade and we have developed a lot of rules for how stuff is done  It will take some getting used to  talk
