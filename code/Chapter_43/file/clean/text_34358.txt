No one says to toss the New York Times I explicitly acknowledged in my above post that there are sources that name Rand a philosopher  However there are many other sources that do not give her that designation  Simply calling her a philosopher would ignore the multitude of sources that do not call her as such  As far as the articles that you are citing for precedent none of them are featured articles  When we look at other Wikipedia articles we only look at the ones that have reached Featured Article status  These are articles that meet certain criteria of excellence  We can look at other articles for ideas but they are by no means precedential as they lack one or more of the criteria that make for an excellent article
