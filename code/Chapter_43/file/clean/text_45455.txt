Blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse

Race and intelligence explanationsSpearmans hypothesis

IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents The mean BlackWhite difference varies considerably across tests with different contents For example the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order Across a large number of test the standardized mean BlackWhite gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation According to  this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean WB difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests

The gbased factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities Correlations between an IQ subtests gloading and the magnitude of the BlackWhiteEast Asian score gap for that subtest   pp 478  pp 1389  For example the BlackWhite gap is greater on backward digits span a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given and the more gloaded test than forward digits span a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given and the less gloaded test  As predicted by Spearmans hypothesis the BW gap is largest on the most gloaded tests  Narrowing of the BW gap has been seen mostly on less gloaded tests such as literacy tests Murray C  2005 The Inequality Taboo  Commentary Magazine September 2005 Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the BlackWhite gap for example past history of slavery discrimination caste status peer pressure against acting white etc have an effect on g  p 510
The author of multiple factor analysis L L Thurstone 1947 warned we must guard against the simple but common error of merely taking a first centroid factor a first principal component or other mean factor in a test battery and then calling it a general factor  Spearmans g then is a statistical artifact C Loring Brace 2001

The gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence

a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given and the more gloaded test

IQ tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence

This is obviously original research but I cannot find no sources that supports my argument even though I am not black
