Addiction is a choice made by the user

This can make freebase drugs even more powerfully addictive than their salt equivalents bearing in mind that addiction is a choice made by the user

That addiction is a choice made by the user rather than a dependency caused by alterations in the brains chemistry is clearly an unorthodox view to say the least so I propose removing it ASAP 

 I vote it be removed under NPOV  Oh wait  This whole point and counter point are totally offtopic they belongs in eg addiction  

 Selfreferencing 

The link to Freebasing refers back to the page but I dont know how to fix that so I ask someone who know to do so
