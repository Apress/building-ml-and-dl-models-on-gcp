etymology
I can not edit the main page so i will put it here so that some admin can insert it in the article Eliphant is derived from sanskrit word hantis meaning elephant literally meaning having large hands The Arabs took this word and put El the before it and it passed into Italian as elephanti and from there on made its way into other European languages  

Do you just know this or do you have references to support it References would be better
