I dont aim to debate or complain Deskana and I have no especial interest in the outcome of this RfA beyond having voted to support However I would like help understanding your rationale Why is it kosher to count neutral votes as opposes Perhaps I misunderstand the point of a neutral vote but it seems to me you have chosen to count a nominally neutral voters comments as a de facto oppose vote Wouldnt those who voted neutral ie no opinion one way or the other have voted to oppose if thats what theyd intended This strikes me as being tantamount to co√∂pting votes and given that the difference between discarding the neutrals and counting them as opposes is the difference between 68 and 75 support I would like to better understand this aspect of the consensus doctrine Thanks in advance
