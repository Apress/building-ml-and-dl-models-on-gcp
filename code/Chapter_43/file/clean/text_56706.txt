The thing is it doesnt actually help RK win his arguments it just makes him look silly and full of bluster Wikipedia doesnt and shouldnt operate on official censure and doesnt and shouldnt operate on appeals to authority ie senior Wikipedians RK can be talked down Ive seen many people do it before and the result is often vastly superior articles because people take the time to read first sources in order to counter his bluster So I would suggest learning to talk things out rather than running to the cops If you dont think you can deal with RK right now work on something else until youre up for it  the Wikipedia is vast  1638 13 Aug 2003 UTC
