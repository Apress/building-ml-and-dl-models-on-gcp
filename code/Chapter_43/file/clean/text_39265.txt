Saccade
Hello I was just wondering why my submission for saccade was refused The bands music has been featured on TV They have been reviewed in established Irish music publications like the Irish Times and Hot Press and have been featured on the TG4 show Deis Roc All the information is cited so even if the article was submitted as a stub that would be great Please give me any more information if theres something I should change to help it be accepted
