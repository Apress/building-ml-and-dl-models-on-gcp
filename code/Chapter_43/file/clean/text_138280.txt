Ah sorry my mistake you do not write MIDFIELDER ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL but MIDFIELDER FOOTBALL But if you look well you will see at the top of the MIDFIELDER article if you write MIDFIELDER FOOTBALL these words written Redirected from MIDFIELDER FOOTBALL because the articles name is just MIDFIELDER Redirects are not good in Wikipedia

Please in the future when writing about player positions write GOALKEEPER ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL DEFENDER ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL FORWARD ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL and MIDFIELDER nothing in parenthesis please Thank you for listening continue the good work  217129655
