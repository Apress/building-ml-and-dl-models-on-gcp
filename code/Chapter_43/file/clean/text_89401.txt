Numbers 185 Numbers 1820 Deuteronomy 109 Deuteronomy 181 God promised Aaron and his decendents several honourable duties and inheritances 
 
An everlasting priesthood throughout their generations  
I have given the Levites  They are given to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the children of Israel  
The LORD said unto Aaron Thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood  
Ye shall keep the charge of the holy things and the charge of the altar that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel  
Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any portion among them I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel  
Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren the LORD is his inheritance  
The priests the Levites even all the tribe of Levi shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire and His inheritance and they shall have no inheritance among their brethren the LORD is their inheritance
