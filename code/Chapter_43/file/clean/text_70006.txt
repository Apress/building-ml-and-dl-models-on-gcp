Hmm Id read the stuff at Luftwaffe but hadnt seen the History discussion wow an admin protected the article because of your editing So that reinforces what Ive been saying about moving slowly so that everyone involved has a chance to read up and comment Dont worry about the incoming links until you have solidified the actual article split and gotten agreement that you are doing it right My specific suggestion though is that you should post over at WTMILHIST talk requesting scrutiny of your work plan for this article They will be able to check up on the content part of your split and they know the procedures too whereas all I can do is monitor attribution The more people you get involved the better even if some of them object to some stuff  or actually because some of them will object like I did over the attribution issue
