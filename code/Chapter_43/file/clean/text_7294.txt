Note 

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6 and Hamas retaliated with rockets I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN However it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israels deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died though Israel denied any involvementThe Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted terror sites and concealed rocket launchers in the enclave but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah on the Egyptian border where the Hamas gunmen died Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later they apparently set off explosives thereHamas blamed Israel escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation Hamas claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically
