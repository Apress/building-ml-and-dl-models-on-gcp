Thanks 

Thanks Ten I wasnt the target of those rather scathing comments but as a new admin I was offended I went through CSD yesterday and left quite a few articles because I was unsure the ones I deleted I felt like were valid CSD For an experienced admin to berate a new admin MTG got his powers this morning for Christs sake is just inexcusable I understand very well why so many people leave the project The attacks come from the vandals and the people who are supposed to back you up Thanks for being one of the people who is slow to criticize and quick to praise I knew you were a good egg when I voted for you         Talk 2036 July 22 2005 UTC
