Please would you stop changing the article which appears to be about yourself in the manner im which you are doing Wikipedia has very clear guidelines about how articles should be constructed and whilst you are clearly trying to improve the article unfortunately you are doing exactly the opposite and you are removing valid formatting and content You should not for example remove the bolding of your name nor the references I am more than happy to help you improve the article but would ask you not to revert the article again in the same format I will work on it now to add the content you are adding but in the correct format Thank youTalk
