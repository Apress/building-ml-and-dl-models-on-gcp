Some notes after the revamp

Strabo is the main source I think Ive read him but also Pliny and confuse what belongs to each one Plus all the secondary references

Vascon is the Lat singular for Vascones But I strongly favor the move to Vascones after all they are an ethnic group hence a plurality and also it is consistent with other related entries as Aquitani Varduli Caristii Autrigones and Cantabri

The information on Middle Ages Vasconia is now in Duchy of Vasconia
