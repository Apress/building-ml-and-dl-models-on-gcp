Debut for Yorkshire 

I would like to get some feedback before I post this picture to the article  It looks like the cricketer sitting in the center of the front row is Kilner  Even if Kilner is not pictured in the photo it seems to me that the picture is relevant to the Debut for Yorkshire section of the article  The article is somewhat lacking in good pictures anyway so adding this might enhance it to some degree
