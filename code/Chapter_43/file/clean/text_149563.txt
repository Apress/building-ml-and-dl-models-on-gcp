Rules
Hi  I know youre new and cant be expected to know much yet  But theres a key rule that you should know about WP3RR which says that you cant perform more than 3 reverts in 24 hours  Deletion of entire paragraphs is commonly considered a revert so I suggest you slow down and use the talk page more instead of continued deletions  Ill also leave a plate of links below so that you can get to know this place better
