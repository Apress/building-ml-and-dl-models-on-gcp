Hey Sue How are u from u know who

Hey Sue Anne how are you

Hope you are as fine as always

Looks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my IP userpage LOL

Some of the cabal must have jumped in looking at the edit history maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways LOL I feel bad for them they must have been nursing their grudges for long LOL

Your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal LOL
Would you be bothered enough to put it in place again
The cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way HAHAHAHAHA

I did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabals unmentionable things LOL I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh

A few things did come out of the incident

Crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me
He further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied and that he had no idea about the issue but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message LOL Even after warning me and sending me another message he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all LOL
He further did not even warn Vesther but he warned me for using those words Vesthers words which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine LOL

So the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin Who makes these guys admins LOL

As for Mr Royboy LOL The less said about him the better LOL HAHAHAHAHA
Who made this guy admin Where did he come from Who IS he
What explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME
Me and Crossmr were just talking about his warning which u know by now was totally wrong and biased he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala which Vesther had used and this guy turns up from nowhere
It was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges Too bad I foiled it
I guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue I sympathize with his condition

Some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess Vesther being a case in point
Is it possible that this guys a friend or a sockpuppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member LOL

Anyway the above two examples are on record and you are the witness 
And I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues I mean unblocking

I guess this petty cabal must have been going about this just block without any warning to block and without understanding or reading anything about it with other people before they came across someone like me LOL And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that as excuses They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on LOL

I sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock seeing how u understood the issue and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block

No reading no understanding of the specific issue no warning to the original guilty party no warning to block just block LOL

But Now they will think hard before going on about their murky ways
LOL

So by extrapolating this I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence LOL

All the more reason its needs me LOL

I wont let you down wiki LOL

Of course there must be many good decent admins like you

A few words about my messages I had sent

With regard to Vesther we both know what I feel about him HAHAHAHAHA LOL
But to be fair its not his fault really Its the incompetent powermad admins fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties LOL

Vesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back giving him some of his own medicine he just started crying LOL I guess hes not used to it Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him LOL Too bad I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

And he has further archived the discussions Hmmmmm Not a bad idea when do u think I should archive that nowuseless page as it is
