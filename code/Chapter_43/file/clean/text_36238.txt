Speedy deletion of Over Nine Thousand 

Hi I recently proposed the speed deletion of the Over Nine Thousand under the G4 criterion as a page which has already been deleted as a result of a consensus and later recreated with mostly identical content Could you explain why this redirect does not meet these specifications I noted that this redirect was deleted as a result of RfD process and the discussion can be found here Thanks in advance for any explanation and I apologise if I have overlooked something  TALK
