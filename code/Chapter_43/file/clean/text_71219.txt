Interesting picture it really makes me not wanting to visit that website at all so if the creator of this picture intended to advertise that website then she or he has failed miserably I dont think the website or the person depicted are notable in any way theyll probably be forgotten in history  Wikipedia is such a wonderful world its a shame some people want to exploit it for their mememeandonlymeandmymoney goals dont you think Why cant everyone understand that humanity needs a neutral and factually correct encyclopedia for helping our childrens education and not another one place to advertise or promote ones interests
