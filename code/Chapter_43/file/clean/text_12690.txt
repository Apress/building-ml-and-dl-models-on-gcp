Helping me to make my first wikipedia edit

Hello I tried to add VERIFIABLE source content to benevolent dictator using google books and the name Barack Obama but you seem to keep removing it

If you could assist me in adding the name Barack Obama and showing me how to add the reference I would like that very much as this is my first time trying to do a proper wiki edit

Here is the book link httpsbooksgooglecombooksid6oaGB7w_yX8CpgPA26lpgPA26dqbarackobamabenevolentdictatorsourceblotsj_oSQiBlv1sigLi1hjbmilefFMXUzmCc73eYWS_UhlensaXeiEk7eVPX7Fc2VyASe_YKgCQved0CE8Q6AEwCQvonepageqbarack20obama20benevolent20dictatorffalse

and the name Barack Obama should go in the first or last position of examples of names given for benevolent dictators

thanks
