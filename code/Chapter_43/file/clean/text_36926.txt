Hi Toa Nidhiki05 I saw that Its ironic that one of the reasons given for blocking me was my suggestion of bad faith on the part of the leftwingers in the Libertarianism talk page when they demonstrate blatant bad faith at every turn  one of them is a pathological liar who cannot be reasoned with on any level another is an obsessed stalker who went on a 24 hour Wikipaedia marathon to hound my every move until I was blocked and the other one is just plain batty
I showed the Libertarianism page to some members of New Zealands Libertarianz Party and they barely recognised that it was even about Libertarianism They thought it was an Anarchism page where someone at changed the word Anarchism to Libertarian Not only is socalled rightLibertarianism not given the predominance in the page that is so clearly appropriate but it barely receives enough recognition to be noticeable among all the talk about AnarchisminLibertarianclothing Its pretty frustrating that such blatant sabotage of the Libertarianism page is not only permitted but protected by the powersthatbe
