But Poliakovs views havent He has said a lot of postiive things about Muhammad eg that Muhammad was very resepectful towrds the Jews Infact I have yet to verify the source in which Poliakov accuses Islam of antisemitism In anycase Bernard Lewis is an exceptional scholar because he is a scholar both on Islamic history and antisemtism Mark Cohen is also a scholar on Jews under Islam Most of the rest of the scholars quoted are either scholars on Islam or antisemitism
