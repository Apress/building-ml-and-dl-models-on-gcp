Hello
Before I begin another discussion I would like first of all to apologize for what I did letting circumstantial evidence slip like that like I was disrupting Even if I was I shouldnt have talked back to you or the other user It didnt matter who was right I should still have conformed to the rules

Now another question can BBC count as a reliable source Obviously Fox News cannot even count as news because of the extreme subjectivities but BBC supposedly has a tiny bit of it
