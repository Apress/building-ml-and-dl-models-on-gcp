If I never questioned the statement that E3b is common in Europe to begin with although I did say the word was vague it would indeed be odd if I then went on to say that the statement is extreme How could something be vague be extreme I also to say it once more do not question that the referenced source about Pakistan might indeed have said that E3b is common in Europe though referring to what we can also read in articles about more specifically about Europe So I am questioning the type of referencing in the Wikipedia of which this is a discussion page which seems extreme Nothing else Please address that I have also explained specifically why I think this Please read what I wrote again and respond to what I really wrote The way I understand it an article on Pakistan is being used simply in order to justify the word common whereas the articles about Europe which both the Wikipedia article and the Pakistan E3b article must refer to perhaps do not use that exact word but rather give more detailed and less vague numbers and comments If this is so then maybe that is the way we should go  less vague
