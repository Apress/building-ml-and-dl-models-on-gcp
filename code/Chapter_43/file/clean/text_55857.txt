 Joseph Szigeti 

Hi there Would you mind taking a look at the Szigeti article and giving me some feedback I put it up for peer review a few days ago and all it got was a review generated by a bot The only comment that I found useful was that I can sometimes be too wordy there are apparently still redundancies and peacock termsbut I cant see any of that stuff in my own writing right now I need someone with fresh eyes to look at it Im hoping to put it up on WPFAC as soon as possible but I also dont want to nominate it before its ready Thanks talk 

Looks good its thorough and reads well  As is my nature rather than listing a lot of nitpicks like they do at the Featured Article Pillory Good Article Gauntlet and AClass Inquisition I uncapped my nitpicker and picked the few nits I found  Optionally you could expand the reception section theres lots of commentary on  Szigetis playing and contrasts with his contemporaries  oh you know everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting  none of that is necessary though its just something I might do if I were writing it  I wondered about separating out the family life section from the main biography since you cover the bureaucratic entanglements part twice but in different levels of detail but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it so  maybe fine as is  Good article   talk 

Oh one other minor thing  I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns such as   I hope I didnt inadvertently bork your paragraphing since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window  I assumed the lines were meant to be together  talk 

Thanks for the nitpicking it was exactly what I wanted you to do  Ive had the same thoughts about the Reception section just not really the time to go paw through the stacks to find interesting little tidbits Any ideas on what books would be most useful in that regard
I meant to take out the nowredundant part about bureaucratic entanglements must have just slipped my mind Completely mortified that I got the poor mans date of death wrong this whole time btw talk

Hi Antandrus Sometimes tells me you could use a little distraction from Beethoven and your other recent concerns I invite you to shift your gaze briefly to this transcluded text
