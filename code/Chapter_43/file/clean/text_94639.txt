Revert vandalism 

I realise there is an edit war going on regarding what nickname Reds versus Redcoats etc should be used by the fans  However one of the final edits before page protection was clearly a joke  Please revert this edit  theres no record of this being used  its a joke based on an incident last season when a squirrel ran onto the pitch during play
