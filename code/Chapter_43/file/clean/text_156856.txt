Actually a Subculture 

Ive seen at least a couple arguments over whether or not emo is a discernible modern genre or subculture of if its merely a pejorative term a sort of madeup scapegoat genre and subculture Of course none of this come from credible sources Do we have any Has anyone else heard anything similar 128186230124  

I dont completely understand what you just said or asked but yes we have sources that call it a subculture Just not the right sources appairintly sorry I spelled that wrong   

Emo is a genre of music Some sources lacking authority andor reliability call it a subculture  but many of them also make some interesting claims eg Emos worship death  certainly such religious beliefs may help set them apart as a subculture but this is of course totally untrue and nonsense   

Ive only seen one source that has said they worship death and that source was complete crap anyway Second some of the sources are certainly reliable they just lack authority which is what we need but also what we dont have so nothing can be doneboo bad sources Oh and Emo is a Subgenre of music LOL yeah I know Im being needlesly picky about what Emo is and what Emo is not but still it is a Subgenre of music IMO Emo is a Subculture but my oppinion is completely worthless as far as wikipedia is concerned Im not a good source none of us are LOL   

If they are known to misuse the word then that would make them unreliable Emos worship death is just one of a number of contentious claims that leads unlearned sources to the false idea that it is any more than a genre of music neonwhite   talk 

Course it would but I would like to know how all of them misuse Subculture Yes I do reliase your alluding to the MSN source at least thats how I see it but Id still like to know Also any source that says we worship death would probably be BS no So far that is the only contentious statement that Im seeing BTW it is more than a form of music we just dont have the sources that say it so those of us who want it to be more on wikipedia cant do anything oh well   

There is no evidence that it represents anything other than a genre of music that is why subculture is misused We cant have an article about a subculture that noone has defined regardless of whether a media sources uses the term It would be a one sentence article neonwhite   talk 

Thank you for explaining that Neon white   

As much as I agree with you we do need a more solid source perhaps we could browse well founded sites we know they are in the media a
