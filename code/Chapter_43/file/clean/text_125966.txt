Keep I personally know one patient who flew 1200 miles for surgery by this guy Â  
I note that  Did you mean 12000 miles Maine to Oregon is about 3000 miles So 1200 miles would be ChicagoPhoenix which is probably average for a surgeon with patients from all over the world  He certainly would have patients from 12000 to 15000 miles away who receive his unique handiwork emailing me is okay Thanks for helping keep that bit of information in the uberpedia
