Thanks for replying again What you said is true too but I want to be sure that I fully understood and addressed the issue Chaser brought up Or if anyone has further thoughts about that issue I would appreciate hearing about that as well  I want try to understand all the details pertaining to WP ahead of time in a possibly more neutral environment  
Ive also created a stub article Tricia Rose that you might be interested in
