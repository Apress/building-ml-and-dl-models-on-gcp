I dont know why you are saying that the cc refused to provide info That does not really need to be discussed here Most of the bunker articles that I wrote were made possible because because I learnt about these sites from the guy that is in charge of new members Some members had a lot to tell but lets not worry about that The explanation for the Bankstown Bunker photos is on the talk page for that article I was never blocked for this check my block logs for both websites 

I have provided new refs The cc removed the information about the Darling Harbour drain because of this situation The first ref is a hard copy so go and find your own The second ref covers some of the information in part
