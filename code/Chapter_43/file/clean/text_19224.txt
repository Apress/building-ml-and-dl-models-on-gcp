Interest in improving this article 

Hi Im not sure if anyone is watching this page but I wanted to introduce myself here as a representative on Wikipedia for the Motion Picture Association of America I work for the MPAA and my colleagues and I have noticed that this article is in bad shape We would like to assist volunteer editors in making this a better article both under Wikipedias guidelines and as an informative page about MPAA For example I think its important to replace the History text which borrows sometimes word for word from the  MPAA website With help from someone knowledgeable about Wikipedia Im working on a better version of this section and Ill hopefully be able to share that here soon For questions or thoughts about this page you can reply here or on my user talk page
