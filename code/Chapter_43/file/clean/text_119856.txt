Leopard kill in a tree 

I saw with interest your picture of a leopards kill hanging from a tree limb in the Serengeti  Do you by any chance know how the leopard gets the prey to hang like that  It seems draping the kill over a tree limb would seem the easiest and preferred way but hanging it by the heels without having fingers or opposable thumbs is pretty impressive  Just asking  Thanks
