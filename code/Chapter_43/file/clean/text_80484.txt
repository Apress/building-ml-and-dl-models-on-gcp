Hi 

Just a quick note about Tokyos sister relationships When you look at the article on Tokyo in the section on sister relationships youll find a footnote That footnote leads to a page on Tokyos official Web site Tokyo says that its sister relationship is with São Paulo State not São Paulo City Thats the reason I changed it back to State

Best regards
