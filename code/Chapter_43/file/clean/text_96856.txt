Please change irishborn British to irish or to irish who worked mainly in London because of the following The  says he was born AND grew up in Ireland apart from a stint in London during WW1 He then went travelling in 19261928 to London Berlin Paris and back to London Also when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did So hes irish until proven otherwise Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so Someones nationality cannot decided by concensus which is whats happening here Ignoring the above facts above would be more than disappointing but also from what we KNOW it it is incorrect and an injustice to be so arbitrary 1097821158  1405 11 August 2013
