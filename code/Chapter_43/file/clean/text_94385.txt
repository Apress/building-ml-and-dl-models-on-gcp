This is exactly the point I am claiming that WoRMS cites them whether or not that is true is actually irrelevant here You are making fresh unpublished claims That is original research which is absolutely forbidden certainly on Wikipedia and I expect on Wikispecies as well Until you can learn to accept Wikipedias policies I suggest you take a step back from editing Your edits are not helpful you are repeatedly engaging in edit wars and generally making a nuisance of yourself As someone who specialises in group work in the online world and is passionate about assisting people to collaborate using a range of online technologies and who trains people around the world in online facilitation skills vide this you are not coming across as someone particularly skilled in online collaboration Perhaps its time for you to return to the day job
