Military equipment
I wonder what kind of format the table should have and what info should it contain There are three kinds of important info about equipment 1 which systems the combatant had 2 how many of those systems they had 3 which systems were deployed to the theatre or used during the war 4 how many systems were lost during the war

Would it be possible to have all that info in one table or should we make multiple tables or would that be too much
