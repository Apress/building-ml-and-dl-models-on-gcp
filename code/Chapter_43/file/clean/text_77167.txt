4 ethnic groups in duklja the Dukljans being the latins who were slavicspeaking catholics who were converted by stefan nemanja when he annexed Duklja i believe todays Montenegrins to be the descendents of these people
The balsici where either albanian or vlach origin and promoted a independent zeta you cannot deny this there is nothing serbian about them except the fact that they spoke a dialect of it to me they are a symbol of the present day Montenegrin identity  which is heavily mixed with croatian and albanian culturesmixing of tribes croatian nameslast names
All this said I view the Balsici Montenegrins although in those times they would be Zetan or Dukljan
