Julien there always exist contrary points of view People still take issue with the Earth being round But while one can have a contrary opinion that doesnt make said opinion a fact 

Gaywebmonkey has cited its sources  an interview with Corrigan published comments by Cobras attorneys email correspondence between Corrigan and an unnamed producer and statements by various antichild porn groups  The issue isnt those sources Its the fact that you havent provided one source for anything youve contributed to the article 

Ive changed your claiming comments  to stating Claiming is far less neutral than stating You are arguing the article was biased I was rectifying that situation None of which prohibits another party with knowledge of the issues in question from stating the opposite  as Cobras attorneys have done  But just changing stated to claims doesnt make something more neutral

Lastly the reason why citation is so important here is to allow anyone else to backtrack and read for themselves about the issues in question It brings a measure more of impartiality to the proceedings The rules here are the same for you as they are for me cite your sources
