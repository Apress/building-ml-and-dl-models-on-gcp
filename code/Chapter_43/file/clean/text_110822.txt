so mote it be 

i see in the history of so mote it be that you have it changed back to redirect to the five whatever kiss if i am doing this wrong and have the wrong person or whatever ignore this message i am currently studying Wicca of what i have heard everywhere else besides here it has nothing to do with the five kiss thing it is a phrase which lets our prayers to the goddess and god recognize our prayers and listen but of course Wicca is a malleable religion so a phrase which ends our prayers just might be related to some sexy blessing i dont know
