Does Propol have ownership of this article due to your inference that he very kindly agreed to stop restoring WPOWN If this was an article about Kilngon verbsor other fictional subjects then there would be absolute civility but when some nameless faceless avatar    named after some processed ditary fiber additve personally attacks my friend A real life person with the outright intent to damage my friends reputation I seen how this editor work in looking at the other subjects he has worked on so dont condescend to me about his agenda as it is self evident to any one who reads his editing history so Its hard not to feel his incivility towards my friend and apply the principle of reciprocity 

Now I do appreciate you working with me on this since you obviously have seen the flaws and the intent of some of the editors on this Biography and for that I am grateful MS VIRGIN Also I am grateful you have brought under control some of the more radical elements on this website and Im grateful as well  I the end want the same as you  an article which is truly Encyclopedic by the commonly accepted definition of that word and not some exercise in political axe grinding and attack Journalism I am grateful for you help

Now I will step back and watch tacitly and see how you and your editors are truly respectful of the task at hand  to write an honest and fair Biography of my friend a real person with out the axe grinding and other political partisan attack minutia of an political partisan attack article Thank you for you help
