please put this on ANI for me 

1 Civility  I made one comment on a users talk page in a semisandbox section that they made regarding dog meat that I thought it was inhumane and that some of the edits are based on nationalistic motives Yes this was a personal comment but it was certainly not racist nor directed at anyone in particular If you blocked every who ever made a comment conveying their personal opinion on a users talk page wikipedia would have about 3 editors left

Also I posted LOL that made me laugh on another users page I really dont see any problem with that

2 HarassmentStalking  as I outlined in my unblock request I have checked the edits of other editors and reverted when I saw the need These are not random editors these are editors who have brought themselves to my attention with their patterns of what I consider to be flawed edits This is how wikipedia works you make a dodgy edit people revert you check your edit history and see what other dodgy edits you have made taking action when needed

In short I see no reason whatsoever for me deserving a one week block for a personal comment a LOL and checking the edits of users who got my attention by their editing patterns
