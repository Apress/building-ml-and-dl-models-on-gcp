Spammy edits 

Ive been seeing a lot of bloat on this article recently Id like to point out that wiki is not a forum for promoting your favorite brand of linux

Also I edited the wording of the one sentence that said Currently site name I forgot has over 200 programs I added a specific date so that the article ages a bit easier
