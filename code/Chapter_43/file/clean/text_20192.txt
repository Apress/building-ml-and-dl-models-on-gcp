Yes feel free to revert  Im happy to go with the Florida legal records I did lots of researching before changing but did not have access to those details I believe Homeniuk is how it is spelled in Ukranian  and most likely how his family name would have spelled their name at some point in time but that may well have now evolved to Homenuik Either way you are right in saying a note should be added relating to the uncertainty over the spelling bigissue
