Yes just recently we proposed renaming the page from Transsexuality to Transsexualism so it appears to be a very controversial issue  As the Definitions section of this article suggests not everyone will be happy with any single term  For examples Jennifer Diane Reitz refers to transsexuality and Lynn Conway refers to transsexualism  If you search transsexuality and transsexualism on Google you will find more hits for transsexualism  Reality Resources an extrans ministry frequently uses transsexuality and to me transsexuality sounds like a sexual orientation  Of course some people do not like either of these terms  For example some people prefer Benjamins syndrome  but that definitely sounds like a disease  Andrea James has proposed the term interest in feminization for transsexual women who plan to transition  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female or desire to do so including those who do so for nontraditional reasons  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for nontraditional reasons I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic but I dont believe that it should be called a disease  All said I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject  Given the recent replies to this comment and the recent move debate I feel like consensus has already been established
