Yes thats how I assumed it worked as well but wheres this somewhere else that led to the creation of this article I would assume hip hop culture but the only place I find is hip hop music which also contains much more than a summary in its old school section Youre right that this article is meant to be an extension of another article but its currently only an extension of hip hop music and should therefore be called old school hip hop music

It might be wise to let old school hip hop redirect to old school hip hop music for a while however as many other articles link here When a section about old school hip hop appears in hip hop culture we could redirect old school hip hop there instead until that section grows big enough to justify its own article about general old school hip hop like you said
