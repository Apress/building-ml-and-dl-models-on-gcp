A quick question on Aaron López 

Im guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one Im using on the alltime MLS club rosters nationality by national team including youth national teams and in cases where there is no national team participation nationality by birthplace  Aaron López was born in Mexico raised in the US played ODP but never made an appearance for a US youth national teamand thus counts as Mexican correct  You indeed have him listed as Mexican here and since this is the most exhaustivelyresearched list on Wikipedia I assume that you are aware of everything I mentioned and based your decision on those factors  So anyway Im popping in to doublecheck my impression ODP does not count for purposes of determining nationality correct  Defender of Open Editing
