Epicyclic gear ratiospng 

Hi Wapcaplet Your diagram ImageEpicyclic gear ratiospng has been nominated for delisting from WikipediaFeatured pictures Not for anything to do with the diagram but simply because it is too small for current standards  Do you still have the source and could you possibly upload either 1 a larger version or 2 a svg version SVG is of course preferred nowadays and I am certain that it would save the image from delisting Many thanks    Talk
