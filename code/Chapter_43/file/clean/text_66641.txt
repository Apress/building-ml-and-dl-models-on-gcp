Laz please do not put your garbage on my talk pages Everything what was to be said is on those discussion pages I think that should be quite enough And again to repeat that those maps are good If you have some valid and verified source which would show otherways they can be easily changed But we went through all of this and Im not going to get into more circles with you Your fraud stories take to someone else  Isnt that simple enough  razgovor 
Hey do not delete what is posted It is not garbage You yourself admitted that your first map had mistakes and then fixed it up by producing a second Yet you keep the first one in wikipedia How is that not a contradiction You then delete my post here which I bring back now and attack me Youre the guilty one here Ill show you a source  compare the two or three versions that you have They are very different The least that you can do is delete the one that is more incorrect
