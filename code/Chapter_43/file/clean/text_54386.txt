It is contentious rejected disputed poorly sourced but I suppose tabloid journalism could be argued although sensationalizing a crime story is at the very heart of tabloid journalism My main point is that we are likely running afoul of NPOV by not clearly linking these episodes as one mans 10year effort to recast the murders That his research rejects facts that dont align with his beliefs his sourcing is poor he exploits pretty much all the subjects and his main points are pretty much rejected The sourcing is there but our structure is perhaps unintentionally misleading Im open to the best ways to address these issues
