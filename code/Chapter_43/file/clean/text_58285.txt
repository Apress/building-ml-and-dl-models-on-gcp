Ian Curtiss house 

I think I had gotten the right corner when I planned my little preWikimania day trip from LondonI just screwed up the address when I typed the filename  It seems based on this that my picture is of the far corner rather than the one that was the actual house yup  this seems to support that I think I even printed out the linked map and brought it along Its hard to tell because the houses are only incidentally numbered The right house may well be the one at left in this image I knew at least I was in the right neighborhood

Anyway it seems you live a lot closer to Macclesfield than I do Feel free to take a picture of the right house and put it in if you are able
