Guinnog the POV pushing that folks like Morton deal with leaves little room at times for compromise Their ongoing attempts to misuse Wikipedia as an advocacy platform for their conspiracy theories is something that doesnt have to be condoned at any time Morton has made some alterations to his userpage that is in keeping with with the current policy maybe a couple other areas could use some reduction in opinion If this is the only userpage that details an editors major emphasis to the project that would be news to me If Morton wishes to demostrate on his userpage the articles he is glad to see deleted or the ones he thinks shjould be there is no reason he cant There is also no reaosn he cant provide as a disclaimer his major emphasis on this project to keep 911 conspiracy theory rhetoric minimized in accordance with the undue weight clause of NPOV I support Mortons efforts to keep this nonsense on Wikipedia in its proper place
