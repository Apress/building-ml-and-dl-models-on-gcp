Cleaned up a lot of the lists 

Too much stuff was being added to this article which only passively referenced the Ides of March  Bands mentioning it in their lyrics  People in film happening to die on March 15th  Used as a couple lines of dialogue in a tv show  These uses arent notable  Unless the phrase IoM is integral to the work being referenced it really should not be included in any lists here doing otherwise would make all of the lists impossible to complete as well as making the article unnecessarily lengthy
