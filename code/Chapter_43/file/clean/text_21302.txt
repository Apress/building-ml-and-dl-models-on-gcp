Please stop disambiguating Christ 

Hello I realize that at the present Christ is a disambiguation page but your edits are sometimes not making sense Can you please concentrate on another project For example in the Perpetual virginity of Mary entry you altered a quote that did not say Jesus Christ In the entry for Trinity you made it say Jesus Christ when Christ seems more to the point at that instance There is a subtle nuance that you are not catching Please work on something else   msg 0642 19 Jun 2004 UTC
