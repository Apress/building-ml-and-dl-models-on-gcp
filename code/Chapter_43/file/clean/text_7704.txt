Lack of FollowUp by UserKtr101Kevin Rutherford on deletion made 26 November 2011  is confirmed VANDALISM by lack of response after 97 days 

Mr Rutherford has made no attempt to answer here about his deletion of sourced content whose veracity is as strong or stronger than what UserMikenorton above assesses as reliable sources ie Orey Cal 2006 book as source material gleefully he wrote above Thats much better  I can actually see the wood for the trees now  In addition by implication UserMikenorton is implying that wikipedia articles themselves are unreliable as sources  This is evidence for censorship by UserMikenorton as well  If you want to be taken seriously UserMikenorton I suggest you read and comprehend the deleted material before spouting misrepresenatations of fact about the deleted material
