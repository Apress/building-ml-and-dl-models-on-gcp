I can provide a dissenting opinion I dont think that exact RfC is strictly applicable here or should be further hardened into policy in this article An RfC from one article is not sufficient justification for enacting similar changes to another article even if both articles cover similar topics The races should be mentioned in the bios because race is biographical information Other than that unless there is good evidence that this was a racially motivated death is there any evidence of such whatsoever its simply not relevant I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios and omit them in the lede I should also note that many of our sources are forprofit media outlets who have no qualms about distorting stories to make them fit their most profitable narrative agenda which in this era is blackwhite racial conflict the coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting is an excellent example We should hold ourselves to a higher standard than our sources  83922813
