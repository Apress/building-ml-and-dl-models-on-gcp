San Salvador crime section
it is not fair for san salvador to have a crime section if san salvador is goin to have one then one should be put on all latin american countries because they all have crime and particularly nicaragua has crime extreme poverty and many corruption issues and in the MS section i have article that are reliable that state that mexicans guatemalans and nicaraguans are part of the MS13 as well okay it is not fair for san salvador like i said i will defenetly work on putiing one in every single latin american country or you can just take the crime section off san salvador wich is the best thing to do because it is not right at all for san salvador to be the only one with a crime section if one coutry has it they all need one
