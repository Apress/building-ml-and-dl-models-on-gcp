Actually the orginal poster is right Im going to dig a little bit more but it would seem that not only was the Sarcee Training Area leased But it seemed to have incorporated the communities of Signal Hill Battalion Park Currie Barracks Mount Royal College Garrison Woods etc etc etc That a combination of land grabs pressurized land sales of surrendered lands which the Tsuu Tinas were not adquately compensated with IN ADDITION to the Weasel head areas the mouth of the Glenmore This would be interesting
