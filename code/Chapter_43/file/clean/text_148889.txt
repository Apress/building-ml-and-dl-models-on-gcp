Heres a clip from Sedlars film which shows first issue of the magazine titled Ustaša which Pavelić began publishing in the spring of 1930 skip to 313 Although stylized the header clearly shows an asymmetrical U with a bomb in it symbolizing revolutionary struggle
At 337 in the same clip a magazine cut out showing the UHRO organization logo is shown as printed by them  an asymmetrical U a flaming bomb inside it and a chequoy on the bomb It looks just like the one Nanin7 had made and DIREKTOR removed bar the darkblue color which Nanin7 used to fill in the letter U The original is blackandwhite but the letter itself clearly wasnt meant to be black
At 503 in the same clip the front page of the organizations statute is shown again with the same logo as described above dated 1932
At 522 the narrator talks about the organization logo directly and says that The Ustaša was defined as a revolutionary fighter also indicated by their logo which first appeared in the masthead of the magazine Ustaša in 1930 Inside a blue letter U a silver hand grenade is depicted with red flames coming out of it In the centre of the bomb a small Croatian coat of arms is shown with the top left field in silver As he is saying that yet another picture of the logo is being shown this one seems to be an enamel badge The text btw was written by one Mario Jareb a historian who wrote several books on the history of the Ustaše as well as one on the history of Croatian national symbols
At 555 in the same clip front page of yet another party newspaper titled Nezavisna država Hrvatska published in New York Chicago Pittsburgh and San Francisco with the same logo shown this time in the form of an initial in the main headline dated 1 May 1934 
So I dont know how much more official can it get As for the several variant thing  I can only assume they dropped the bomb once NDH was established since per their logic the revolutionary struggle has achieved its goal and replaced it with just a chequoy which was then used as a state symbol later on Ive never seen a cross in combination in contemporary use only in modern farright graffiti but I may be wrong Either way this article is about the Ustaše partymovement and this version is the closest we will ever come to what was their official symbol Only the shade of the color blue can be considered debatable I tend to think it was probably lighter blue than what Nanin7 used  talk
