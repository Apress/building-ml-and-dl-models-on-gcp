Heh  Nothing of the sort  I just think theres a bit of history missing here  Either Russian Ashkenazim were adopted into the Bukharan fold so to speak which I would regard as normal and halakhically proper or the Bukharans for whatever reason set about Russifying their surnames  In either case whatever happened seems me worthy of mention  The other possibility is that the people being tagged as Bukharan Jews are not actually Bukharan but rather Ashkenazim who never felt obliged by halakha viz the situation in il to integrate into the local community and are therefore being inaccurately tagged as Bukharan rather than as Jews from Uzbekistan  No witch hunt just a request for clarification  I do my best to keep my misgivings about what I perceive as an Ashkenazi desire for hegemony out of my editorial interests on Wikipedia  Kol tov talk
