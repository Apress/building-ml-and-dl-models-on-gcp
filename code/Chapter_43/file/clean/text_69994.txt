Double You Tee Eff 
As you can probably tell by now I am sort of new at using Wikipedia I just noticed on almost every talk page I have talked on you have chosen to talk back as well Are you watching this account or something Do you like dog fighting Do you like sports Do you like professional sports Do you realize that I can suggest you to do things by editing talk pages Do you like spending so much time on the internet Wouldnt your time be better spent writing articles about things you understand or care about rather than following me Errr I know my time would be better spent not responding to you
