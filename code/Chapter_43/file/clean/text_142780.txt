By all means keep the list in the article all I suggested was that we shouldnt list potential champions because there are no other titles to win at present

Think of it like the WCW Triple Crown listng acknowledge those who made it but it would just clutter up the article to list those who are one away when the titles dont exist anymore

Same idea with the ECW TC  Give credit to those who got there but until the titles come back there can be no other TC winners

By the way Anakinjmt Thanks for backing me up in the US Title debate
