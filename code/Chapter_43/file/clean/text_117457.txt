Hmm which part of my assertion denied that Duryodhan was a Kuru and the victorious Pandavas were not Thats my point regarding understanding English rather than yours of fabricating lineages Im afraid other than names on a page even YOU cannot prove 100 who you are a direct descendant of It is not 100 guaranteed and no dna scientist will stand with you on that one at all BTW if Maharaja Janamejaya my ancestor was referred to as the King of the Kurus then that would indicate that he was King over ALL kurus Even your exiled ancestors too  So less attacks less provocation and lets for the sake of the article do some decent groundwork and clean it up This page has deteriorated enough
