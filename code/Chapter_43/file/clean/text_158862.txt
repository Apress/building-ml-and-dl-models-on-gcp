Wait a sec Nufy8 In a very old version of Darth Malaks page it said he was succeeded by the triad of Traya Nihilus and Sion Then I realized this could be impossible because Traya was the master of both Because of this she succeeded Malak and in turn Sion and Nihilus both succeeded their master Since I have not read up that much on thier histories I asssume they didnt murder each other It seems Sion was somehow convinced by Exile to kill himself but I dont know what happened to Nihilus  1730 20 Jun 2005 UTC
