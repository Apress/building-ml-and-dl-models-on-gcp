Such intransigent behaviour is not compatible with Wikipedias policies of consensusbuilding and collaborative editing it only serves to incite edit wars  Anyway could you please explain why you consider the referece a strawman and unnecessary  We are talking about Einstein a wellknown socialist a household name and the epitome of intelligence  Also after reading my previous comment and the source are you still contending that socialism isnt opposed to individualism

Your substitute is not adequate either therefore it is asserted by some critics that socialistic is less individualistic  Firstly the use of a weasel words is strongly discouraged at Wikipedia please read WPAWW for more information  Secondly socialism is less individualistic than what  This entry is quite ambiguous  Finally I have a reputable source to defend my edit whereas you do not  Overall your edit violates two Wikipedia policies No Orginal Research and Avoid Weasel Words
