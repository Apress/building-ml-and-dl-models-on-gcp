Really its not Im Australian dont regard myself as a PCpusher but Id think Uluru has moved ahead of Ayers Rock as the preferred name by most people Certainly when I was younger in the 1980s it was pretty much unheard of to say Uluru and anything other than Ayers Rick made you look like some sort of lefty nutter but in the last 10 years or so its changed Oh and using Qantas as an example is probably not ideal  the airport they fly to is called Ayers Rock so its understandable theyd prefer that name Anyway just my 2c   0502 18 June 2014
