No apologies 

I make no apologies for what I said on the humanities reference desk At times I may have gone too far elsewhere in wikipedia but not in this instance When people say stupid things on the reference desk I have no qualms about pointing this out and am not likely to change any time in the future especially when it is unlikely the person who asked the question is being sincere Note that assume good faith doesnt really apply in the reference desk else we wouldnt be able to suggest that users are asking homework questions which we do all the time or otherwise just wasting our time which we do as well I rarely frequent the humanities reference desk mostly science only so perhaps you dont get as many cranks at humanities but really I dont care Stupid questions deserve pointed replies Anyway Ive said my piece and dont want to debate this anymore As such Im likely to ignore any further follow ups by you If you feel my comments so bad that you wish to seek outside assitance thats up to you
