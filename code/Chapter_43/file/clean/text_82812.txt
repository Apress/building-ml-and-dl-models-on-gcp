Delicious carbuncle please read my statementit is no joke The fun has stopped now I apologized and wanted to make peace with the people who followed us for the past three years ever since I exposed them on Blogcritics on my first blog
After having received emails which threatened me and which also asked me to kill myself I think this entire case has taken on another level

This is no joke Delicious carbuncle and it is sad that you are still hiding behind a silly name
What is the sense behind this Do you not realize what harm a Lori Drew did to others

We all know how you defend your right to remain ANONYMOUS but I have been threatened with physical harm and I have reason to believe that YOU Delicious carbuncle are one of the six people who wanted to come to my home tie me up on a chair and duct tape me since another member just revealed all the members of this vicious Marilyn Monroe fan group gang of obsessive fanatics with the psychopath characteristics

Please stop your phony edits and stick to the truth 

Thank you
