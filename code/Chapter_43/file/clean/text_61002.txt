Firstly why were you so quick as to ban me The user at hand had used past information to build a case to ban me when I had learnt my lessons he was in the wrong and yet you didnt even let me defend my case How would I go about removing this ban from my history I only lost patiance with the user because he singles me out as a Muslim then uses that information to suggest Im censuring things Is there any justice in that If you look at the history of the article mentioned Islamist demonstration then you would see my intentions were clearly constructive I have had trouble with this user before in WPANI he named me as a Muslim fanatic which I took out I have been serving Wikipedia for nearly a year now while the user who was so quick to ban me has served little He almost always reverts my edits in that article because Im a Muslim Is this not discrimination  Talk Contribs
