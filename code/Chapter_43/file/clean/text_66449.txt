There are no claims to falafel being from Cairo In fact they call it something else there On the other hand we have multiple sources discussing its prevalence in Alexandria And we have the luxury of knowing that Alexandria was a Coptic city a long time ago But you still have ignored my solution You have chosen to continue arguing when I laid out what I see as a possible roadmap to straightening it out It appears to me that you would rather argue about it If I am wrong which I should be if we are AGF then please feel free to actually discuss a solution instead of trying to poke holes in arguments We do not need to pretend to be lawyers here You know the argument and the possible solutions So the best thing for the project would be for you to actually attempt to improve the article instead of using the talk page to continue the battle Enough with the politics and games You can chose to be a contributor here and not make the same mistakes as those that have been rightfully banned
