NO my map is placed in Afghanistans article in regards to show the area and names of the territories from 15th century to 18th century It has nothing to do with Safavid or other empires Its simply a geographical map and dont try to find meaningless reasons to remove this map or I will have no other choice but to bring administrators to resolve this I uploaded the map the proper way by it being an antire image You uploaded half of the image which is a violation and I can report you for that Youre purpose is to hide the geography of Afghanistans past and mines is to reveal it You have no chances of winning
