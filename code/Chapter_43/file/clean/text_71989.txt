Wikipedia Index of Information or Theological Authority 
As far as I was concerned Wikipedia is a place for information not a place to assert beliefs Maria is truly the Mother of God De Fide if Mary was not Mother of God then Jesus was in fact not God Really now Is that a fact Or is that the authoritive Roman Catholic view Since it is that is how it should be stated According to Roman Catholicism Maria is thee mother of god as opposed to presenting this as fact This is an encyclopedia not a Roman Catholic mouthpiece I dont adhere to Christianity or any religion for that matter but I find this assertion absurd Assuming for a moment that there is actually a figure called god and there was a personage named MaryMaria and the Bible is the ultimate authority if Mary was not Mother of God then Jesus was in fact not God is an theologically anachronistic statement If in the beginning god created the heaven and earth and Mary came a long time afterwards then we have a big problem because if Mary is THEE mother of god then god couldnt have been around to create Adam Even and all the people leading up to Mary If god existed before Mary and Jesus was supposed to be god than this would make Mary basically a surrogate womb with no connection to god whatsoever Im no Christian but please Present the views and beliefs as they are views and beliefs and not as matteroffact thank you
