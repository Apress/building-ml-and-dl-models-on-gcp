Image copyright tags
Thanks for uploading ImageMelvinhousejpg I notice it currently doesnt have an image copyright tag 

Could you add one to let us know its copyright status You can use gfdl if you release it under the GFDL or fairuse if you claim fair use etc If you dont know what any of this means just let me know where you got the images and Ill tag them for you

Thanks so much   Talk 0234 26 Apr 2005 UTC
