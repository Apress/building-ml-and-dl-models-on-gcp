nonNPOV  inaccurate information 

Regarding the piece of text Since most of those hadith are on the authority of Abu Huraira most Shia dismiss them as a sad examples of what happens when all Sahaba are counted as trustworthy A clear breach in Tawhid the belief that God is above its creation

Reasons for removal

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith 

 The phrase most shia does not cite any authority or text and could therefore be completely fabricated Not to mention that there are over a dozen subsects among the shia

 sad examples of what happens  thats a nonNPOV nonNeutral Point Of View

 See God as one sees the full moon or the sun in the sky Or seeing part of God on the day of judgement is not a contradiction that God is above His not its creatures in every respect
