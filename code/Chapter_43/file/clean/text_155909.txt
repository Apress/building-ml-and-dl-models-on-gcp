Shiotani Teiko And dozens and dozens more just like it

Hi You created an article saying in full Shiotani Teiko 塩谷定好 しおたに ていこう 1899  1988 was a renowned Japanese photographer

Actually its Teikō not Teiko and according to WPs silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani But thats not the main problem which is that hes described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi 栗林慧 くりばやし さとし born 1939 is a renowned Japanese photographer Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo 渡辺兼人 わたなべ かねんど born 1947 is a renowned Japanese photographer Or Orihara Kei 折原恵 おりはら けい born 1948 is a renowned Japanese photographer And so on and so on and so on Which all means that somebody looking among CategoryJapanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub

I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles No on my thumbs UserPinkville and myself But hes busy and I am too Id rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1 Its an interesting proof of bot concept exercise but is it good for anything else 

Tell you what Ill match you one for one You turn two of these into articles Ill turn two into articles You turn ten into articles Ill turn ten into articles How does that sound   

Thats a great challenge Youre on   talk random 

OK then Do tell me when youve done one as I cant keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist Well actually I can but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist Also Ill be intercoursingly busy during the next month so in the shortmedium term I may only be able to match you up to ten

Im sure Ive got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people so I ought to be able to do more

Whats odd about the list are some conspicuous absences Not just people I think are good but people who rightly or wrongly are celebrated and successful Asai Shinpei is one and there are more though I cant think of them right now 

Not that its any of my business really but did you scarf the list from User20th Century Art Zenhans page or do something else   

Yeah I scraped from Zenhan Ill let you know here or on your talk page when I have one ready I dont think I can make any of them featured but legitimately nonstub is the goal All the best   talk random 

Okay heres my first Ichiki Shiro Its not much beyond a stub but its something It took an hour of research and I think I found all the info thats anywhere on the web regarding Mr Ichiki By the way was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo in the Edo period of course and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo so he couldnt have been a Gokenin But I dont think he was a warrior so I dont know So far as I can tell all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto Am I correct in my inference   talk random 

Damn youre fast 

Unfortunately I dont know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like On several occasions Ive tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat I suppose I cant separate it from the hammily acted cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the inlaws LordAmeth might know And this photographers right up Pinkvilles street   

Hows this for a progress indicator   
Great   talk random 
Yup except for a number of factors one of which is that its problematical copyrightwise or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one UserQuadell Ive already chucked in one extra list and Ill certainly add one more and I may add one after that perhaps it can then be described as an original creation All this is delaying my editing of any article Still Ill get around to that too in time   
I hope that Ive no
