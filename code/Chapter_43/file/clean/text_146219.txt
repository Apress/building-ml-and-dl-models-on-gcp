The Michael Jackson post was simply a result of a minute of gullibility I thought Anythings Possible though Curps being MJ was highly unlikely Some minutes afterwards I surmised that MJ would be too busy IRL to ever edit as much on WP as Curps does The reason for posting on the MJ article talk page was so maybe I could get a followup from other users as to who Curps really is I realized afterwards that there were better places to ask

The edit at Jesse Jackson was to remove what I thought was Vandalism How could a prominent reverend have an extramarital affair I thought After FreplySpang reverted it I went to Google to find evidence and it turns out he really did father a child from an extramarital affair in 1999

Asking for photos of other admins wasnt intended as harrassment Many other admins already had photos posted on their userpages andor the WPFacebook and I was curious about what some admins looked like that didnt have photos here therefore I asked them politely but somebody decided to misconstrue these requests as harrassment
