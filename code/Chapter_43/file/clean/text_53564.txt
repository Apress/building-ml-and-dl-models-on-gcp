I thought it was self explanatory I guess not It is not a spoof it is a freelance article filler for the issue but not taken seriously and the list was not created by a noted music critic or someone of note in the music industry in Japan this would be someone like Masanori Ito and the magazine even makes sure to mention it is biased and arbitrary they even made note of that on the cover and again my point is how is this acceptable for the wikipedia I cant even believe I need to ask that should VH1 top 10 lists of the greatest rock songs of all time etc be listed in the relevant wiki articles as an award or achievement as well That is neither an award or achievement Apart from that it provides no information to the articles It is fancruft nonsense My question was how is it acceptable for the wikipedia and especially given the fact it is biased and randomly put together273314393
