Ive read WPABK more carefully and the way I interpret it is either Walter tried to evade the block or someone else using that IP address tried to edit If a user who wasnt blocked is autoblocked I assume we should remove the autoblock but in these circumstances do we do any investigation into the attempted edit Im not accusing Walter of anything btw Im just trying to understand what the appropriate course is to take
