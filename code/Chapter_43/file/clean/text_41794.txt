I clarified the above comment somewhat  public v nonpublic applies equally on both projects but is separate from notability  Public figures expressly give up certain rights to privacy by the nature of their jobs  The equivalent to notability on commons is part of an imagefile that has plausible educational use  Yes there a similar guideline could be proposed here that people who ask for their articles to be removed would be refused only where the article was sufficiently important to justify the refusal
