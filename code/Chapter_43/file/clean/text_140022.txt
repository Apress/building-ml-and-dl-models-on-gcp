Please read WPLEDELength For an article of this length the lede should be 12 paragraphs long not three sentences It is a fallacy that the lede of an article is meant to do the bare minimum to introduce the subject it should serve as an acceptable overview of the entire article Right now roughly 75 of the article has no representation at all in the lede Ill be retagging on my next pass if the lede remains inadequate Chris Cunningham not at work  talk
