Hi Bryan I am not a moderator and have no say in whether you can resubmit that article I dont remember it specifically but I see that I tagged it for speedy deletion as a hoax and that someone who IS a moderator must have agreed and deleted it If you want to resubmit it I recommend that you make sure the article is supported by independent references so that people can be sure the article is authentic
