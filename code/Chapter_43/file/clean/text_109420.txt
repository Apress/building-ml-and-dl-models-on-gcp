Caught in the merge crossfire 

Thanks
Just to say thank you for your help dealing with my opposition to the merger proposal for Bispham High School Arts College which linked into the Portsmouth and Southampton merger proposals simply because the proposer who appears to have been using these merger proposals to make a point rather than discussing them anywhere chose the school seemingly at random after they saw it mentioned on the Wikipedia Schools project talk page Not being sure what to do about this your help in supporting my opposition to the merger and removal of the tag has been really useful and much appreciated Talk 

You are welcome it is a shame that Bispham High School Arts College got caught in the crossfire  I know how difficult it is to put together an acceptably cited entry for a school especially one with a short history having spent the best part of a day on Admiral Lord Nelson School Portsmouth back when the Portsmouth nonsense first started  

I must say the infobox and logo make the page look very professional I must do the same later in the week

You might find these links useful assuming I have the right school
