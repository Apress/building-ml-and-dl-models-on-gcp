That thing would be extremely hard to hold Ive played 8 string Ibanez guitars and couldnt fit my hand around them 

Is there any information on its factory tuning Musicians using that many strings on electric guitars are usually playing in a subgenre of jazz or heavy metal and metal guitarists are known for downtuning I personally wouldnt be sure it uses Yepes tuning so Ill have a look around and see if i can find any info for you58161124131  0234 30
