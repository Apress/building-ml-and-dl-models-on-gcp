WW2 

It is also of my opinion that grass is green and that temperatures below zero are freezing Should I get references for those as well
What Ive written is based on the facts written on the wikipedia WW2 article itself As the introduction is a brief summary I thought it would be more concise the way I have put it
Thanks
