Battery 

The battery for the 60D is not the same as the 2 digit line such as the 30D or 50D  It uses the same battery as the 5D and 7D
Although for such a short article with such little information this bit of information seems unimportant

In addition to this line sounding like nonsense
ISO with both steps 1 fstop steps and 13 fstop steps
it is also inaccurate  This is not a change from the 50D  The 50D also has the option of either full stop increments or 13 stop increments for ISO settings
