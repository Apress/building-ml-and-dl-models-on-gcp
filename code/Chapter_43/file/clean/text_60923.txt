Hello
Hi Harebag  Welcome  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police 
Department I thought it was a joke  It is real  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf  Hes a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground  Any suggestions for improvement let me know  As for your article I suggest a little background  Mention the city and state name  Fix the link  Good Luck on editing  

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD Whos the chief Any major history Big crime solved Any controversy or major lawsuit against it When was it established Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established if so when  These are just tips  Otherwise there is a risk that someone will petition for the articles deletion because there is a board for that thus destroying your hard work  Thats the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly  I do plan to add more to my article though
