Ms Barber wrote In a united effort the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year  

Ms BarberHow many of those puppies were produced by your kennel  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs

You and those supporting your clubregistry have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests while appearing rude insulting superiorminded and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you founded and the other breeders affiliated with your registry  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do as I cant imagine anyone with any intelligence and selfesteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior much less purchase any puppiesdogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion

You claim a lot but you provide no independent support for your claims only your own writings on your own website  You claim anyone producing dogs other than you or your registry are frauds yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings as evidence You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are in it for the money yet

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined through your wholly and coowned breeding dogs  Your website httpwwwnewzionshilohsorgupcoming_littershtm for this Winter alone shows you are producing ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through coownership breedings  Eleven litters even conservatively speaking could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES  And you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce 9002500  After the puppybuyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter you also contractually reserve the right at your own discretion to substitute a puppy from another compatible again based on your own determination litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the substitute puppy you decide to offer them
see httpwwwnewzionshilohsorgPolicies_N_PriceshtmNew Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equalhigher value that is compatible with your exact requirements

It appears that once monies are given are given to you your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you produce who display congenitalhereditary problems requiring resulting astronomicalextensive veterinary fees
  
You require your puppybuyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you produce them but you also require puppybuyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights for breedable dogs you require the dogs new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future andor you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout hisher life 

You have no stated policy on your website page httpwwwnewzionshilohsorgPolicies_N_Priceshtm re your own personal policycommitment to rescue and makefind a home for for any of the puppiesdogs you produce should they become unwanted homeless andor end up in shelters or in abusive situations

Your Policies and Prices make no mention of a contractual requirement by you with the signed contractual commitment of your puppybuyers to spayneuter their new pets in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs in general  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwantedeuthanzied dogs in the US 2 million  including 25 of which are purebred dogs is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion
 
Your website does not list any independent references such as recommendinggoverning affiliations ie Better Business Bureau approval ratings ie OFA PennHip CERF or other professional organizations to which you belong ie American Dog Owners Association the the Delta Society therapy dog training or agility organizations etc only your own dog clubSSDCA you own dog registry ISSR and your own literature except some very limited information by Dr Padgett and numerous and ri
