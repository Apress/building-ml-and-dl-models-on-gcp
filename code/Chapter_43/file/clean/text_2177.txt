Sorry I didnt write a summary Nevertheless the reason I removed it was because it was included in the sentence quite arbitrary and borderline OR The only party to have a continous steady increase in membership over many years is the Progress Party The text had also included the Labour Party on a basis of a short increase for one two or threee years but if you look at the article for the party it had 200000 members in the 1950s and around 50000 today That is NOT a continous steady increase
