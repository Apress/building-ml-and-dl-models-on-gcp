Yet despite the work of so many in this room like David Garrard Michael Heller and the Jewish community as a whole we have a desperate need to renew and replenish values of service to others compassion and responsibility to those in need

it was obvious anyway but why let the obvious get in the way of a bit of WPPoint 
Ambiguous  Find something reputable that clearly states hes a Jew please talk 

it is not ambiguous the ldr of the tory party is addressing Conservative Friends of Israel and speaks of 2 individuals and the jwsh cmnty as a whole how else can u interpret that plus hes in ort and sponsors the UK Jewish Film Festival what mr do u want  his brith certificate  

The link mentions two individuals and then the Jewish community it doesnt say he is part of that community  As for his many interests he may be a Judeophile or married to a Jew  who knows  The point is we dont do our own original research here instead we rely on reliable sources  Find me a reliable source that describes him as Jewish if hes so involved and so obviously Jewish as you say then that should be difficult should it talk 

if i say jay slim and the wikipedia community as a whole i am not simply mentioning 2 individuals and a unconnected community because the 2 indivs r included in the community by the phrase as a whole if u cant grasp this u r not fit to edit the english wiki but of course u can grasp it
