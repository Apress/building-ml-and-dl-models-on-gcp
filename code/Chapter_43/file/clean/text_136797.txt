I havent reverted anything  and I certainly havent insisted on anything with respect to format changes  I even said I agreed with you about the paragraph length issue I originally came upon this because  I was genuinely puzzled as to why such a bitter argument was going on when I couldnt really see any significant content differences  And then obviously we  got into it and I got mad  But Ive made no changes to the content of the page and I dont think I ever made any statement which  can be attributed as support of any particular stylistic setup of this or any other article
