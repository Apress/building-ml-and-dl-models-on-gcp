I have not attacked anyone in this discussionI incorrectly assumed he was an admin but the fact that he has broke wikipedia policy and community  by deleting a section without editor consensus and then used threats against editors to cement his position is WRONG The fact that I called him out on it is not a personal attack it is the truth 
Regardless the point remains and I will be returning the section I think that we as editors should work on cleaning the section up and providing proper cites Beyond this I will admit the section is very jumbled and has some topics that could be left out as they do not pertain to GW but rather criticisms against the games
