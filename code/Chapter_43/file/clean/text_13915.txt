Dithering here 

Im sorry we havent met sooner  There is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with  His name is UserTharkunColl an AngloSaxonist  English traditionalists even the proCeltic proRoman are apparently the bane of the British Isles here at Wikipedia but I dont know about that in real life considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant  Yes its said to be more accepting than the proud Teutonic approach to English identification although it seems as though the Celtofascists here are trying to spin the English alone as foreign to the Isles even though it is easy to discover the Celtic origins in Roman Europe especially the Brythonic kind as much as AngloSaxon European ties are to the postClassical Rome of Charlemagne and other Holy Roman Germanics  They think that proCeltic proRoman means hostile cultural appropriation as they have identified you as the other the big pink elephant in the room  It is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile mutualexclusionary factions of Celt Roman and German for most people involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another but hardly any singular Romanists Im afraid  Perhaps I should try that  Imagine the doublewhammy of negativity from the CeltoGermanicists  Ahhtheres no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed it seems

Incidentally if youd like to get worked up elsewhere go check out the archives of that talk pagehere for instance  In that article it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the Greeks bestowed the name British Isles upon that set of islands off of Gaul and that is the ultimate origin as they instead focus exclusively upon the TudorStuart settlement extreme violation of WPWEIGHT and barely even narrowly WPSYNTH so wrapped up in violations of WPNOR which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect nor do they care to see that Roman Britain was only that part of Albion that part of the BI in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by Rome even as Erin would go freenot contradicting the fact that they are both British whatever that originally meant aside from the Trojan story  Just about any and all BI related pages are vicious black holes and often the only way to go about it is by using extreme caution and wisdom  You will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you dont fit their profile then you are wrong not just what you happen to do or write it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works  Many times after selecting a target they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough they will have provoked thee into becoming banned just to see you squirm as they do whatever it is they wish to put the spin on this or that subject according to their absolutist truisms  Of course you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins wont even bother to level the playing field for you only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery  They will most likely base their complaints upon improper procedures which is Orwellian codespeak for we dont like what he stands for lets overwhelm him in numbers

All said it is very nice to meet youyou like me with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving would probably enjoy this a lot  Ive been a fan for the longest time of you TharkunColl
