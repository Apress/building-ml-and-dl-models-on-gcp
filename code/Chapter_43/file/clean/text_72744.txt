This is an excellent question though perhaps not in the right forum While I agree that the vast majority of tenured academics are not notable at most schools tenure is not really that hard there is the question of top notch professors who are respected by their communities but dont make it into the popular press Should we have a different notability criterion for them My feeling is that there is no hurry If a professor is significant in his or her community theyll sooner or later get a chair at their presumably well known university and that for us is a sufficient condition for inclusion As with everything else we need some reliable indicator of notability and these indicators exist in academia so we shouldnt get into the business of trying to determine notability ourselves   comment
