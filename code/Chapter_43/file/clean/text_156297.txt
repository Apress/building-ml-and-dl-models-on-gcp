Disruption

Sysops may block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia or pose any kind of threat to it Such disruption may include but is not limited to changing other users signed comments making deliberately misleading edits harassment excessive personal attacks and inserting material that may be defamatory Users will normally be warned before they are blocked

Sysops may also block new user accounts that make lots of disruptive edits Reincarnations of blocked disruptive users are likely to be reblocked particularly if they edit in a way that suggests they are likely to continue being disruptive
