A consensus that the City and County would be called Londonderry and the Council would be called Derry City Council along with the airport being called City of Derry Airport was reached by elected representatives who sit on Derry City Council There is not going to be a fairer consensus reached than that But given that the consensus on wikipedia was voted on by a group of people of unknownalthough slightly obvious persuasion did you honestly think the outcome would be a fair representative It seems that if I got enough people together I could pretty much change the name of anything or any place if based on consensus
