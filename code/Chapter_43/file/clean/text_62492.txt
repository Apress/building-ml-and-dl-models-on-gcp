Hi Ben

Thanks for your note As you noted normally I dont go around doing that but the user in question has been gumming up the works with endless such requests  often on stubs and substubs that she has just created  after a number of people have pleaded with the user to stop and after the WikipediaMentorship Committee has been offering help and guidance Ive been trying to be careful about not being overzealous and taking care not to remove legitimate requests Id have restored it but I see that youve already taken care of it I will try to be even more careful in the future crossposted to Benws talk page

Thanks again Брайен
