Newest vandalisms by Tajik as anon IP 

He persianises the article Timurid dynasty with thousands of lies and with exploiting the memory of the dead of the Armnenian genocide to discredit me suggesting me as a Turk to better discredit me with the Armenian genocide and let his version win via this kind of discrediting Shame on you Tajik You exploit this tragedy for your psychopathic wikipedia vandalisms He vandalises against sources like Thackston and Manz and Amitav Ghosh Additionally the meaning Timuriyan was not used by the Timurides themselves This is the current word with which someone calls the Timurides today in the streets of Teheran 
All these vandalisms did occur though he is blocked
