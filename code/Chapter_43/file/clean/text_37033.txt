Anti corporate activism 

Im not sure if this was your intention however some of the former members of the categories you attempted to subsume into anticorporate activism have been removed from the category and have since been homeless as far as categorization according to corporate scandal

While I believe you meant to make the name loose enough to include all of the articles under these categories many are interpreting the category to mean Anticorporate activists instead of mere issues targets and activists involved in corporate activism FYI

See TalkHalliburton for example
