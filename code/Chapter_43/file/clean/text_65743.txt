Alternative hip hop like all genres of art is a social construction and as such the definition is open to debate     

If with the term social construction in this sentance the statement Alternative hip hop like all genres of art is a social construction is meant to convey that any musical work one calls alternitive hip hop happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions as opposed to working in a vacuum or if it is meant to establish that the term alternative hip hop was created by such an agent then the statement is quite true  However a social construction typically is opposed to a natural kind in that it is only conventional  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true  take the art genres Oil Painting and Punk Rock  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different there is a matter of fact about it  However in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that as such the definition is open to debate  I do not mean to contend that the definition isnt open to debate but only that its openness to debate isnt tied in any direct way to whether it is a social contruction  In the first case consider the terms integer and one both terms where surely created by agents in a social setting yet their definitions are particularly rigorous  As for the second case i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish Jew in this sense is a social construction it is purely social convention and not a natural kind in any ordinary way  Nonetheless we already stipulated a perfectly rigourous definition            J
