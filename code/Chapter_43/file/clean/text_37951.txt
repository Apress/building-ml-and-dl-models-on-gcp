Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption
I have added a wellknown historic photo to this page of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city  Little is known of the origins of this photo certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home the surrender of his armed forces and the capitulation of his government  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France and certainly in occupied nonVichy France
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps  This was the caption provided by the photo source wwwarchivesgov and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia  The new caption adds in joy or sorrow  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo
I am open to other opinions about this photo if they can be sourced  The caption was changed without comment  I am reverting  Please discuss if you disagree
