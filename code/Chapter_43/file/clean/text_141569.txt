i totally disagree there is a clear argument for merging  she would never have her own wikipedia page had she died in a car accident  in other words without her husband she does not satisfy the notability requirement  i contend that there is no reason for these articles NOT to be merged look up any other murderer on WP the victims are part of the same article unless someone can give some strong nonemotional reason not to merge them ill go ahead and do it
