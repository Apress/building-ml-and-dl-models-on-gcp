better 

Id like to issue a public thank you to the Wikipedia community for their attention to this area  This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts  It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture

When I first started looking into this topic the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased  I still feel that objectively the definition should clearly state that most crossbreeds lead to a reduction in fitness  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as linebreeding but it is a wasteful effort  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool  99 of mutations are deleterious

Respect of natural selection should be the default position  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished what makes us different is what makes us special  By mixing the races in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution
