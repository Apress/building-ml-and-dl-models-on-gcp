St Andrews Church 

I removed the reference to St Andrews being the highest parish church in Worcestershire
because 1 it is not in Worcestershire but in the Diocese of Worcester and 2 St Thomas in Dudley also in the Diocese of Worcester is according to the Explorer OS map of the area at a greater height above sea level
