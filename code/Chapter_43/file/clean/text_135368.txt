Morocco versus History 
Acording to Le Petitte Larousse Morocco began in 1631 not before Its the same as UK its not only the history of England and what happens about Scotland

Since 1956 Morocco think they are sucessors of all arabic states in this part of Magreb but acording to EspasaCalpe 1917 the country was cold Imperio Jarifiano And if you see the kingdom order its differents and they are more differents and its NOT the same country Acording to  Euratlas Le petitte Larouse Junta de Andaluc√≠a EspasaCalpe its not the same country Morocco was part of this countries yes this is thrue but Morocco its a new kingdom

Acording to new Morrocan writers Morroco its the legal sucessor to Almoravides but I can found 9 more legal sucessor of Almoravides incluying Banu Ganyra and Almohades Later we can found Morocco as legal and only sucessor to Almohades but I can found more than  3 kingdoms sucessor not only Marinid
