Do not be pathetic I do not take antiPolish views and do not make antiPolish edits Unless of course you consider deleting Polish POV as making antiPolish edits Provide evidence if you believe it is not so Also I am by far not the only one to react to your behaviour here

You ask me about my nationality I will not tell you as I believe nationality does not matter on Wikipedia However contrary to you I am not at the same time 1 a self declared Czech when talking to editors with Czech ancestry 2 a European since the beginning of this calendar year and 3 a Pole whose grandfather was active in preparations of the Polish occupation of Zaolzie when talking to your fellow Polish editors

If you talk about your achievements why do you not mention that you were several times blocked once even by Jimbo Wales for personal attacks or incivility Why do you keep quiet about being desysoped because of bad behaviour in a dispute relating to ethnic issues

In relation to the latest edits in Cieszyn and Český Těšín the Austrian census of 1910 do you still believe there were no Czechs in town or did you not know at that time  It is not a POV pushing from my side I would do the same for the Czech minority if some would be here 

Do seriously think of your approach You have my sympathies in preserving Polish traditions and ethnicity in Teschen Silesia but I will keep on strongly opposing your POV insertions They do not belong here This is Wikipedia
