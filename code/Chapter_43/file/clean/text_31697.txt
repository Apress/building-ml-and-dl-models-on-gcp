We agree that there are human rights that do not appear in any law book treaty dictionary or even a USSC decision The founders of the US said this and wrote an expandible constitution The 14th Amendment reserved to Congress the authority to enumerate these This happened when Congress enumerated such rights with the Civil Rights Act of 1963 from the Republican Party and more recently with the Americans with Disabilities Act I expect that you will see some more enumerations by Congress The US Constitution is designed with the idea that as society progresses that human rights will continue to be enumerated I can remember when there was no right of privacy but Roe v Wade enumerated this right 

The problem we have here and now is that rights that you and I now believe should be enumerated have not yet been This means they cannot go into an encyclopedia until they too are enumerated
