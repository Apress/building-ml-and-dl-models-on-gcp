Ms Dynamite is not webcomic she is some stupid singer 
I am very disappointed in dolty Wikipedians who has no common sense to make a bad decision to redirect to Ms Dynamite when Miss Dynamite was mentioned in other articles as a webcomic If Wikipedian wont remove redirect then he will be stupid enough to be not smart Redirect command must be removed Ms Dynamite is not part of webcomic she is singer what dolt Wikipedians may be computer geeks but none of them have common sense that make them dumb
