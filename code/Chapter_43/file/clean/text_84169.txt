Benefits 

Can someone remove this section  It makes no sense 

Besides that its not really a benefit Ive never ever seen a situation where a gear was not positively located on the shaft Not saying it has never happened but this is not something anyone in real life would consider a benefit 

Someone who is not lazy could also add a section to explain the fact that true herringbones are only useful for pumps For power transmission testing has shown that doublehelicals with the gap in the middle deflect more evenly across the teeth and wear more evenly They are also important for submarine use quieter
