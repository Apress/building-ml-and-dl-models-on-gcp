Are The Simpsons responsible for the Guitar Hero name 

Im trying to find out where the games designers got the inspiration for the name Guitar Hero Does anyone know The reason I ask is because of the episode How I Spent My Strummer Vacation of The Simpsons aired in 2002 uses the phrase and given the proximity between the airing of that episode and the creationrelease of the first Guitar Hero game figured it couldnt hurt to ask
