Huggle request
I have been trying to figure out how to go over my drafts to check for copyright violations The Huggle tool looks promising but requires more time on the site and lots more edits to access Would you mind helping on my project by running the tool on the article in my sandbox and tell me how bad it is Thanks for your hlep in advance
