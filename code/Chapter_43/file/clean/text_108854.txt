Hi I noticed that youve been adding a lot of bradttravelguidescom links to key article countries and so on and at times even placing them above nations own official tourism websites  Can you account for this practice What can you tell me about the notability of that website Do you feel it qualifies under our external links guideline Finally do you have any realtion with the site or its founder Thank you in advance
