My contribution

I am a lawyer in London who for over 20 years was an active member of the Conservative Monday Club which actually had a Legal Policy Group as there were so many lawyers in the Club You know the sort of lawyers you sneer at so competantly I want you to know that I have finally written to Gregory LauderFrost and his Edinburgh solicitors offering my services gratis I have included several pages of your comments which we have managed to catalogue which demonstrate very clear malice and an absolute contempt of UK law which any judge would find hands down You clearly think you know better than the legal profession and that when people approach us for our advice or instruct us that we give them worthless service I suggest you think again Scum like you do abound as is evidenced here and on at least three other sites to which you contribute your venom Youve certainly learned nothing from the internet libel judegment against your friend William I suggest that you will have an attachment of earnings order to your salary until your are in middle age after this is over
