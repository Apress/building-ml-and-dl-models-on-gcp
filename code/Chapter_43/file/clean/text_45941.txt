R1b1c 
The R1b1c in Sardinia is M18 a clade that is absent in all subSaharan and other African populations It was only detected in Lebanon Sardinia and Corsica Its ancestral clade is V88 and V88 clades are most common in subsaharn Africa but R1bV88 itself is not subsaharan due to its ancestor P25 ancestor of both V88 and M269 is not subSaharan African but from the Eastern Eurasia where in turn its ultimate ancestor M207 R1bR1a derives from Thus before R1b P25V88 entered subSahran Africa from EurasiaNearEast it must have split into subclade M18 and moved along the Mediterranean as for the distribution of V88 clades in subSahran Africa Cruciani et al 2010 In summary our data indicate a significant male contribution from northern Africa and ultimately Asia to the gene pool of the central Sahel The transSaharan population movements resulting in this genetic pattern would seem to mirror the spread of the protoChadic languages and most likely took place during the early mid Holocene a period when giant paleolakes may have provided a corridor for human migrations across what is now the Sahara desertCruciani et al 2010 httpwwwnaturecomejhgjournalv18n7fullejhg2009231ahtml note the complete absence of M18 in Africa Table1
