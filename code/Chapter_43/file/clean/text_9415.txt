Language and Mindset of a Popular 1950s Musical

Some parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956 Crosbys character sings a love song to an elevenyearold girl his exwifes younger sister who still has quite a crush on him  the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughters body while upbraiding her for having no compassion as most characters in the movie have already or soon will  and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex separated from the moviegoing masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class When Tracy Lord played by Kelly awakens hungover on her wedding day she doesnt at first remember anything about her previous nights drunken carousing but comes to believe she made love with Mike the reporter played by Sinatra and discusses it at length with her exhusband Dexter played by Crosby At the time of course making love was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense Being a romantic comedy High Society plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel

There are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie as Kittridge the upandcoming coal magnate and fiance to the current mine owners daughter is described as having worked his way up from being a miner and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class as is Sinatras journalist character
