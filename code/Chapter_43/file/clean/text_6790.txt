Good Information  Going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible should we then create a different article for the Gong Baotian and Xie Pieqi styles  Rather than dilute the style information of each style my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm  Perhaps one called Xie Pieqi Line Yin Style Baguazhang and another Gong Baotian Line Yin Style Baguazhang  For each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources splits from the main article seem to make sense to me
