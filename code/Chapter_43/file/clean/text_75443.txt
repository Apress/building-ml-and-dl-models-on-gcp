It appears to vary depending on the Girl Scouts organization selling them I just removed this small paragraph

As part of the change in organizational structure in August 2006 this variation was ended and all troops now sell cookies at the same time in the early months of each year and at the same price 4 per box httpwwwgirlscoutsnorcalorgpagesproduct_salescookie_salehtml

The linked page httpwwwgirlscoutsnorcalorgpagesproduct_salescookie_salehtml doesnt say anything about a national pricing policy just what the price is from Girl Scouts of Northern California And the price there is 400 whereas my daughters scout troop in Philadelphia are selling them for 350
