Personally I am shocked that this sort of statement would ever be appropriate for a Wikipedia article Talk page and if ever there was an appropriate moment for it to be statement would be for the private grievance process that any organization of value would recognize and have previously established if a need have developed Anyone that would feel comfortable dealing in this particular way I would hope would realize their misjudgment This type od action poisons minds and unsettles people that are in a setting that is of a making not of their own Now as for what you said I notice youre not interested in the substance here Your personal attacks are out of order Why on earth would anyone say such a conceited and probably selfserving statement especially when that seems to be in reply to someone cautioning you about what you say of others who replied to your reasoning of an issue and were not swayed Not only that but that YOU felt compelled not to rest your argument for an issue on your own efforts but to bring in others to whom YOU showed their work and seemed more than happy to return an unfavorable review

If I were charged with building support for an issue and wanted that effort thought on the reasons I presented then I certainly would not say that your work is no good because others have told me What makes you think that what others not in the process of that deliberation trump the work of others Was this brought on because someone was so forthcoming in an attempt to check your ulterior motives with the statement Any nullification sourcing from you provides much more indication of what value it holds Especially when that same person says I am not here to actively make enemies and disrupt others All I can say is that I reiterate my statement and that to yours Take on a world with no problems you take on problems and stand alone

You are a trouble maker And probably a sour sport If any one is not interested in the efforts of Wikipedia is would appear just by your effort in this one section by itself You can cry wolf only so many times before irritation precedes you You just may have shown your true colors Am I to encounter this type of motive in every article in Wikipedia or are your type in the single numbers and far and few between Can anyone else speak to this How should it be reported to the Amins at Wiki for at least review and potential resolution
