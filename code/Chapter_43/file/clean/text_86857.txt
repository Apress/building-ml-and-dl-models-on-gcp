Another favored technique of lobbyists is the doctoring of Wikipedia a site that is widely loathed in the industry for its phenomenal reach and for the fact that a tiny community of editors is able to decide whether a corporation has a controversies section on their wiki or not A ridiculous organization created by a bunch of nerds is Tim Bells take on the site Accounts associated with Bell Pottinger were caught scrubbing the profiles of among many others the arms manufacturer and client the Paramount Group at least two large financial firms and the founder of libel specialists CarterRuck

Its important for Wikipedia to recognize we are a valuable source for accurate information Bell told PR Week This someone whose company has famously spun the reputations of dictators repressive governments polluting oil firms and arms companies facing bribery chargesit even won a contract from the USsupported government in Iraq to promote the concept of democracy

Ive seen this in action on living politicians  for example a statement of fact that they are employing their spouse on public money being censored out

To the point in hand there is ample and remarkable coverage of this man being most hated in respectable printed newspapers  so put a paragraph on this phenomenatheres actually a refusal to claim he was criticized on social media on this talk page even though a presidential candidate h Clinton posted on twitter in relation to itactually rejecting that social media reacted to this individuals actions as it demonstrably did No room for truth or reality on Wikipedia when it comes to living corporate figures or politicians  even when the material is making news headlines

Internet PR  scum of the earth IF they had been around in 1944 theyd have taken money from Hitler to groom his Wikipedia entry and editors would have surprisingly gone along with it
