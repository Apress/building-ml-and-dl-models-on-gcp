Kurds are not Iranian 

Kurdish people are not Iranians Just because there is a possiblity that the Medians were ancestors of the Kurds does not in any way make the Kurds Iranian Just because Kurdish is a bit similar to languages like Persian does not make Kurds Iranian Kurdish people are descendants of many different people that inhabitated Kurdistan such as Hurrians Gutians Mittani Cordune and much more Kurds are not Iranian people I have many many reliable scholarly sources on the Kurds and it does not mention anything about being Iranian Kurds have their own histroy and are a distinct people The term Iranian in itself is wrong to describe Today the term is used to describe a person who lives or is from Iran Therefore many people will be heavily confused when they see this term Not only that but like I said Kurds are not Iranian in the first place I have many sources to back it up and I dont know why Wikipedia allowed such false information to be posted up 

I am not denying that the Kurdish lanugage can be described as a lanugage that is part of the Indo European family of Northwestern Iraninan languages but to say that the Kurds themselves are Iranian is completley false Kurds have a long history in the Middle East and were even mentioned by the Sumerians Kurds are descendants of many different people and there is not only historical evidence to back that up but genetic evidence as well Dont think so Then go search for yourself
