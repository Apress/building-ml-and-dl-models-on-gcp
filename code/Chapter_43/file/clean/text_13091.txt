OK sorry for the delay in responding properly  From what I can tell the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of LDSrelated articles and those edits were reverted by various editors myself included  Now there are two main ways of viewing these facts one that your edits were consistent with Wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so two that your edits were not consistent with Wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them  This is why I asked you about your understanding of Wikipedia policy  you are relatively new here and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines  Its natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes so it doesnt imply any malice on your part  Since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and I regard your edits in light of WP policy it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree  It would be helpful though to know that youve indeed read the pertinent policies so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas  Have you done this  Thanks  talk
