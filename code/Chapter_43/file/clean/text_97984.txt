Because it is Talbot herself who revises the existing Narrative of why the Nayaks fought the Delhi sultans and how they liberated the Andhra region PR Rao doesnt need to reject Talbots revisionism because he merely states the existing narrative that Nayaks fought to liberate their own country from Turk muslims It is Talbot  Eaton who come up with the theory that the Nayaks had revised their own history as if they needed to in order to liberate their own country from foreigners Had you read carefully you would have seen above where I say that Rao himself predates Talbot If you wanted page numbers for anything let alone that odd request of an older source needing to explicitly reject a new theory then you and your friend should have simply asked like adults with civility 
 When I have received even an opinion on the merits to my proposal above then we can continue this interaction since you both have been making bad faith edits without consensus and have now reverted my own edit I didnt even ask for much just According to Talbot and Eaton and even that was reverted Why such stubbornness You dont own these pages nor are you the review panelI sense another reason for such behavior given our previous interaction yet another reason for your appearance here Be advised that Wikipedia is for good faith editors who want to improve the content not for bad faith editors who have a vendetta against someone for a sockpuppet investigation And tell your friends to stop issuing threats on my talk page 

Either way I responded now to make myself clear But since you clearly dont have the understanding of the subject matter rather than waste everyones time you should just let your friend do the edits and lead the discussion assuming even he is interested in that and you can just go back to helping him circumvent 3RR when he needs you to It will save time that way and avoid the bitternness and acrimony you felt in your previous comment which you later removed
