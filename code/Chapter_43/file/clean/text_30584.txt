Timeshifters dishonesty 

Timeshifter your story above is textbook projection first rate watermuddying I grant you but deceit nonetheless But this follows the pattern of your edits Your POV is clear throughout Its pretty simple you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth and therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate ILCS is not legitimate etc Basically every edit youve made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs Now youre pissed that Ive ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POVpushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it and now youre playing the victim 

Lets put that act aside and look at what Ive actually deleted Ive reverted basically three things here 

1 Lancet page  claims about a supposed ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages I deleted that fabrication The only sourced material I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing Once the fabricated ILCS baseline rate is removed the surrounding sourced material from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication The sourced material that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there so I removed it along with the fabrication 

2 IBC page  I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something and provided a citation for this Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC and he puts a footnote onto this but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely Thus this claim of Timeshifters is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else and the citation leads to something that is different than how its described 

So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications Apparently its against the rules and POVfavoring to delete POVpushing falsehoods and fabrications

3 IBC page  Guatemala study Ive questioned the relevance of this to IBC and the accuracy of the description and discussed this on the talk page This one is at least more debatable than the others as it is just tangential cherrypicking for a POV rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV

Deleting these three things has been my great crime causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish yeah right As Ive already said I cant keep up with Timeshifters proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages Hes very commited to the cause as proselytizers tend to be
