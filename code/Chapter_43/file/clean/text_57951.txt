This IP is shared by about two three hundred university students and as such does not have a singular guiding force behind it Also considering we are all students about 90 of the people behind this IP are complete idiots prone to making hilarious edits especially on a Friday or Saturday night after thee hours of concentrated binge drinking Id apologise on behalf of them but theyre seriously not worth the wasted effort I am sorry people have to chase after them and clean up their mess however seeing how their more physical mess is apparent to the hapless sods like myself who are actually intent on not wasting their time at university
