I would say get rid of the footnote  If one can hum the subject andor countersubject of the fugue thats pretty much the essence of it  What you are both saying is pedantic and suggests that I cant hum or rock or pop song because I cant hum the drums or guitar at the same time  The tune of a fugue is the subject
