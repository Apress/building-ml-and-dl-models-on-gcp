I think that KintetsubuffaloChris has a good point when he says that the article reads more like a family genealogy but I dont think that the solution is to trim out the less notable people   On the contrary they have a place in the story of the family but the significance of their role intends up being uninentionally overstated by the articles structure
The genealogy is clearly an important part of the article but I suggest that it should be at the bottom of the article in the place where an appendix would be in a book What the article needs I suggest is a clear narrative  telling of the story of the familys activities That could be done either thematically eg politics medicine industry or chronologically or maybe by a combination of both approaches
Vernon has clearly done a lot of excellent research and has plenty of useful material with which to tell the story here and I would really enjoy reading the story once its written up  I have been looking for a few articles which might serve as examples of how this might be done and found a few which might help
Rothschild banking family of England the best I found
Bulmer family a much weaker article but it tells a story
Mitford family narrative a bit short but heading in the right direction
German sisters more integrated than the Mitfords
Smalbroke family chronologially ordered and somewhat genealogical in focus but does tell a story
Hope this helps But in the meantime I have removed the notability tag because notability doesnt actually seem to be in question  talk  contribs
