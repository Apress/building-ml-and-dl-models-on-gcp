Definition for the list 

In light of the above discussions and the fact that the list is too inclusive to be useful or unbiased I propose that a very narrow definition of terrorism be used for this list I think Garz√≥ns definition is good for this purpose and should be applied to territories where the state in question has control The current list includes a lot of cases that can be subcategorized in other ways such as international terrorism including statesponsored international terrorism War Crimes and Human Rights Violations Perhaps there could be one list that uses a narrow definition of state terrorism followed by the more general list Thats just my suggestion I actually dont have the expertise on this topic get deeply involved in this  2113 21 Apr 2005 UTC
