External link to tariff data
Hello everyone I am working for the International Trade Centre ITC a UNWTO agency that aims to promote sustainable economic development through trade promotion I would like to propose the addition of an external link httpwwwmacmaporgQuickSearchFindTariffFindTariffaspxsubsiteopen_accesscountrySCC8627cVenezuelasource1ITC that leads directly to our online database of customs tariffs applied by Venezuela Visitors can easily look up market access information for Venezuela by selecting the product and partner of their interest I would like you to consider this link under the WPELYES 3 prescriptions Moreover the reliability and the pertinence of this link can be supported by the following facts 
1 ITC is part of the United Nations and aims to share trade and market access data on by country and product as a global public good
2 No registration is required to access this information
3 Market access data Tariffs and nontariff measures are regularly updated

Thank you
