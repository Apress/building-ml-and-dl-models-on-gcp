No admissions made nor is this anything ridiculous never mind your opinion Like I said you just want your opinionated version everywhere please spare at least the talk page And if you are talking about being lame you for yourself added a citation tag to my comment herethis is a talk page ffs how lamer can you get

The Girvaaurus were the first people to discover Maldives and they sailed from the Malabar Coast which constituted erstwhile Tamilakam back in the old times And the Maldives like many of the island territories in the Indian Ocean was under Chola rule for a brief period and hence is mentioned in one of their Chronicles Its a pity your knowledge relevent to Maldiveds is so limited and yet you can actively spend time in searching out an ebook and check out how many Tamil and Malayalam words exist in them Whatever goodwill and constructiveness are you talking about I cannot comprehend

ClarificationsII

Iam totally unable to comprehend all that you have flooded into here but Ill try to answer them all in a brief possible manner unlike you who only seem interested in diverting and escalating everything

Chiefly the content here talks of Maldives being a translation of Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit and Mahiladiva in Sinhala It only says MAY HAVE DERIVED and not that it had been derived likeyour POV claimsSo since Iam not convinced of this fact nor can you convince me why dont you simply blank the section and I might as well keep mum and go away as well 

Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit translates into Garland of Flowers which in turn in Tamil becomes MalaiThivu So the list is not only giving a translation of plainly the term Maldives into Tamil but rather supports the claim that மலததவ which means Garland of flowersthe google translates is as not maldivesif it was only a name translation was used to refer to the island

I had already acceptedand told this too that the first source bore no significance But I never used it to clarify the content that was there it is OBVIOUS Iam using the third source and you are just making it seem you were ignorant or too stupid to scroll down and verify You were well aware and there is no use pretending talk  contr  mail
