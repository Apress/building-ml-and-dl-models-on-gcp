Shamir to Diderot alias Moshe alias etc etc
Please note
1 you are too emotionally involved with Jewish subjects and in the interests of Wikipedia you should stay away from this article as well as from others on this theme 
2 You and your alter egos with various names did the same amount of reverts
3 Do you claim there are different sets of rules for philosemites and for the rest
4 I wonder why do you insist for instance to keep me in a different church
