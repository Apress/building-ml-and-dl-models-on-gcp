UserSuitcivil133 

Hi Walter I see that UserSuitcivil133 is starting to be a conflict with my edits judging from my opinion he is a Barcelona supporter and any negative out look of the team he deletes as in the Real Madrid vs Barcelona 111 Ive done my fair share of research and its been noted that there was no proof that Francisco Franco theatend Barcelona he also said that Your description of the 111 game is also highly biased I dont see how that was biased if that really happend Can you please do something because I dont want to be in an edit war with someone that reverts my contributions Then whats the whole point of updating the article
