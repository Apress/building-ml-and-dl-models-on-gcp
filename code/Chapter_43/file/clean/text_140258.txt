Regular Force
Regular Force is the templates name given to the link to the basic article Australian Army which is misleading as the article as it should gives an overview of both Regular Army and Army Reserve elements  

If some regular member is keen to create an article specifically on the ARA excluding the reserve elements in addition to the overall Australian Army that would be good   Linking the entire army under a reg only link is inappropriate
