Advice on PortalJurassic Park 

Hi Firs I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal I checked it out  saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others Firstly none of the pictures on the portal all of which are fair use have fair use rationale I expressed this to the user UserCuddly Panda who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply On closer inspection it seems the user has been uploading  adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now possibly upwards of a year  despite numerous warning from automated bots etc has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements Just check out the users talk page  nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads In addition to this the portal is very poor in quality unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections some of which have already been nominated for deletion So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next Theres a few options

1 Obviously the user is not listening to warnings  my messages so could I possibly bring this up at the administrators noticeboard They could then decide what to do next
2 Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of no opinion This would see what other editors think of the portal  even if it is kept the portals fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion
3 Ill probably do this anyway but the user is on Editor Review  I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong  how to remedy this

So Id personally like to do all three but if you can think of something else  help me decide which of those if any to carry out it would be appreciated Ill post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well Cheers
