Sorry for not formatting this and doing it wrong Im a little pressed for time right now and just want to thrown in my 2 cents There is an inconstancy in the logic used by  The New Age Retro Hippie  He states that Being addicted to WoW is different than addiction to a different brand of alcohol  the brand isnt exponentially different from any other brand Its roughly as addictive same concept same results So that means if 40 of people who drink are alcoholics just made that up to make my point and 80 who drink alcohol drink Budweiser it is not significant that 40 of people who drink Budweiser are alcoholics or in other words you cant say Budweiser is more addictive even though the majority of alcoholics will drink budwiesder  But then he goes and says that because 40 of people who play wow may be addicted or are addicted if prof opinion  fact WoW is more addictive then other games without knowing what the base rate of gaming addiction is or the proportion of gamers who play wow  It doesnt add up  Also if anyone wants to edit this and move it to make the convo flow better please feel free to do so
