Indeed youre right Whats so frustrating about English is that if you are not a native speaker or at least learend it at very young age you will get hard time to get to closer level with native speaker of English It may be much easier for people whose native tongue is German Dutch some Scandinavian languages except for Finnish and etcbut for me at the least its not come naturaly but I must say that during the last years I didnt have many opportunities to practice it extensively The English vocabulary is huge not once there are 100 different words for the very same object with most cases its unnecessary probably its related to the expansions of the British empire I realy think that German and English are among the hardest languges to take control of Spanise on the other hand is very friendly
