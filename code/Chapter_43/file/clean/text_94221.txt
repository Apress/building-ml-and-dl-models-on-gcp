Personally I agree with what was said by Ilike2beanonymous
I removed the fluffnonsense about resonance which has little if anything to do with how a soundboard works Resonance is a specific aspect of sound mechanics which has to do with the frequency of maximum amplitude of a system What happens with a soundboard is actually much simpler it has a larger surface area than a string alone and therefore can move a larger volume of air hence a higher volume of sound ILike2BeAnonymous 

The term amplify is definitely true when it comes to the soundboard Im currently studying to become a pianotechnician myself and I would be very interested to hear your professionel explanation for saying that the soundboard does not amplify anything As far as I know the word amplify has been used for a lot of nonelectrical things for a long time now so I dont really see your point there either
Care to elaborate
