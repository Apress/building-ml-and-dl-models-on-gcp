For the record here is the edit in question Although the statement made by Onorem is uncivil it is hard to disagree with it and it certainly is not a personal attack The very policy  cited suggests that him deleting that post was controversial at best and the fact that he  did it without any consensus that it constituted a personal attack twice ot to mention his absurd accusation that I had made a personal attack just by restoring that comment leaves much to be desired
