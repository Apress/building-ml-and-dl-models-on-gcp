Avraham Aharon Price 

Hi I noticed that you tagged Avraham Aharon Price as a CSD A7 thanks for your contribution  However an assertion is made of Prices notability namely Canadas most influential rabbinic figures  This may not be true and certainly this allegation is unsourced but it is a claim of notability  If you still think the article should be deleted please feel free to  or tag it for AfD  Thanks again   Talk
