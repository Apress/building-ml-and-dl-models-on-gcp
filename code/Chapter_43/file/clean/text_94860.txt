From the article

In September 2007 Rolling Stone Japan rated their album Warning from Stardust at No 23 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time

Untrue

This is the front cover of the September 2007 edition of Rolling Stone Japan which would have come out in August or conceivably even July of 2007 Its the best reproduction Ive found of the cover Google image search may turn up a superior alternative Unsurprisingly as its a Japaneselanguage magazine it shows no article titled 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time It does however show an article whose title might reasonably be so translated Furthermore Japanese magazines love decorative snippets of English and its conceivable that the actual article which I havent seen is decorated with this or another English title

The web page that this article cites for the claim that In September 2007 Rolling Stone Japan rated etc etc actually tells its readers that

The 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time have been chosen by Rolling Stone Japan Well theyve been chosen by RS contributing editor Kawasaki Daisuke who also founded the very stylish pop musicfashiondesign mag Beikoku Ongaku so the list could very well be worthwhile

Rolling Stone Japan is linked to its web page Beikoku Ongaku literally America music with a jokily oldfashioned term for America is linked to beikokuongakucom an anonymously run domain name running a website for some collagen drink  put out by an unnamed company

So the source says that the records have been chosen by one person Kawasaki Daisuke or Daisuke Kawasaki as enWP would insist on writing his name

Further theres no hint on the cover of the magazine that the magazine is presenting the list as its list Instead its just one article and its presented as the third attraction of the month below a multipart feature on rock and ecology and also below something about Bob Dylan

What kind of list is this The small print on the magazine cover is too small for me to make out But I showed it to Mrs Hoary a native speaker of Japanese and without any prompting from me she said that it almost certainly says 独断と偏見で選んだ This means that its a personal opinionated choice

Theres nothing inherently wrong with personal opinionated choices Id take the personal opinionated choices of Pauline Kael over the collective wisdom of the various august bodies that showered awards over Forrest Gump But Id take them because shes Pauline Kael not because the choices are opinionated If Kawasaki is a noteworthy critic then the listing  of course described as by Kawasaki not as by Rolling Stone Japan  should be mentioned

I know next to nothing about Japanese rock music criticism But Daisuke Kawasaki doesnt have an article in enWP Hes not mentioned in the jaWP article on Rolling Stone And I dont think he gets an article in jaWP certainly when I look for 川 or 河 in the list of articles in jaWP that list to the jaWP article on Rolling Stone I see nothing

Of course plenty of noteworthy people never get articles at either enWP or jaWP But without some indication of Kawasakis noteworthiness it seems odd for something like this  even if it were labeled as Kawasakis opinion and not the opinion of Rolling Stone Japan  to appear in the lead of an article
