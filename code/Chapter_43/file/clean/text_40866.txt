Huh
You seem to have a strong POV against the CIAin any case shouldnt readers be allowed to decide for themselves
It does
Whats the difference
Facts are not POV  The fact of the matter is the NLG supported a highly antiAmerican and antiIsraeli document  Take that as you like
So youre saying that the facts make you think the NLG supports terrorism  Not my problem
I disagree
Ok open borders lobby
Im not sure if anyone who is complaning about a CIA hackjob should be an editor  Its especially laughable as if you had bothered to look into my userpage Im an anarchocapitalist not exactly CIA material
