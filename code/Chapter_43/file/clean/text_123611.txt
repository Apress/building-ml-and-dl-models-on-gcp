Fine to see things settled 

Im relatively a new user and for that reason maybe I did some mistakes handling this dispute In that manner Im sorry if I made some personal attacks on FSF or if I was to fast and responded not courteously in some cases  However everything I did was done in order to have more appropriate article that will thoroughly describe Kumanovo
As I can see the page is unprotected now and FSF returned the most of my new additions to the page and Im thankful for that For now Im not going to make any corrections on the current text and I will leave FSF to do it if he feels the necessity for that in order to finally shape the appropriate look of the article  I would like to propose to FSF several minor changes on the current version which I think should be done in order to achieve further improvement of the article
 1 I think the following geographical info should be moved from the Economy into the Overview section Although Kumanovo lies 340 kilometers above the sea it is surrounded by the Karadag part of Skopska Crna Gora mountain on its western side Gradishtanska planina mountain on its southern side and Mangovica and German mountain on the eastern side Kumanovo has a temperate climate
 2 I still have doubt about the presence of private practice Otodent in the Culture section
 3 By my opinion the last three sentences in the Culture section would be more appropriate in the History section
Thanks
