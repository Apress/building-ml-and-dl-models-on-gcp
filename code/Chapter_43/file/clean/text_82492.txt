Tila Nguyen
Hello

I see youve deleted Tila Nguyen from CategoryPorn stars and List of heterosexual erotic actresses  I know Tila does mostly softcore work but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress even if not completely a porn star   0422 20 Sep 2004 UTC

 Cuyamaca 

I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca California I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two Im inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city town or village and the likenamed region in which they sit If so in your opinion should the articles be consolidated under Cuyamaca or Cuyamaca California  1758 27 Sep 2004 UTC

I couldnt find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion I assume that all the other particulars such as the duplicate article page will be taken care of  0051 28 Sep 2004 UTC

thanks for the edits of my pages Im often vague and I forget formatting ps how do you do that neat thing where you make you name ant the time you commented appear after posting a talk thing

 Northern vs Southern California speech 

In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters Of course it would be helpful if you could provide other examples but the one you cited would be a good start too  2019 Nov 7 2004 UTC

 Confirmation 

Jeff are you sure that her surname is Lee In the English context evidence is provided that she is Lee Sung Hi or Sung HiLee which says that Sung is her surname However using Hangul or HanjaHanzi to search her surname is Lee You may be correct but try searching using these methods that I stated Thanks UserChan Han Xiang

 Re Current Events death of Iris Chang 

I put the mention of her death back into the current events section that you removed  Yes there is a list of deaths on the right but it does not contain links to outside news articles  Also note that Yasser Arafats death is listed in the main section of the page even though he is listed in the deaths section  If you have any commentsquestions please reply to my talk page   0436 12 Nov 2004 UTC

 I removed the notice of her death and not Arafats because Arafat was a major politician who played an enormous role in his part of the world and Ms Chang is a noted pophistorian I though
