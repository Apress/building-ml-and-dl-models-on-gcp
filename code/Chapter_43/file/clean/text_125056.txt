I understand your logic but I disagreed with your position for a different reason  The point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view  If we are to assume good faith here we should believe they did actually see the full texts cited them and provided the links to google books as the best available online target its better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all wouldnt you agree  However this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these citeswhat it does mean is that to be able to question them youll have to have something better than logicallyenhanced mind wanderings such as one above  Which brings me back to my original recommendationfind the books read them and if they indeed are not acceptable as references remove the sentences in question  If in turn anyone questions the results of your analysis well theyll have to get their own copy of the books on their own after which you can go through the pleasure of discussing both sides interpretations of the sources on the articles talk page instead of accusing the other party of what may or may not have been the case of ORSYNplain negligence to do a proper research  yo 1731 March 30 2009 UTC
