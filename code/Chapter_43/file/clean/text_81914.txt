Perhaps a refresher is needed
Im noting a number of citaitons appearing in the lead that simply shouldnt be there by design As per Lead the first few paragraphs of the article are supposed to be an overview of the article and not introduce new information to the article which is specifically what is happening when there are citations in the Lead I would suggest that a reevaluation of the Lead take place to make sure it is acutally representing the article body Those new bits of information currently in the Lead  with citations should be incorporated into the article   cast a spell
