Hughes prize lacks reference 

I did a quick search and I could not find any reference to a Hughes Prize of the American Physics Society The professional organization of physicists is called American PHYSICAL Society There appears to be a Hughes Medal but it is given by the Royal Society

The mention of Chews prize comes with no reference although it follows the wording on his official faculty page at UC Berkeley which may also be wrong
