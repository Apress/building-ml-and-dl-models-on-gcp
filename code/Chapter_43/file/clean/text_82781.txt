Hey I send that comment to TalkMacedonian Slavs and I was just about to reply to you and to  when I suddenly went offline As for your request for clearing out your name I really dont know how to help I mean you are obviously in some quarrel with REX I really dont know how to help there  you should probably both stop it regardless whos started it and try to find a solution according to the NPOV policy I have already stated my POV on the Arvanites dispute  I might be wrong but it is probably better for me to stay away from the dispute I think that REXs current version is quite OK It includes what the vast majority linguists say Arvanitika is a variety of Tosk Albanian and Arvanites sensitivity towards the problem Most Arvanites strongly dislike being called Albanians I mean its not like saying that Arvanites are ethnic Albanians For example I cannot dispute the fact that most sources in the past referred to the Macedonian language as a Bulgarian or a Serbian dialect despite the fact that I believe that they were seriously wrong and therefore there is nothing wrong with this sentence Most sources in the past regarded Macedonian as a subset of the Bulgarian and Serbian language

As for the block I think that youre taking it too seriously I havent been blocked but I have been ignored several times by some admins although Ive specifically requested not to be ignored they could have at least said that I dont want to get involved or smtg like that My POV is that all the three blocks were somekind of a mistake in the formal sense I guess  acted in good faith but chose the wrong means to convince you guys to finally stop PAs I also think that  misunderstood REXs actions as well but he manages to live on  That of course is only my POV But it is a fact that admins are humans as well

As for the RfC I dont see any particular reason to believe that neutrals will get involved in it all of the sudden If they do great But if they dont we cannot wait indefinitely After all Mediation isnt such a big deal Regards
