Your last edit in Haji Baktash Wali is OK Lets hope that the other guy does not mess it up again As for List of Turkic states and empires

Safavids were NOT a Turkic state We had this discussion one year ago and none of the leading scholarly sources support this view Whats seems to be true is that many important members of the family spoke Turkish as their native tongue including most of the Shahs not all of them the Safavids were mixed with all kinds of other royal families 
The Ottoman Turks were deffinitly Persianate Turkic  in fact they are one of the best examples for the deffinition of the word Persianate
