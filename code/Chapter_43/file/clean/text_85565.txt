Reverting my edit for no reason was very rude  Repeatedly deleting my posts asking you why you did that without having the courtesy to answer me is extremely rude  Accusing me of being impolite while deleting my question is extremely rude  Behaviour like yours is extremely damaging to the encyclopaedia  Why not just answer the question  Do you regard it as your right to revert for no reason or something  20083101199
