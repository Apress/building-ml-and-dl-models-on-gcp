Merger proposal 

I propose that Murray2 Hydroelectric Power Station be merged into Murray1 Hydroelectric Power Station I think that the content in the Murray 2 article can easily be explained in the context of Murray 1 article by adding a separate section and the Murray 1 article is of a reasonable size in which the merging of Murray 2 will not cause any problems as far as article size or undue weight is concerned  The precedent for the proposed merger is already established for the three power stations at Tumut
