Strong disagree Alpha means that one of the first things you see in the lists is ANS one of the least notable servers It makes it unnecessarily hard to compare Microsoft to BIND and BIND to djbdns which are the two most important comparisons to be drawn out from the table Alpha seems like the choice youd make if you were conceding not to know how important the different servers are But we do know
 Candidly I cant see how coverage of say Posadis and MaraDNS can be justified if the list is alpha it means that each server we add potentially hurts the quality and utility of the article I know Im thinking about this too much
