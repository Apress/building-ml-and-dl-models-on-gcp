And there is your main problem Your edited a page for a band you dont now a thing about Its would be like me edited a the page about Jazz music or Kenny G I dont know a thing about it and I dont care how many reliable sources I have how do I check to know they are even telling the truth if I dont even listen to Jazz or Kenny G who plays Smooth jazz I leave it to people who know about that music and know about Kenny G 

Another example I have never watched The OC but should I edit it to say its a scifi show just because some reliable sources says it is Thats giving false info on something I dont know a thing about I do know about One Tree Hill TV series and I will edit out  any one that would try to list it as a scifi show even if a reliable sources wants to say other wise Why because ever one who has watched the show knows its a Teen Drama and ever one agrees on that 

Your a bands whole page when you dont even listen to the band and only know what someone else told you about them I watch One Tree Hill I have all four senses on DVD I know a lot about the show I can edit it because I know what Im talking about I cant do the same with The OC Jazz music or the page about Kenney G no matter what reliable sources because I have know why of knowing if those sources are stating facts about the subject at hand

Its like starting a page that about how 224 and then someone else coming a long and saying that MSNBC says that 221 Well seeing as how all the math books math teachers you and I says other wise MSNBC would be wrong
