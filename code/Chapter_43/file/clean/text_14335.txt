I offer the edits of Fnlayson as proof if you check the history Ive never reverted any of his changes as he always impoves on my text and when I wanted to change the article name to Lockheed A12 Oxcart he disagreed along with another wiki user and the matter was settled in their favour Thats not the behaiviour of someone who owns articles I resent being labeled a wiki nazi
