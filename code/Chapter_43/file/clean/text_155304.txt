Your edit to List_of_Sigma_Nu_brothersGovernment for Neal Katyal listed a reference that did not include him as a Brother of Sigma Nu I added a Citation needed tag but did not remove him from the list as he is a brother in the Sigma Nu database but we cannot use that DB as it is private Please find a public source that meets WPVERIFY and remove the tag

Thanks for your contributions
