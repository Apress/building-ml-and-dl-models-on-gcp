Redlinks 

Allow me to outline a scenario On an article about a TV program there is a redlink to an actor who appeared in a oneline role and were know as Taxi Driver 2 The article is created but as they have only ever appeared in one episode of a TV program where there part consisted of six words the article is tagged with a CSD A7 another user removes the tag the article is PRODed on day 65 the PROD is removed the article goes to AfD then five days later id deleted because the actor fails the GNG and WPACTOR the link turns red again I would argue that Marshalls brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM The director of Zombieland deserves an article Boy 1 in episode 9 of season 5 of HIMYM does not Red links are useful but redlinks everywhere do not help On a related topic using the FA 30 Rock season 1 as the template I have started  feel free to edit
