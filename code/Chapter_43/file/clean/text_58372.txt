Solution 

This is save Venice and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution I have no intention in keeping it nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages After this statement I will be closing it and just be Save venice This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal how stupid

Now If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight here is a solution step by step

1 I have looked into all of your backgrounds and none of you are Venetain experts please stick with what you know and dont muck up good articles Most of you are only interested in hoaxes and seem you to enjoy talking about them Stop doing that it is not a solution 

2 Having also looked into the background of this situation  it is clear where the hoax is coming from Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois Vitus must have went there and these kids knew him or knew of him they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society and the hoax is then neutralized 

3 Go to the Fenwick HS talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file so it is there but out of the way it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes

4 go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed

5 If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page

6 If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc It should be fair game to be removed They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes 

7 I have also looked over the previous page you sent me and the knowledge on that was also good Spretti goes into detail about the familys Roman roots etc It can be referenced but I am not going to reference other peoples work return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top It is a good overview of the family and it is enough if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves

8 Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links and I will work closely with our expert on that there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro Also red links show where further development needs to occur there may be other people out there that has info too Red links are useful If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links but leave them there there are useful to direct development

9 Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with 

10 Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above

11 My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice My focus is not just on the Barbaro family I am happy to fix it and then move on

RELATED ISSUES

1 I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem nor do I believe that that even occured I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this at Fenwick HS and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some Expert to fix a Wikipedia article 

2 I am NOT misguided I know this familys history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads You will also find more info out there about Antonios line because in Malta titles are still holding political power while in Vituscase they are cultural titles devoid of powers 

3 Finally Antonios branch is 100 the same family from Venice Spretti p277 Ramo di questa famiglia fiori
