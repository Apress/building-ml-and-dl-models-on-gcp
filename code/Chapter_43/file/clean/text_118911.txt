Unless you have newer statistics those still apply and are valid unless there is some scientific timelimit Im not aware of when something becomes irrelevant Is it 5 years or 10 15 You can always neutralize the sentence by adding according to the 1985 survey And it is very much relevant to mention that Russian and Chinese physical anthropologists largely disagree with the opinions of American and Canadian anthropologists because America is not the center of the world and neither is it the authority on race The original current sentence lacks neutrality and is giving all the weight on the side of American anthropologists this even though every single source explicitly says there is no consensus The neutrality issue will be solved once both opinions are expressed I did my best and wrote two what I believe are neutral texts to replace the current one but you disagree with both of them So you propose one Im going to bed and Ill give my opinion tomorrow
