This was in response to SlimVirgins massive edit discussed above with all its problems I reverted his edit because of all teh problems listed above And rather than admit its a bad edit he accuses me of taking ownership of the article Fixing a bad edit  ownership  

No acknowledgement of this accusation being false misplaced or otherwise misdirected has been forthcoming
