Wikipedia Admins Use Gestapo Tactics to Enforce their Agenda 

Greetings it is Germany 1939 all over again  Admin Mark Sweep and user TastyCakes conspire to silence another Wikipedia user that they find objectionable  After being called a Dunb Ass by user TastyCakes and without any warning Admin Mark Sweep a former US Marine has used his abilities as an admin to infinitely block my user priviledges  And all based on his personal dislike of my username and his comradeship with user TastyCakes who were offended by a few harmless WORDS  Welcome to the world of those few who are endowed with superior genetics and the ability to control what we read and learn
