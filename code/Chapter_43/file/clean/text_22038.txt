At the moment there is a four day hiatus while the GA reviewer is busy at work
The images had become an issue  I originally just hid them with a drop down before realising that no matter which way I tried the alt and alt text were not working in fact alt was visible The GA reviewer thinks they would be better spread out over the page but I am not so sure I was trying to keep it more balanced between shipwreck and treasure as they are equally important but without the Jewel pics as they have not emailed me back yet perhaps it might be better to spread them around With the GA review due I thought I had better try and sort them out I tried so many different ways sizes and types of display drop downs wikitables and boxing that I just gave up after three hours I couldnt even see my monitor properly and had to go to bed Surprise surprise the very next day the review started lol  I thought oh crap the images but when I went to look you had already sorted them out 
As the GA reviewer states it is not part of the GA review though
