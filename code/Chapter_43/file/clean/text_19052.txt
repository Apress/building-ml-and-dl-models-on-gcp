No it only allows a single person to remove someones new edit successfully using the 3 revert rule A new edit is not a revert and if what you say is true it does give new editors a handicap because as I said it allows a single person to win over the person adding something new On the other hand if a new edit is not counted as a revert which it isnt anyway then it would take two or more people to cancel out a new edit which would make it truly concensus If new edits are counted as a revert then I dont see Wikipedia going much further then it already has That is why articles stay the same size and never change I have seen this for the last three years The articles only become like figuritive cute little wicker baskets that sometimes have little bits and peieces removes and shoveled around and worded little way different but never change and stay the same little cute backet that it always was Not never informative 995617463
