Agreed about the coverage What nations members of the United Nations Security Council are you referring to specifically And what islands in the Pacific My proposed edit mentions no islands in the pacific at least not separately and if positions of countries members of the United Nations Security Council can be sourced then Id be open to include them I actually have no issue with the length of the section and the inclusion of other countries positions other editors do My proposed edit aimed at trimming it down a bit to compromise with their view
Noted about Gibraltar apparently Im the only one who thinks it has any relevance Ill remove any mention of it from my proposed edit above Regards
