It wasnt my intention to elicit the above pleas for me to stick around a la Malleus nor was it my intention to be a diva or to take my ball and go home  It was more of a protest against unequal treatment and an overly emotional one at that  Ive restored the tools and bot tasks after realizing the collateral damage that was done by deactivating them and deciding that its not right to punish uninvolved users who have nothing to do with the situation  Ill likely be back in the new year  Have a safe one   spill the beans _
