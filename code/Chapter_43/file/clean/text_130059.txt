Hey yo Curps I have been trying to keep it real here on wikipedia making helpful additions and so on and when I was searching some articles this caught my eye

httpenwikipediaorgwikiBig_Game_Hunters_sketch_comedy

I do not know how to request an article for deletion so I thought Id bring it to your attention since u seem to have your business pretty together

As I understand it this article is almost definately written by someone in the group and that is not allowed I think also if you serach these cats in google nothing comes back so it is pretty much Unremarkable People or Group As listed under Speedy Deletion Guidelinezz matter if u ask me

hope I was of some help thinking maybe about registerin a name on the site and adding some fresh new information about the author George Saunders he is great
