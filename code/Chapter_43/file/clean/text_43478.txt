Q for you regarding changing stub class to start class and so on 

Hi again  As you know I have informally adopted Lily Mazaherys page and have been expanding and improving it during Spring break Since it now has so much more information with sources notes etc does it not qualify as a start class instead of stub under Wikipedia guidelines  And if so how can that be changed  As always thanks so much for your guidance and help  I have been really enjoying the learning process here
