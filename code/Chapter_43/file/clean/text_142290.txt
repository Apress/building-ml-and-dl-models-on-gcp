Chapter List disputed information
While defunct chapters have been noted with an asterik some listed chapters notably the colonies are not officially recognized  IMHO it is irresponsible to list those which either AEPi national or local instituions do not officially recognize 

Proposed solutions
 remove the colony section 
 harsh possibly unproductive
 remove all unrecongized groups from the colony section 
 create subsections noting nationally  institutionally recognized either or and none of the above
 confusing and would not conform with Wikistandards
 identify those colonies which are officially recognized by National and those recognized by the institition similar to the asterik phenomena
