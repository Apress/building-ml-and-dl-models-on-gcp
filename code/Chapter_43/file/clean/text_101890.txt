 Rick Perry edit 

Just wondering why you tagged my edit to the death penalty as original research  All the citations were from the websites of the Texas Constitution the Board of Pardons and Parole or the Texas Administrative Code
  
Which is exactly what makes it original research I understand your point but you really need a secondary source relating the law and constitutional provisions to Perry Perfect would be an analysis piece or even a blog in a reputable newspaper saying something like Even if Perry wants to commute Xs death sentence he is prohibited from acting unless the Board of Pardons recommends he does so With a legitimate crack in the door like that you might be able to bring in your primary sources as additional validation and explanation but the mitigation needs to originate outside Wikipedia   

 Garbo VIII 

Cant you delete these sections and start a new one It takes 20 minutes just to scroll down to the end Meanwhile Im really enjoying our conversation and hope it continues take care    
Done Some recent replies posted simultaneously in old section though   

I see that youve changed Acosta back to de Acosta which is fine since thats how shes identified in the Wikipedia entry Vieira refers to her as Acosta Other biographers refer only to Mercedes Anyway many surnames in the romance languages derived from placeslocations like towns or territories So its like referring to her as of the seashore instead of just Seashore Anyway I suppose both will do so Im untroubled by your reversion Dont really care

The Acosta page needs to be updated based on a new biography of her by Bob Shanke interestingly a theatre historian There there is also at least one major error in Wikipedia The author says The two Garbo and de Acosta were introduced to one another by de Acostas lover at the time author Salka Viertel This assertion is simply false Accd to the authors of the 3 biographies I read of G Acosta didnt even know Viertel before she met G G asked Viertel to introduce them and Viertel called Acosta up out of the blue Oh well at this point its someone elses problem to correct Well maybe Ill correct this one thing since Im at it here Im not interested in reading a bio of Acostaat least for the time being I learned enough about her from the G bios Im trying to find time to rewrite the section agbout Gs affairs but I have to read about them all over again for accuracy Happy to see your anal self back at work I know youre always there to review my revisions  

Just made some changes and corrections to the Acosta page but it was stupid since the page is absolutely terrible Hopeless No citations terribly written completely untrustworthy Author of new bio demystifies what he considers to be unfair characterizations of her as basically an obnoxious irritant in Gs life Shes not an insignificant figure in Hollywood and gay circles and deserves a better article greetings  
Yeah I knew the de Acosta thing was questionable which is why the unusually detailed for me edit summary I first checked her article here but didnt rely on it too much probably would have stopped there for consistency if it had used just the Acosta form though Then various discussions on the MoS pages about da de di Mc Mac van and von  the substance of which was it varies so thats when I hit the NYT Mostly the issue got fudged by referring to her throughout articles as Mercedse de Acosta but two articles about her and one about a daughter niece getting married used de Acosta alone Then the coup de gr√¢ce was when I decided to look at the Spanish Wikipedia where I figured they should be able to handle Spanish name
