Do think Wikipedia will ever have serious competition 

I got to thinking about this question when I was invited to join in using Google Plus Googles answer to Facebook which if you have not been invited already I would love to be the one to invite you I believe you still have to be invited by a current user it hasnt gone totally public as far as Ive noticed We have seen Myspace get eclipsed by Facebook to where they are predicting Myspace will be shut down next year and now we see talk that Google Plus may be the serious competition to Facebook now and I agree I enjoy the extras more So have you ever seen anything that has made you think wow if someone ever did X it could really do some damage to Wikipedia editor count or reader count were you ever worried that Conservapedia for instance might threaten Wikipedias popularity for instance Would there ever come a time were you would encourage the Foundation to put out tv commercials for instance if a serious competitor did ever cut into Wikipedia
