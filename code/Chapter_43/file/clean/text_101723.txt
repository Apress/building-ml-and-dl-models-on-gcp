There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors Mtheory etc I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything TOE should solve

1 A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations Moreover these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions As far as I know nothing like that is still available for the string theory Mtheory in contrast to its rather long development and farreaching claims 

2 A good TOE should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles It was actually one of the original Einsteins goals  to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles

3 If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension 11 etc as expected there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification  eg a principle how to project the structures from the 11dim world to our tangible 4dim world In its contemporary status superstring theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification

 
In my opinion the very word theory is rather premature in connection with the superstring theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims
