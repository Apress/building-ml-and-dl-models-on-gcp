There are almost no third party reliable sources which discuss his discoveries The sources that do mention this are careful to state the claims are unconfirmed Furthermore the subject is not covered for having been a former pro snowboarder Lets be clear that term was used only once in passing in local news covering environmental issues The one article youve replaced is one I removed for having used Wikipedia as a source Did you even read the article Im removing it based on the source alone but equally applicable might be WPFART the fact is insignificant according to reliable coverage JFHJr  

The numerous references you refer to probably included the selfpublications by related parties promoting a future event or links to pirated and copyrighted newscasts on youtube which I removed Such press announcements regarding upcoming events cannot be used to claim 1 that the event even actually occurred nor 2 any significance of the accomplishment since the host of presentations necessarily has an interest in puffing and promoting the presentation JFHJr
