I have edited numerous probably more than a dozen FA articles in the past My experience on FAs is that they are far easier to edit after they have been removed from the Main Page Once out of the spotlight simple edits such as those I normally do arent scrutinized so closely  Although today with Irataba I must admit I was extra boldfar bolder than I usually get with FAs  I am usually contented by correcting a typo or two
