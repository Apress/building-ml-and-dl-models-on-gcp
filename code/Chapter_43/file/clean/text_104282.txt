The picture belongs to the top of the article just like other similar articles  This is a Wikipedia article about a man whose picture is available and in public domain The picture belongs right where it is now on top of the article just like any other similar articles  The comparison with the beheaded journalist and the like is completely false  Wikipedia cannot adjust itself to satisfy the policies and preferences of various organizations such as the Bahai organization throughout the world  Wikipedia is a peoples online webbased encyclopedia If this is so offensive to the Bahais they should just limit themselves to the official Bahai sites   0128 27 Mar 2005 UTC
