Hi
 You are probably right I should have asked for a source rather than calling it drivel  I cant say I know a lot about Proust but I remember him being described as a hypochondriac so Im easily convinced regarding odd description of that author  However the addition in question certainly did require a citation
 It is also said that Proust who for a time owned a brothel would enjoy watching young male prostitutes engaging in their trade It is also said however that watching hungry caged rats fight each other to the death or torturing them with hatpins would never fail to bring him to orgasm
 BTW the second edit from this anon has been reverted
 Thanks for keeping an eye on the wiki
