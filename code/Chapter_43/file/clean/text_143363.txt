You claim there is no such thing as SPAMing an image but if you would have checked the history you would see the user tried repeatedly to upload it from non licensed sites and other tactics further the image it self says the license is in doubt I am also an inclusionist if you will However I dont think people should abuse Wikipedia with copyrighted images licensed wrong Seem fair
