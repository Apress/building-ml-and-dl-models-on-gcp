The Punk Rock page has more meat in the text and its a LOT of text Content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text  I do see some areas that can be fleshed out  I think the hardcore page wouldnt work with every section in depth like theirs thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore  but I do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool  I would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be reuploaded  Then it might now be too much and too busy  People read to retain information the right set up enhances that  Too many pictures are a distraction  They take away from the knowledge  More fleshed out sections can help  Ill brainstorm on that until later  I guess add the picture if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little maybe it will balance itself out more The third option is we can fill out some sections more  Make it more balanced and then add the zines photo after so it Accentuates and isnt the meat and potatoes of the section   the sections of influence on other genres  That could be good place to start adding more contentdepth  Ill study some other pages meanwhile when I get a chance then bring that knowledge here  a little later  Thanks a lot  I love to share knowledge and I like sharing that here for free  683915245
