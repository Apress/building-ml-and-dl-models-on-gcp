Fair use rationale for ImageGodofwar2kratosjpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to ImageGodofwar2kratosjpg I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use In addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale Using one of the templates at WikipediaFair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page 

If you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting Image from the dropdown box Note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you tast
