Teachers when covering this subject walk a fine line between sticking by the principles of science and not insulting the Godfearing people of this country A lot of school districts are getting away from teaching evolution altogether and spending scarce classtime covering other aspects of current theory that dont provoke so many lawsuits This is a sad sad thing in my opinion  2240 1 Feb 2005 UTC
