Certainly I havent checked the paper itself but according to the text you inserted it supplied figures for Kingston General Hospital As I noted above there are hundreds of thousands of hospitals in the world and it would be unhelpful for the reader for us to document the rate at all of them and unrealistic for us to try Instead we need to rely upon reliable sources that estimate figures for wider geographical areas
