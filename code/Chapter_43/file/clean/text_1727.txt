I am trying to explain to you once and for all that Neil Armstrong landing on the moon is just as fictitious Santa Claus appearing on Xmas or 007 and his submarine cars How dare you pollute cyberspace with outrageous lies that suggest it was otherwise and that deadly diseased celebrity liars like Armstrongs and Aldrins and Nixons were telling the truth about it all What if young and impressionable children looked up Apollo on wikipedia and all they see is nothing but your deadly mistaken rehashing of late 60s hoaxes presented as scientific achievements
