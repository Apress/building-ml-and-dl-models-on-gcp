Thanks I understand that you are trying to make a compromise But you will agree that my version is better I was explaining what the language of the city is you are explaining what it is not You know some people are trying to deny that people there are speaking a turkic language It is interessting to know that local people call the language Turkish Indeed in Iran when you say someone is speaking turkish you mean he is speking Azerbaijani Anyway Ill prefer if you remove the reference to Tat language and replace Azeri with the scientifically recognized name Azerbaijani_language Latter I will add a language subsection under culture so there will be no complaint about disruptive sentencing
