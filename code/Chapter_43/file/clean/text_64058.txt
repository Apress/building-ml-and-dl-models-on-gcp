Colberts character 

Saying his character is mocking rightwing pundits is fine but there is no source to say he is specifically imitating Hannity or OReilly  True a couple sources do point out similarities but what exactly makes these highly opinionated sources authorities on the specific people who Colbert is supposedly imitating  Colbert mentions that Hannity and OReilly are overthetop as far as personality driven opinions go but he doesnt say thats who hes imitating  Besides he doesnt even say them exclusively he says someone LIKE Hannity or OReilly

His own words dont suffice here and a source pointing out similarities and asserting in a totally nonobjective try putting Bill OReillys bullying mediaage demagoguery into the article and see what you get way is not enough to include the comparison   Karwynn
