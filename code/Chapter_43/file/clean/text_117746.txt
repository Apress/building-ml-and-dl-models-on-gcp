Well praise be  Its vanishingly rare for someone with a username to get blocked for reverting anonymous edits no matter how many times they do so within 24 hours  The most I saw that someone didnt get blocked for was 31  So nice to see it happen here  You should block Iryna Harpy for the insane series of reverts at selfarrest as well 4 in less than an hour even if you dont count the sock puppets  186913492
