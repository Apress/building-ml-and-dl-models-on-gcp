I have been designing a power suit its purely theoretical at the moment however and Have been trying to work some kind of piezoelectric power circuit into it basically The suit more mecha like really and am thinking of a aluminiumiridiumosmium alloy as the main armor plating of the suit with a more flexible buckminsterfullerene carbon nanotube material for the underlying material for the smaller human size  models with small armor plates all over the place no exacts yet but I am really influenced by the TAU I placed the original comment about them in some one nicely neatened it up and made it coherent XD thanks and have been thinking of railguns in miniiature forever feel free to commentleave suggestions etc  Avatar of Nothing
