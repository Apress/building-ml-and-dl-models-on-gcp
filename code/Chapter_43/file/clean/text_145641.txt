It seems as if this wiki page would really benefit by being rewritten into a model that is similar to the other pages in the same category which would make the article much more informative than it is right now The parts that would definitely work are the origin and history and the addition of controversies is a good addition as well The sectionSatanism and new religious movements is very appropriate and could contain some interesting information but the Practices and varieties should be switched so it would be varieties and then practices
I really like the inclusion of the demographics section this would be excellent and it is something that is missing from this article
