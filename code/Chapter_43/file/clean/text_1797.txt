Your argument is that we should take your word over that of the sources All you have said is your own personal opinion and original research rather than facts supported by reliable sources As I stated earlier present reliable sources stating otherwise if you disagree with the sources given Secondly there is nothing wrong with the integrity of the sources given You claim that the Global Financial Centres Index commissioned by the City of London Corporation must be biased because it is based in London You fail to mention the other two sources given Forbes and Mastercard both of which are American and based in New York City Nor do you provide any sources supporting your notion that the City of London Corporation is a biased institution It is clear from this argument that the article faces two choices it can go with Thmc1s own personal opinion and original research or the word of the City of London Corporation Forbes and Mastercard
