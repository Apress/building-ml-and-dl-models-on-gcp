Sorry I couldnt quite remember precisely what you said nor where you said it so was careful not to directly attribute this to you I understood you to be giving an opinion on the likely view taken by others not that this was an instruction from you to me But I remembered taking a very strict interpretation of what you said

The strictest interpretation I regarded they would take was a problem if you were editing and picking up new projects I therefore felt inhibited from doing anything else How does someone define ignored If I edited elsewhere for five minutes Five hours I would expect someone to put the boot in under almost any pretext  as in this indefinite block whose reasoning was arrived at after the decision to block was made Hence the review of my contributions after I took issue with his reasoning on his claims of breaches of policy
