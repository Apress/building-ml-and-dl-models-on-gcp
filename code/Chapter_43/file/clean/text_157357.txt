Im not interested in getting into a content debate on the article but as I said on the talkpage there need to be reliable sources that verify text  The fact that there is debate on an article talkpage isnt evidence of anything other than the fact that there is a debate on that talkpage  All I want to see is verifiable information from reliable sources without original synthesis portrayed in a neutral way  I slept through my physics classes at Uni I dont want to relive that stuff by debating it here talk
