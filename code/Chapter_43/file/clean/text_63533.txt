If a pitcher comes into the game during the 5th inning with the lead and never relinquishes the lead he actually earns the win The starting pitcher gets a no decision because he could not make it through 5 innings 5 innings in a game must be played before it is official If it is rained out before the 5th inning it is not an official game and must be replayed or resumed If 5 innings have been played and the game then gets rained out the score is final I only mention all this to explain the significance of that 5th inning in regards to pitchers
