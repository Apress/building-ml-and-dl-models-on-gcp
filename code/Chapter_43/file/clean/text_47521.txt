On UserTimothy Usher

Assalamu Alaikum Please dont confront Timothy He makes it a habit of infuriating people with his allegations and POVpushing and then complaining to admins until he find one naive enough to act on his complaining and affect a user block Hed done it once to you already hes done it with me and hes tried to do something to Faisal Hes playing games here Its probably best to just stick to the editing and make sure that articles relating to Islam remain NPOV and free of their polemicism I appreciate your help
