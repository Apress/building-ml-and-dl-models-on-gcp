But I wasnt editing any disputed material with the anonymous IP addressI was working on other articles and categories not related to any dispute I made no personal attacks with the IP address nor did I leave any uncivil edit summaries The only real problem leading to my block seemed to be me recreation of CategoryFormer Jews under a different name which is entirely OK per Wikipolicy when I should have taken it to WPDRV Im still learning the policies and procedures around here Besides that this indefinite block is entirely uncalled for and is amazingly unfair
