Here is the only thing I can find regarding use of images on a page though this is not directed towards user pages

5 Images that are unused obsolete violate fairuse policy or are unencyclopedic

as a grounds for deletion  However my page clearly says a definition in pictures  It is meant to be encyclopedic the images are being used to demonstrate information about me and they are not in violation as far as I can tell of fairuse policy  As well the deletion policy says Pages that can be improved should be edited or tagged not nominated for deletion showing that this page should not have been nominated for deletion as it can be improvedand I will work towards that later today  Thank you   

I cannot find a guideline that prohibits the use of photographs much less a personal photo album on user pages  Indeed the photographs here are not a personal photo album  So unless I can come across such a guideline I will leave those pictures  Any objections  Thanks
