Beginning with your first edit every talk page entry you have created seems to be full of arguments and vitriol  You seem to lack the ability to cooperate and work with others  This is required if you want to work on an encyclopedia  An indefinite block doesnt mean forever it simply means that there is no single period of time that is guaranteed to prevent further disruption so youve forced my hand here  As always any admin is free to adjust without my prior permission  It is my hope that someone can convince you how to collaborate in a method that is consistent with our goals here  As it is your methods are inconsistent with our mission    2
