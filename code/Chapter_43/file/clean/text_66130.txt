Contested deletion 

This page is not unambiguously promotional because your reason here   

FWIW I havent worked at the company for over 8 years I originally created the page to contribute to Wikipedia on a subject which at the time I knew about  I dont know how accurate what is written is at the moment as I havent followed it but I know the company does still exist as I have a friend who still works there  While I agree the wording of the opening 2 sentences at the moment do now come across a bit marketingey Im guessing someone has edited since it was created as a Wikipedia user Id find it stranger a big company wouldnt have a page on Wikipedia than that the page had some marketing speak  Rather than deleting the page entirely why not just fix it by cutting down to the first two sentences to just have the facts about what it does and size  eg  Isobar is a global full service digital marketing agency with over 70 locations across 44 markets worldwide
