I was one of the people who removed that part Erm well my reason is that while it may do good as a separate article i doubt if we need to see how nairs had sex and how their women were classified in this article Besides i doubt if this relates to the Nairs alone It could be included if suitable in the Kamasutra article or something rather than in this article I am not so sure on seeing a part that goes into details on ways of sex and how women were classed and on what basis and the male privilege to enjoy her in every conceivable way For one even if u argue its a work by a nair it doesnt need mention on the nair page Secondly dont u think its a little too explicit in details You dont find articles on other castes stating the ways they had sexual intercourse etc So i vote for removing that part
