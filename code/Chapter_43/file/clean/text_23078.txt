Tim
Thank you for your message on my talk page The concern is primarily that the link is being promoted inappropriately to Wikipedia I have removed the new link you added to Philadelphia Experiment as it appears connected to the other link you previously added klircom 
f you feel the link would add great value to the article per WPEL and should be readded please bring it up on the articles talk page and allow other editors to discuss it first
Thanks for your understanding let me know if you have any other concerns or questions  talk
