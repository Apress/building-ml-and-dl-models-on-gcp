That onethat was written immediately after recieving that lovely message so I was angry  Is that an excuse for it nocould have it been written differently of course  Should have it been written at all no  I could have deleted it without an edit summary but I didnt  That shows you that when him and I come anywhere near each other it isnt good  Again not an excuse just the way it sadly is   TC
