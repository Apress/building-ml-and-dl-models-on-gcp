Actually Ill address the concerns as the site admin The site truly has too much ads The links in the menu are a bit misleading and Its one of the things that I intend to remove very soon Any other ad unit however will remain in place The profits just barely cover the costs of maintaining the site not to mention the time I invest in regular updates So if any ads at all are a problem by itself I cant say much But I think every site has its own way of funding itself and as long as the information is free and th ads are reasonalby placed its oaky
As for the Cuban style only concern Salsa Lust is not intended to be CubanCasino style only actually its even covering some Miami style moves too Salsa Lust suppose to cover other styles too with LA as the first next candidate but it might take some time until it happens for various reasons So by looking at the rules presented it might be true that its more relevent to the CubanCasinostyle specific salsa article however it wont take too long until it will be relevant to this page as well
