You should check your facts before placing bans to protect anonymous accountless users who conduct harrasement campaigns against dedicated wiki editors An anonymous user took offence when I reverted his edit and called it absurd as it was he changed a 104 F 40 C to 40 F 40 C Thats absurd I resent you protecting morons that dont check facts references or edits They are now using the Lockheed A12 page to get back at me out of spite One of them placed a whole bunch of citation needed tags in a Section as he read my talk page and knew that would piss me off You do not deserve the powers you have you intellectually crippled mouthbreathing halfwit Stay away from my talk page and stopm using your power to perpetuate the cyberbullyng campaign waged by 2 anonymous dickheads Regards
