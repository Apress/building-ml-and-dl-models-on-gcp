Some linguists prefer to restrict the use of the expression protoMalay to a reconstructed early version of Malay  Others include under the term certain languages particularly those with low linguistic change that are closer to that reconstructed language than the main dialects of present day Malay  The term is also used by nonlinguists to refer to people who are Malay related but who occupied the Malay peninsula prior to the main invasion of the Malay people See eg Orang Asli
