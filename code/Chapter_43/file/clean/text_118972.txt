Arlington does not have a gay neighborhood but there is LGBT presence in every neighborhood We are represented by the only openly gay State Delegate an openly gay man on our County Board reelected twice and a lesbian on our School Board Ive added my link at least four times but someone keeps removing it What is Wikipedias policy on removing links There are plenty of LGBT topics so why does my link keep disappearing AGLA is a more relevant link than a few of the others that are left alone I didnt delete Glen Carlyn because I live in Lyon Village
