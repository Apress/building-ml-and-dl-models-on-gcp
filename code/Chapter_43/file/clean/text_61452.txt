Jayron you seem to misinterpreting my posts Id recommend reading them again as its clear you dont seem to understand my main point No where in any of my previous posts did I oppose the idea that I was being involved in an edit war or ask that my unblocking be reverted I asked for you to explain the differences if any in my actions and those of SubSevens who essentially did the same thing as me reverted posts without any attempt at resolving the dispute via a talk page 
First you said you werent edit warring I challenge you to find a quote that clearly shows me saying that I wasnt edit warring Not a very good reader are you Jayron
