Im putting it back  It is about compensation in general  I dont require a separate reference for each cartridge article saying that The 300 HH Magnum is a cartridge designed to fire a bullet  It is known that a cartridge fires a bullet  If youre going to ask for a reference ask for it on the cartridge firearm page not on each and every individual page requiring that the reference points out that the 300 HH Magnum fires a bullet  Who knows maybe the 244 Remington does not fire a bullet Your logic is flawed and you are STILL hounding me
