Well your comments certainly sound authoritative  Why do you privilege Friedrichs narrative over Bazzanas  His biography is quite clear on this point Glenns birth certificate gave his name as Gold Glenn Herbert  The family name had always been Gold and when his grandfatherestablished the family business in 1913 he gave it the name Gold Standard Furs pun presumably intended  All of the documents through 1938 that survive among Goulds papers give his surname as Gold but beginning at least as early as 1939 the family name was almost always printed as Gould in newspapers programs and other sources the last confirmed publication of Gold is in the program for a church supper and concert on October 27 1940 Bazzana Wondrous Strange 24

Now I dont want to stand in the way of your sanctimoniousness but I believe that documentary evidence weighs in as the only proof of historical fact  Your quotation from Friedrich offers no documentary evidence  only an undated business card

Bazzana goes on to discuss the regrettable climate of increasing xenophobia that apparently prevailed in Toronto at the time and the influence this may have had on the documented name change but any thoughtful person can surmise from the dates 193940 that this may have been the case

In any event this entire discussion is much less problematic and harmful whatever that means than inane and boring  The information is anecdotal and of mild and passing interest but really WHO CARES on way or the other
