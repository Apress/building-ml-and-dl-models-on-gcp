User TastyCakes Superior Intellect Shines in Message 

Greetings All

Once again the user TastyCakes showcases her superior intellect and reasoning in her response  Had TastyCakes followed the history of the original edits to US History and Expansion TastyCakes would have seen that HerrGoebbles was only trying to add new information regarding the brutal consequences of US government sanctioned practices which are clearly stated at the US Department of State website under Indian Treaties and the Removal act of 1830  Instead user TastyCakes and an admin MarkSweep took it upon themselves to block user HerrGoebbles with absolutely no warning  This seems to be an accepted practice on Wikipedia embraced by a few users and Admins who wish to control and block any possibility of discussion about reality

Welcome to The New World
