Pruning notables lists 

Given that a notability is not inherited and b most NFL cheerleaders are models of some sort and c many of thee cheerleaders only did the job for a year meaning that this is really a biographical footnote not the other way around Im going to remove all redlinked nonwled and redirected names  In short if they dont have a BIO article about themselves they dont meet GNG and therefore arent really notable
