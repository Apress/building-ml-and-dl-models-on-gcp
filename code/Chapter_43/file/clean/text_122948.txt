Super Cup stats 

Ive added the match stats from those games as its a Football Leaguesanctioned competition I did a lot of digging about on the internet to find the match details goal scorers and attendance but I can only find the lineups from the Everton games from a thirdparty club website  Ive not added them to the squad statistics table as it would be incomplete it would be grateful if anyone can find the teams lined up against Norwich
