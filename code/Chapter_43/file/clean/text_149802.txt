Dont send emails pretending to represent me ever again Zordrac 

I was going to suggest that you have to change the article but I see that you already have  This seems to be so that you can push your point of view  Oh yes  I somehow managed to perpetrate an underhanded POV assault by rearranging the intro so that the various definitions of the term were all discussed together  Yeah sure thats firstclass POVpushing there  God knows youd never do something as dastardly as refactoring  And by the way I will thank you not to send email to Daniel Brandt pretending to represent me and asserting that your interpretation of my actions which I never endorsed no matter how many times you falsely repeated them is what I meant
