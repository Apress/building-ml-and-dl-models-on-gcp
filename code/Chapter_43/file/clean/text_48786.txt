Advice Please 

Hello AustralianRupert  Id like to start updating the Air Forces Memorial page and as far as images are concerned have previously placed these directly on the page concerned but Im advised this may contravene the wiki selfpromotion policy However if I wait for approval especially as this is a stub and others may not happen along frequently the update may take a longtime Ive placed some example images on the discussion page Is this a case where I could update the page and then have it examined for potential contravention of policy Better to get approval for such action first rather than after the fact Thanks for ant help
  

PS Until recently and for some time the wiki page also carried a link to my single topic web page about the memorial  Im not so concerned about the possibility of adding this back in although that would I believe add to the wiki page definitely for others to determine but youll see its generally the source of the material Im proposing to place on wiki  has been of direct interest to families abroad with commemorated relatives
