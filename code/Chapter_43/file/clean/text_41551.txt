I heard that the reason for both the T64 and T72 was because the T64 was mechanically complex making it somewhat unsuitable as an export tank due to maintenance issues requires more parts and more thorough checks and the T72 was designed to be a simpler but not necessarily cheaper tank that could be exported in addition to providing balance in the soviet arsenal it also served as internal competition
