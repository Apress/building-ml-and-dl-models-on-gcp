Dear Squeakbox  I have been very polite to you compared to your incredible persistent rudeness and use of three different identities upon me  I have saved your entire string of correspondence so have at it   If I recall correctly you threatened me with a Honduran jail for vandalising Wikipedia when I was the one who wrote correctly  Moreover I covered Solanas Spanish political career very thoroughly and you falsely accused me of not doing so  It seems my biggest mistake was once writing Ferninand Gonazalez instead of Felipe Gonzalez which would have been a simple edit for you  Instead you launched an unseemly internet career of calling me a troll and a vandal among other things  Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days if it wasnt one more blind your faith in Haile Selassie the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty  If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs I could make one fine case out of that but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below  Why dont you go pick on someone else  CONSTANCE
