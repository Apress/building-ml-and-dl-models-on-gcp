Dear reviewer

thank you very much for your suggestions on the article I wrote on Alessandro Liberati To address your concerns about his notability

he is especially known as one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration an international network of over 28000 volunteers in more than 100 countries formed to organize research information about health care interventions in a systematic way to aid well informed health care decisions see also the description available in Wikipedia about the Collaboration To date more than 5000 systematic reviews on specific topics have been published in the Cochrane Library Due to its relevance widely acknowledged by clinicians health care researchers and policymakers the Cochrane Collaboration has a seat on the World Health Assembly to provide inputs on resolutions of the World Health Organization The founder role of Liberati has been acknowledged by Sir Iain Chalmers Chalmers I Alessandro Liberati a personal appreciation Epidemiologia  Prevenzione 2012363 Available at httpwwwepiprevitattualitC3A0alessandroliberatiunricordopersonale who is himself acknowledged as one of the founders of the Collaboration in 1993 see his profile in Wikipedia The Italian Cochrane Centre was one of the first to be established in 1994 Other people have their profile on Wikipedia mainly because of their role in the Collaboration aside from Iain Chalmers see also Dave Sackett and Chris Silagy The relevant role of Liberati in the Collaboration can be also better understood by reading the countless acknowledgements in the farewell page httpwwwcochraneorgfeaturesfarewellprofessoralessandroliberati  and in the memory book httpwwwcochraneorgalessandromemorybook posted on the Cochrane website
As for his published work one of the relevant features indicated in the Wikipedia notability guidelines for academics he is author of more than 200 papers published in peer reviewed and indexed journals as it can be easily verified in Pubmed or in Google Scholar some of these papers represent highly cited academic work especially on how to report results of meta analyses and systematic reviews 
As for other characteristics which can be worth highlighting also according to the Wikipedia guidelines he was on editorial boards of prestigious and selective academic journals such as the Annals of Internal Medicine house organ of the American College of Physicians and the British Medical Journal of the British Medical Association
Last but not the least several obituary articles followed his death on specialized medical journals among these I would like to highlight the one on The Lancet Watts G Alessandro Liberati Lancet 2012379214 which is according to the Journal Citation Index the second general medical journal for number of citations and the one on the British Medical Journal Magrini N Smith R Alessandro Liberati Campaigned for high quality evidence relevant to patients BMJ 2012344e1101
All these things I tried to make explicit in my article supporting them with several citations for verifiability a few of which also available online I understand your point that my article may appear as a tribute to a recently dead person As for neutral point of view I didnt find testimonies contrary to the good reputation I reported for Liberati To limit the tribute feeling that the article may transmit I cut the last two paragraphs on his work in Italy and on his networking role

Hoping that this may help support the new submission I send you my best regards   Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  
Jshapely I do not think anyone has contested the notability of your subject simply the general tone of the article   Theoretically the Wikipedia should just report facts   You may have looked at WPNPOV  Also related is WPPEACOCK   Let me look over your article this week end   I have marked it as under review   If I feel comfortable with the article I will approve it for you   If I am not so co
