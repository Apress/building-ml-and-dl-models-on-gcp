There is no way on earth it was a historical country Yes well try telling that to  Frankly I dont know what his current views are or whether hes stopped pushing that recently but I know Ive been trying to hammer that point for months over there For some reason I honestly cannot fathom why hes attached to presenting General Nedics Government of National Salvation as a WWII Serbian state see this version for example

Tomasevich and Ramet as I recall are both very clear on the issue

Do you have any suggestions as to an alternative article title Theres the problem Notice the wording of the current compromise title Serbia under German occupation What Serbia was it that was under occupation As I said above there was no Serbia since 1918 and the Federal State of Serbia was only de facto established after the liberation of the territory in question with the establishment of the ASNOS on 12 November 1944 in newlyliberated Belgrade It does not even geographically correspond with postwar Serbia as it is significantly smaller

The whole situation over there is a mess born out of compromise We essentially have only two organizations in the area the Military Administration in Serbia and its subordinate Government of National Salvation As far as Im concerned its perfectly fine whether we decide to cover them as one article entitled Military Administration in Serbia or if the Government of National Salvation gets its own article What we do not need is this weird article entitled as if it covers an entirely imaginary occupied country The point is that the official real name of the territory was Military Administration in Serbia A situation perfectly analogous with all the other five Military Administrations

As I said the situation is confused by the fact that Serbia is apparently the nickname for the Military Administration in Serbia ie the territory known under that occupation designation Look at Tomasevich He says the Puppet Government of Serbia suggesting to a person who did not actually read the text that this Serbia was some sort of puppet country Even though it is perfectly obvious as you say that there was no such historical country Enter PANONIAN proclaiming that Tomasevich supports him in the claim that there was a country called Serbia and that the Government of National Salvation was only the government thereof And then here comes General Nedic with some coins he issued with the name Serbia and presto  a new historical country   talk
