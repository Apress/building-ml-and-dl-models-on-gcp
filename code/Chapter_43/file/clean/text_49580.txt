Ive used Wikipedia before its true and I am largely familiar with the policies here  Who hasnt and who isnt  Highlighting and linking and other editing style  Provided by the javascript toolbar at the top of the edit box and by judicious coopying of other edits  Not hard really  Prior to this point I have never edited content on Wikipedia merely treating it as one of the first hits for research materials it was your wanton destruction of content that prompted me to register  As for following you around to disrupt I have only edited on this page and your personal talk page to ask a couple of questions which you obligingly deleted as being edits by a disruptive troll  This can be verified by looking at SpecialContributionsTeseaside  I dont of course expect my voice as that of a largely noncontributing member to carry much weight
