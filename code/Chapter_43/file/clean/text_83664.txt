Hi Graham

OK  so youve blocked me for a month Im okay with that I apologize for messing up your FAC section I need to say that you and that other admin guy Ian Rose have only ever struck me as decent as fair 

But Im not apologizing for anything else Cliques sicken me Im an Oxfordeducated Brit and can spot slime and hypocrisy a mile off I consider the actions of Brian Boultons clique to be a huge kick in the teeth to the many nominators whose articles will be archived due to lack of interest I believe too that Boulton and his clique takes the piss because he knows you lack the authority to do anything This is wrong and you know it 

Youve got some really good guys here on Wikipedia but youre allowing your FAC process to be devalued I think this is a shame
