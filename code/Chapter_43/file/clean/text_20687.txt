Its hard to imagine what could constitute serious opposition to mainstream antiracism but would also pass muster under your criteria  PBS and California Newsreel are not scientific organizations either  However like AmRen they have marshalled scientists and opinion writers to help put forward their views  Ironically AmRen has often been evaluated with alarm as more dangerous than other groups by antiracists because of the quality of its writing and its calm and scholarly tone  In any event your subjective assesment heavily influenced by your personal opinions on the subject matter of whether AmRens view of race is worthwhile or base or whether the pieces writing is high quality is not sufficient grounds for removal  You will simply have to tolerate the occasional link to an article you disagree with even strongly  I will restore the link soon unless given an convincing reason why not
