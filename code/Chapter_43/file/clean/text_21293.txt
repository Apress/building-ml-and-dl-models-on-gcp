Sandy I didnt expect a prose review although you made some good suggestions I only wanted it closed in time for the anniversary and thought that it met all the necessary criteria Im not really concerned if a delegate feels the urge to make suggestions or not since that depends on the quality of the reviews which is as we all know highly variable So I wouldnt think that youve placed yourself in a COI situation just because you made some comments andor suggestions As a delegate you have to step up if the reviewers have missed some things in your estimation Thats just doing whats necessary
