Wifeys World
I reverted your addition to this article please read the talk page before adding the owners names in again For a while this article was in a constant state of flux as the owners of WW tried to keep their name out of it In my opinion considering WPBLP the owners request to remain unnamed and the fact the article is about the website not about them it seems better to NOT name them This viewpoint has some support on the talk page and it means that the article isnt in the middle of an edit war all the time Anyways feel free to take a new poll on the talk page
