Hi Ronz I have spent a great deal of time trying to put together some meaningful and relevant content on the product design and industrial design pages which brings it more uptodate and includes the context of environmental sustainability The debates on product lifespans articulated through the theory of emotionally durable design tickly important here Professor Chapmans work in this area therefore provides an excellent example of how to deal with sustainability issues through the disciplines of product design and industrial design and its importanthis work is featured on these page Perhaps remove reference to him but leave all references to the theory of emotionally durable design and the supporting contextual statement Thanks
