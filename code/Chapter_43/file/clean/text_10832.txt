Theres far too much talk and stagnation on Wikipedia  Ive seen discussions go on for two years without a change being made  but Ill go so far as to say that ZE is much more than a range of cars by Renault as they are not ICE vehicles at all They are EVs a completely different class of vehicle Renault is making an dedicated commitment to develop these EVs and bring them to market and the fact that two of the four current ZE vehicles are based on existing ICE vehicle bodies doesnt alter that fact Well see what Renault will announce next for ZE but according to Renault this classrangewhatever will only grow
