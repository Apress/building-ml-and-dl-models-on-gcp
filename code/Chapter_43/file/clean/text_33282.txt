Sudhan 

I saw your comments concering the editors on this article as you can see I asked both editors to put there arguments on the talk page rather than just deleting everything both editors dont think that is necessary now they went to my other article and put the notability thing on it even though that was already decided in 2010  See Ghulam Ahmad engineer

So I am not sure what else i am supposed to do  Maybe you can look at the article Sudhan and decide for yourself one editor all he did was google sudhan and go the government of AJK website

looking forward to  your reply
