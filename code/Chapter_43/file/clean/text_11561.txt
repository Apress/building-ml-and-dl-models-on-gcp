Youre right further action must be taken and Im taking it alright I posted the notice of rumours in the article in a very prominent place but explaining its only a rumour so far  for many weeks now but I wont you to push an uncomfirmed rumor originating from a  forum which was then confirmed by a series of posts on some random fansite as already estabilished fact Youre free to come back when youll get any official as in from the creators confirmation in a magazine andor an actually respectable website requirements it has a Wikipedia article like IGN and unlike TRMK You might even go and write a separate article on Mortal Kombat HD Arcade Kollection or whatever and you know what Id help you out with it

Also stop your disruptive edits like reverting my further attempts to finish the very important reception section which has been mostly written by me already and now Im going to finish it
