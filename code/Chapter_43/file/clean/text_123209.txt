Hi Kim 
I move that the editfreeze be unlocked as I believe I have made my point what with my neutrality flag being frozen in the article long enough now I move that with the overwhelming consensus of opinion against me even with sockpuppets in play the neutrality flag be deactivated and the edit function restored I vow not to flag the music section in this article again unless provoked into doing so by ungracious comments I reserve the right to maintain my point of view about the subjectivity of this section but I uphold to defer to the majority as my point has been wellestablished and my neutrality flag maintaining its presence is synonymous with this point I thank you all for an engaging debate and I look forward to hopefully supporting your views in the future Thanks once again Bazzajf
