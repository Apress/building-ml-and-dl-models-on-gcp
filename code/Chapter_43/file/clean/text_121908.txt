Fine gentlemen but as it appears its only ourselves having this discussion allow me to submit this for your inspection as sent by Turner May 19 to all media the TPS and its Board blocked by the latter two and yes  Fantino himself in response to the latest headlines If you ever change your minds

Original to Leo Kinahan counsel for Sgt Jim Cassells

Mr Kinahan

Having discovered how sensitive you are about your email address note that I have included you as a BCC to protect your privacy As I have been battling with the media ever since my saga began I am only including them at this time in the hope that  considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed  they may finally be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began

As briefly as I can describe it I was set up by 55 Division in November of  98 with a manufactured charge of Criminal Harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my thenneighbourhood to obviate potential civil litigation I had against it and the parent chain Second Cup LtdCome trial the following year and representing myself I went to court with 39 witnesses several exculpatory documents and more 

As a result of my actions and an airtight defence the complainant  who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop John Maciek  and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to respectively take and avoid the stand

When this was articulated by myself the original two arresting officers Paul Scudds immediately afterwards appointed by Fantino to Internal Affairs itself and Sheila Richardson attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant causing me to secure counsel ostensibly for my own protection in the person of Lorne Honickman

Where I lose all of the media in their zeal to protect one of their peers is the fact that Honickman took a bribe from Second Cup CEO  Michael  Bregman to throw the trial and protect their good name which resulted in his excluding every one of my witnesses ordering transcripts to be altered by a Ministry of the AG court reporter  who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding along with her sisterfellow AG employee who resided elsewhere refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more

After dismissing Honickman  but still having to return to court to continue the trial  I received a phone call at home on Friday January 7 2000 from 55s John Graham informing me that I would not make it to College Park alive with the evidence of all that I put before you now

Thirtysix hours later just after 1000 am on January 9 the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door  armed with billy clubs black leather beater gloves and cell phones  with the stated intention taped phone messages retrieved after my toonarrow escape of killing me

Since then I have run the entire gamut of the complaint system including three cops I was publicly handed to by Fantino at his precious Town Hall meetings Stu Eley Wayne Cotgreave and Mike Trimble  stueleytorontopoliceonca waynecotgreavetorontopoliceonca  miketrimbletorontopoliceonca

Prior to  and after  this upon my own initiative were Bryce Evans bryceevanstorontopoliceonca Dave Mcleod davemcleodtorontopoliceonca and Steven Pipe stevenpipetorontopoliceonca all of whom have had the displeasure  or more the sadistic pleasure  of dealing withblowing me off  and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after as did the others plus every one of the usual suspects in Pro Standards  janewilcoxtorontopoliceonca johnknaaptorontopoliceonca  rickgauthiertorontopoliceonca  that I was referred to and others including Scott Gilbert of 55 Division     scottgilberttorontopoliceonca whom I was forced to cooperate with by the OCCOPS and provided a gruelling eight hour video taped statement only to have same outright ignored  and my complaint dismissed  by the latter

During your clients original investigation I actually contacted  RCMP Supt John Neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix as Fantino was bleating about rooting out perjury and corruption I was subject to both during my trial and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months only to have  come the moment of truth   Neily regretfully inform me that hed been ordered to drop my case

Now if youll allow me to quote from the most recent media reports
