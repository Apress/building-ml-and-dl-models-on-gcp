History and studies suggesting a conservative bias understating dangers  

This sections rationale is clearly flawed in that it confuses the word conservative with the meaning of cautious which is obviously what a preliminary scientific statement must be and is accordingly described as such by all sources with the politicallycharged word conservative Just because a scientist is eventually overcautious and may understate his predictions so that they are not hijacked by scaremongers and susceptible laymen including journalists it doesnt mean that he is politically speaking a conservative or just too businessfriendly It means he is doing his job well and responsibly that is with caution These two concepts of being conservative are conflated here into one single line of criticism which is obviously absurd and simply reflects the rampant POV of this section  as if relying on commondreamsorg as an encyclopedic source wasnt POV enough
