Hello and welcome to Wikipedia

Here are some tips to help you get started

 If you havent already please add your name to the new user log to let others know a little about yourself
 Read the article describing how to edit a page and feel free to experiment in the Sandbox
 When editing pages use the preview button before submitting and try to fill in the summary box for every edit
 Eventually read the Manual of Style and Policies and Guidelines
 If you need help post a question at the Help Desk or ask me on my talk page
 Explore be bold in editing pages and most importantly have fun

Good luck

PS One last helpful hint To sign your posts like I did above on talk pages for example use the  symbol To insert just your name type  3 tildes or to insert your name and timestamp use  4 tildes
