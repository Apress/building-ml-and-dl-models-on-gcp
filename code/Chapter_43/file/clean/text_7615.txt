PPS  Me yet again  I forgot to mention the photo of the two French marine infantrymen must I think date from 1884 or 1885 rather than as late as 1888  It was taken by Edouard Hocquard who served with the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps as a doctor in those two years  He took part in the Bac Ninh campaign March 1884 and the Lang Son Campaign February 1885  Im pretty sure the picture which is one of a suite of images he took in Tonkin that have been published on the internet dates from 1884 and have said so when I used it in my Tonkin Expeditionary Corps article  Click on the image there and itll link you to the website
