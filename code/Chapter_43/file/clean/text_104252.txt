Notability concerns 

Hi Agricola44 as article creator and largest contributor I would like to place a notability tag on this article but since I get blocked for everything I do I am firstly consulting others in this manner This seems like a cool little medal contest and all but since it is being awarded by SAE International SAE formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers is a professional organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace automotive and commercial vehicle industries basically a professional organization I do not find this notable What policies govern this and what makes it notable to you
In the very least we should probably remove the list of winners per WPNOTDIR since those entries have no secondary souces127
