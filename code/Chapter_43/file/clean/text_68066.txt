And Supposed Title References 

Ive just reverted a group of socalled title references that an editor has attempted to add without benefit of any sources to the episode summaries  While some of them certainly make sense many more are arguable at best and all are WPOR absent any source that supports the thinking of the writers who gave any given episode its title  In a couple cases I can posit alternative references a couple seem to have been overlooked and all in all were back to WPINDISCRIMINATE information made more problematic by the lack of sources
