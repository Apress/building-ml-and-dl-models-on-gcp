The focusing on dinosaurs as being the main or only  subject of religious interest doesnt really stand up since it is sufficient to show that a conflict exists between bible literalists young earthers and science in general if any life form can be shown to have died out before Adam and Eve This relates to the doctrine of original and the fall of man It would appear that some people believe that if any dinosaurs can be shown to have coexisted with man then the problem of bible chronology and science is solved but thats no the case There is also the issue of dating fossils in general and how it compares with the age of the earth claimed by YEC The reality is this article should perhaps be a sub article from a would be parent article Religious Perspectives on the Age of the Universe that also has sub pages dealing with Big Bang Theory Doppler Red Shift and all the other dating techniques used by science that seem to contradict the YEC arguments
