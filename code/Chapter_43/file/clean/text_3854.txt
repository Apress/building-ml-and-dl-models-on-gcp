I know its this guy The article clearly should be deleted and an AfD would be pointless If I were an admin I would block him right away and delete his stuff   
Well blocked isnt banned Repeated block evasion might result in banning though Moreover I actually deleted an artcile of his per WikipediaArticles for deletionQuantum Ring Theory That mentioned some Naveen Dankal so the latest account might be also be likeminded person Ill give him a welcome page and then well see  
Oh youre an admin I thought there was some sort of rule that admins had to say so on their user pages
He might not be technically banned but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were I dont know how else to deal with this   
Not sure about the rule but I actually forgot to restore my user page after latest wikibreak
For the moment I assume the two accounts are not the same If not well certainly notice and can take action  

 Heisenbergs Scientific Method 

  Naveen Dankal  
With due respect to Heisenberg and his contribution to science I don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidualI have only stated some of the limitations of Heisenbergs works with due references and just brought out a fact how Heisenbergs method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way lopesidedness of our universe
I just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia On the other hand I also disagree with the block you received resp the unblock denied and have raised that point  

Thanks for Unblockingappreciate your stepwill try to keep wiki rules in mind   0622 14 May 2008 
Well let me know once you have further concerns or questions

i am making a few changes in the article on Heisenbergs scientific methodI would like to know wether any refernces to banned members works jeopardizes the articles chances of getting hosted or such refernces can be incorporated without any hitch Moreover before hosting the articles can they be emailed to the administrators for a review so that the users are not lead to the worries of being blocked or banned
There are two different issues The  While that doesnt mean they can never be cited it is unlikely to go without discussion Your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the Isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations What is missing is the intermediate step what reliable sources have written about eg the mystery of the scarcity of the dineutron or limitations of the Copenhagen interpretation Without including such secondary sources it will be a WPSY
