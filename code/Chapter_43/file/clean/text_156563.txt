Hello

Hi Shadow Ranger Just so you know I share many of yoour sentiments about these inventions pages I like you would like to see all of them deleted from Wikipedia But my point from the beginning was this If the United States gets delated then why does China England etc have the right to have their inventions pages If you can ever get a group going that can have the pwer to delete all invention pages from Wikipedia you can count on me 

Thanks for the help with Twinkle Some people just do not know that Tim Berniers lee invented the WWW and not the internet Thus I hate having to revert edits that people stupidly make  

Happy Hannukah
