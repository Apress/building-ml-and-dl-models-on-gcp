I disagree especially as youre talking about a comparison that was being made in 2004 when Wikicities had that name The GeoCities article states GeoCities was the thirdmost visited website on the World Wide Web behind AOL and Yahoo  thats not negative Anyway the whole thing should probably be removed since most people were not making any such comparisons Instead people were assuming it was a wiki site for cities which is why the name was dropped in 2006 5816875100
