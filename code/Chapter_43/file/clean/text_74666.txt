This new addition of the ACSH criticism sourced from a rebuttal on the PCRMs website seems like more of the same thing  trying way too hard to find a way to insert specialinterest fights into the page  Im not disputing the factual correctness that a group said such and such but I dont believe that this sniping between the groups adds substance to the article  As Slim and Rocket both suggested it seems silly to give lots of page space to the opinions of conflicting lobby groups about other lobby groups  At this point I would oppose having PCRM criticism on ASCHs page and oppose having ASCH criticism on PCRMs page  Its noise in a sea of posturing  Can we keep this article to factual information that originates with reliable sources
