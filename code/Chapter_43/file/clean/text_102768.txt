Bot acting in a way that confuses me 

MrZbot just reported  at AIV because he Tripped filter 139 details  Not sure how this is a problem since the user wasnt able to do anything of vandalism or otherwise problematic because he was prevented from so doing by the filter  Is there a good reason why this would be reported  Not challenging you I just dont know what this is so Id like to understand
