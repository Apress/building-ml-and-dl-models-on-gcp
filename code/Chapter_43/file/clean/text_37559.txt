The link you provided took me to some document which is in Greek There is a picture there but i cannot verify that it belongs to UNPO Then the most updated information is usually taken as the actual information Or should we stick to infos from centuries ago CIA is not the world official source of information I have seen that sometimes it has mistakes and erroneous  information on some countries Anyway i checked it andSurprise this is what i saw
Ethnic groups
TABField info displayed for all countries in alpha order
Albanian 95 Greek 3 other 2 Vlach Roma Gypsy Serb Macedonian Bulgarian 1989 est
note in 1989 other estimates of the Greek population ranged from 1 official Albanian statistics to 12 from a Greek organization
So the percentage is 3 and not 6 like you claim There is no source where it says that it is 6 thus it has to be removed And bringing the claim of a Greek NGO is not reliable I can bring you tens of claims of Albanian and other NGO which claim that Greek population in Albania is smaller than 1 or that ethnic Albanian population in Greece is higher than 15
