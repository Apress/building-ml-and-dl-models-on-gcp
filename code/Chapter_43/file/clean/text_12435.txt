Without going in to the question of whether the company meets Wikipedias notability requirement the reason that the page was deleted is that it was a cut and paste of copyright material Wikipedia cannot accept copyright material and all text on Wikipedia must be able to be released under the GFDL copyleft licence The steps to go through to release the text are noted on your user talk page however as the whole article was lifted directly from the companys website and thus raises issues of neutrality and advertising you might be better off writing something from scratch  making sure of course that the notability requirement is met Best of luck  talk
