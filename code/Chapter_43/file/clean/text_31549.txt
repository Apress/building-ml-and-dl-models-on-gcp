I am not permanently objecting to this change  I would like to hold off a bit until we look at the scholarship on this matter  How do scholars refer to it separation exclusion excommunication or something else  Although we discourage primary sources I am curious about how do both groups refer to this matter in their own literature and whether there has been shifts over time  I will do some initial work on this and present some findings by midweek I apologize but we are in the middle of a national vacation this weekend
