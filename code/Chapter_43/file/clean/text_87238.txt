That was a mistake I didnt mean to change it from Rebbeca I was removing an unnecessary hidden comment  unnecessary because its found in the infobox and doesnt need to be repeated  as well as the citation shouldnt be in both the infobox and the lead  and the way it was done was really stupid I knew that it was in the middle of the name which is bad enough but didnt realize that there were two  breaking the name up in 3 ways

Now let me ask you Why would you revert it back before my edit I hope that was just a mistake on your part There were so many improvements that I made according to MOS and standards
