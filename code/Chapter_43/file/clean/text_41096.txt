Considering that you restored the section except that it didnt mention nazism  youre hardly one to talk And its not political views And calling Sydsvenskan politically affiliated Its a morning paper regional but respected The article wasnt even an editorial but written by a PhD whos written published journal articles about nationalism  
Writing about the marches that has been held on his death day but not mentioning that they for the last 20 or so years has not been much but nazi demonstrations is misleading
