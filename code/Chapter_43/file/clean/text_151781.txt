Sorry but i am rather certain that i have never said that Lindzen is on the fringes There are rational sceptics Lindzen Christy Pielke Sr and there are those who really are out on the fringes Singer Plimer  And their biographies no matter if they have a mainstream minority or a fringe position must be dealt with in the same way per BLP But all of this is a distraction from the issue that i was trying to point at That some of these biographies are being used as a coatrack for describing minorityfringe views that do not fall under biographic material and that BLP is used to circumvent NPOV by not describing the mainstream viewpoint If you describe a minority or fringe viewpoint then you must also describe the mainstream and make sure that the reader is aware of the difference
