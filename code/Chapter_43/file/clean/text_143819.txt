Dear Watson and Christian

All I said was that McFly were a bad band and mentioned that The Daily Mail had published a piece saying Arbeit Macht Frei wasnt such a bad Nazi slogan  Neither of these statements are trolling but the former is subjective and I wouldnt put it in an entry  Christian is always bleating on about people reacting to his own subjective views and to his rightwing assertions  And then he complains to administrators who havent always got the time to look at his history and some of whom seem to enjoy playing god and go way over the top watching carefully so that they can justify blocking poor bastards like me  You must be a bit bored the pair of you  I have a 12 year old daughter  If she does something that I perceive as naughty I dont use it as an excuse a year later to ban her from going out with her friends  I think Watson is trolling me by watching my every move and if I get the time I will be be back on this  Christian asked me to stay off his talk page and I would have done so but didnt get the chance  My Dear Watson just zapped down like Zeus with his thunderbolt  Trolling as I understand it is serious and its not what I am about
