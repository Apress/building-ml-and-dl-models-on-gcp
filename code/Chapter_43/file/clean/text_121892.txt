Mother of Fraternities page
Thank you User 7110615061 for your advisory regarding the above page and your supporting citation It cannot be helped when there is a valid cite for a misattribution there having been four fraternities established at Union some for nearly fifteen years before the first at Miami U consequently I have restored content regarding the use of the term Mother of Fraternities in regard to the latter to the Mother of Fraternities page

A thoughtful word to you as a new user making your very first edit at Wikipedia though it is obviously tempting try not to be too quick to use the Revert button In doing so for example you washed out valuable edits that had been made to the page  Next time you find yourself in such a situation take the time to incorporate the material you believe has been deleted erroneously to the work done by others if any in the interim  Youll find your experience here at Wikipedia and your relationship with other volunteer editors as well as Administrators more satisfying as a result 

Also it is Wikipedia custom and its collective request that users sign any posts they make on pages at the encyclopedia including article and user Talk pages with four tildes the button in the upper left on an English keyboard which translates into a signaturedate stamp as will follow this Yours
