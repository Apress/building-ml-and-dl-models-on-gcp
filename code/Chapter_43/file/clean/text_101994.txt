Moving Article into Mainspace

Hi Brynn Ruth Hannah and Michelle
Just a reminder that since last session you should be moving your edited article into mainspace bit by bit Remember that every time you save an edit you need to write in an edit summary so that I can tell whats happening  so if you are editing the SBNR mainspace article your edit summary should include the phrase moving over edits from sandbox into mainspace And remember you can keep using the Talk Page here to hash out issues of how to move sections over and you can keep using the Talk Page on the SBNR article in the mainspace to hash out issues of where things should go to have conversations with other editors etc
