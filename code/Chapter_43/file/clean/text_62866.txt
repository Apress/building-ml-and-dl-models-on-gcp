The eastern Montana thing is going to be tricky there was a boom just like now in the 70s80s and a subsequent crash the pattern is significant not necessarily a permanent thing Will take proper research to do that bit justice  and if anyone does a shoutout to Sidney but not Miles City Glendive Glasgow or maybe even Baker and Wibaux and of course Ekalaka we will be in all sorts of trouble grin  Plus at the moment with that murder out in Sidney the place is coming under a lot of scrutiny for the boomtown atmosphere and so I suggest we tread delicately  talk 

 Article Structure 

Okay so there seems to be no basic consensus on how this article should be structured  I cant find an outline in the wikiprojects sections so I am going to attempt to make one based on the the only three states at FAClass Minnesota Oklahoma and Virginia and the nearest GAClass article South Dakota  Yes were being beaten by South Dakota  Here is my suggestion 

Etymology  see OKs  Short description of where the name Montana comes from
Geography  see SDs  General descriptions about size and location
Geology and terrain  Junk about east v west mountains rivers etc  Just not a bunch of lists
Flora and fauna  kind of obvious may need to break state into regions  
Climate
Protected lands  State and national parks I guess
History  Summarize and send off to the History of Montana page
American Indian reservations  Brief overview and description of the Indian reservations in Montana  Could be linked here until a separate page can be made
Cities and Towns  See OKs  Briefly describe the makeup of Montanas cities and towns  Not a giant list Theres already one here just send people there  Really only those with more than 50000 should be listed on this page but given that doesnt even include the capital we may as well go down to Kalispell at around 20000 ie the largest seven  No other town even has 10000  Were not exactly waiting up on election night for the Havre votes to come in
Demographics  Basic census crap written in prose
Population
Ancestry
Religion
Economy
Culture  see OKs and VAs
Arts and theatre  We have plenty of museums and theatres across the state  You could list the most important ones first but eventually they need to be put into prose
Festivals and events  Ditto
Sports and recreation
Organized sports  Probably mostly college sports and minor league baseball  Could add state games and skiing competitions I guess
Outdoor recreation  hiking fishing mountain biking skiing etc
Government and politics  see OKs
State government
Local government
Tribal government
National Politics
Education  School districts administration universitiescolleges etc
Media  see OKs and SDs  Links to lists should be okay but here only the largest and prominent should be mentioned as well as Nielsen zones etc
Health  see VAs and OKs  MTs healthcare system stats and perhaps main hospitals
Transportation  see OKs  Basic info from the MDOT on our roads train stations and airports  And the basic health of our transportation system
State symbols  see VAs

Any Comments
  

Thanks for the list Dsetay  you forgot to sign it above No question the article is not of good quality and needs to be improved  I dont have a lot of time to devote to this but Id support and offer minor assistance to an improvement drive The Oklahoma or Minnesota articles would probably be the best guides as both have notable Native American populations and are more or less in the west  SD would be fine to fill in gaps but GA being a less fussy standard than FA Id split any debates in favor of an FA structure  User talkMontanabw
