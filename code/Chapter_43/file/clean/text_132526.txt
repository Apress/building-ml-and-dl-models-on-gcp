By the way this Wiki is set up so users can create articles as one would normally see in an encyclopedia I do not know what you intend IntelliVIEW headerdetail to be but the Wikipedia is not set up for users to host their own specialised wikis as a subset of Wikipedia However you might be interested in setting up a Wiki of your own on your own server if you have one as the Wiki software is available freely to download  1336 19 Mar 2004 UTC
