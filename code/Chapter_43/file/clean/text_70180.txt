Oppose Removal After reading the above comments and looking at some of the users pages it becomes apparent that that deletion is an attempt to silence the oppossition and promote a POV As an American historian I see that there is strong support for gun ownership rights and has there been for centuries Many Americans see this as a valid argument against gun control and in America it is not a fringe theory The article is about Gun Control and one could infer American Gun control because it is no longer an issue in most other countries The argument has legs and to deny that is to deny history for political motivations Whether or not we agree with the argument is irrelevant History is not about voting on current policies The proper thing to due is to have arguments for and against the viewpoint and not to bury it because like a zombie it will rise again Also I am concerned that Wikipedia has become a platform for many editors to promote their politics and I am sure this statement will bring the POV pushers out as an accurate assessment often does Thanks 1725611104
