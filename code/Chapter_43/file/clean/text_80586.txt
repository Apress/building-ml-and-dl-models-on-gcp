Hello Dandv

Due to deletion attempt of another FOSS project we Linux enthusiasts encountered strange criterion of notability So as I see your are familiar with such a inconstancy of WPN and being more familiar with regulations you could advice us about feature of such an initiative to put special guideline for FOSS

Ive just added some strings and new facts here httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaNotabilityRFCNotability_of_free_open_source_software

What should we all do for this page become a guideline

May be we all should gain attention of others wikipedianslinuxenthusiasts to that problem

Thanks in advance
