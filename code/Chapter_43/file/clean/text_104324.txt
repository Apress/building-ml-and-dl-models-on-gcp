But youre predicating the above on a false assumption one I said was one of the things youre accusing me of that fact is I have dealt with the issues Jdchamp raised and done so in the proper forums and intend to continue if I ever see a constructive argument come his way The only extent to which I havent has been me trying to do exactly the same Step back and take a deep breath since Monday thing that youre now arguing I should do I honestly started to wonder if this was my imagination so I just checked Ive even had a healthy discussion on the poll area with Strunke one in which Jdchamp would have been welcome to join in had he had more to say than the I demand administrator intervention You two are working together type accusations hes been making Not that I would have stopped him but the point is that seems to be the level of discussion

Im not going to pretend there arent comments I made very early on that were unhelpful though any reasonable person would have seen them for what they were how was I to know what I was dealing with But nothing I have done rose to the level that your insults against me suggested and absolutely nothing at all nothing period rose to the level that I deserved to have my page vandalized every day with bogus warnings and pseudomakeups

You know Ive been on Wikipedia now for well I guess well over a year now Ive never had anything like this happen to me Ive had robust discussions before I have never ever had a situation where someone was so obsessed with a technical detail that they decided to come to my Talk page and post warnings over and over and over and over again or refused to post in the correct place when asked Perhaps you regularly deal with worse people than that I dont know But I didnt deserve this I reverted something that at the time was against consensus and I did it a grand total of twice I explained my reasons The nearest thing I did at the time that came to being uncivil was pointing out that deliberately making changes against consensus can be seen by many of us as vandalism Whats happened since is ridiculous Im bewildered it happened and Im saddened you still are making the accusations against me that are very obviously not true
