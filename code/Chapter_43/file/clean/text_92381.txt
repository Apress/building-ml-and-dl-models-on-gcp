Reforming Wikipedia is an impossible feat i fail to see positive improvement on articles I find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much The ability for growth is stifled I have seen 99 of Maya books and articles use Ahau instead of Spanish Ajaw yet the editors of Wikipedia like to stand out as different Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way I find thats what happens to words In the 1970s the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray they all say Rah Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language Can hearts of men reform Please prove my doubts they will I think truth is stifled and smothered War exists even without religion because religion is NOT mere organized armies religion is also mere individual political belief or personal concepts of what is true and it will rally people It does right here and in chats and in bulletins Woul not be caught by name on here you all make me shame to be on
