Gold star editors 

I was searching for mention of my name in the user talk namespace and came across User talkWalkermaGold star editors Im honoured to have my name listed there  I try to be diligent to the point of being paranoid about fixing vandalism Im curious though how did you come up with that list I cant imagine going through thousands upon thousands of edits by hand checking for how consistently someone reverted vandalism What kind of things did you measure to find out a persons vandalism reversion consistency 87
