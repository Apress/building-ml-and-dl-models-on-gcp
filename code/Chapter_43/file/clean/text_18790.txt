Rajput is the term or caste introduced much later in the Indian caste system Everyone knows about that and their origin created by Brahmins from Agni chandra and what not because in medieval India they were the rulers and it was the hour of need for Brahmins to bring them into varna system for protection and other reason where as Saini or Shoor sainis are ancient tribe and are Yaduvanshi kshatryas So remove the part that sainis claim to be Rajputs Sainis are Yaduvanshis When Yadu vansh started there was no such caste as Rajput Read the puranas and other history sources So there is no such thing as sainis claiming to be Rajputs Sainis are Yaduvanshis and there is no such thing that sainis claim to be Yaduvanshi it is a fact that sainis are Yaduvanshis Sainis were warriors Also in sikhism sainis played a very important role in the areas of Anandpur sahib and Chamkaur sahib fought for Guru Gobind Singh ji In holy text Guru Garanth sahib ji Saini caste is mentioned as the true friends or sajjan or mitar So Sitush stop creating your own stories Whosoever has problem with sainis as Rajputs please do me a favor and remove the claim to be Rajput part becuase saini is an ancient caste and are Yaduvanshi kshatrya long before Rajputs were taken into Kshatriya fold
