Interestingly Ray Franz writes pg 385386 about several letters he sent to his uncle after being disfellowshipped He says he expected no reply and received none He includes an extract from a letter he sent to him in 1988 as Fred Franz neared death He says he was not surprised he received no reply but was sad nonetheless Im intrigued Fazil about your comment Later on his vitriolic sentimentsbias in his book suggests his disfellowshipping was justified again and proves he is dishonest Ray Franz was certainly critical of the WTS in his book although vitriol seems too harsh a word The overall tone of the book is concern and sadness but if you have read the book you are free to make your own judgment But what dishonesty are you referring to and what is it in his book that proves he was dishonest Willietell makes a claim based on local gossip that Franz lied about why he disassociated  though all the evidence points to Franz being right and Willietell being wrong  but I know of no other allegations that Franz was dishonest Throughout his time in and then out of the organization he was revered as a man of strong principle  which of course was the reason he decided he could no longer remain on the Governing Body or in the religion
