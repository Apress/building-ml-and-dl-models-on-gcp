Creating a page question 

Greetings I have a quick question I have noticed you have created a lot of pages so I figured you may be a good person to ask Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 is the first article I have created Before I added the content it was a Redirect page My question is will that count as a created page in my statistics I know from experience that creating a redirect page doesnt count and even after creating this article my created pages number is still zero I was just wondering who gets the credit of creating an article that was originally a redirect Thanks for the help
