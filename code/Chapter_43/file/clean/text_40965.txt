Well Christians worship a man that has been dead 2000 years It isnt true that Selassie denied association with the movement he remained dissassociated with it but that is something entirely different His primary duty was to his Ethiopian subjects because his job was to be Emperor and he couldnt have abandoned that to become a cult leader and if he had the Ratsa s would have lost faith in HIM I dont think a desire to smoke weed is what makes a Rasta there are for more weed smokers than Rastas in the world who feel no need to be Rastas or for the most part justify there use of weed More importantly Rasta is so much more than smoking weed as Christianity is so much more than drinking wine So I would guess from your comments that you dont understand where Rasta is coming from
