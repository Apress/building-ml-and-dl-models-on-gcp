Edicts from above are a growing concern for those who believe Wikipedia should be what it purports itself to be in newspapers magazines and to new members a community of editors As a community we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers Would you be interested in starting andor promoting a WikipediaNo confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV

In such an area any editor could call for a show of support or noconfidence for an administrator or higher People would sign for either support or noconfidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus Please feel free to start or add to WikipediaNo confidence and to duplicate this message or tell other editors who want to see Wikipedia succeed KIMP spewage
