Two out of three isnt a very large majority  The person who said in their Edit Summary that Irv Kupcinet was superfamous and known to every American is showing POV  If his newspaper column was syndicated to 100 newspapers as the person Wildhartlivie claimed thats leaving out many cities and towns  I checked all three of the newspapers that existed in Washington DC at the time Karyn died and none of them carried Kups column  People in DC couldnt watch his TV talk show either  It wasnt listed in the local TV guide  If a celebrity wasnt in Washington DC in 1963 then heshe wasnt in a lot of places  Same goes for Raleigh North Carolina  I checked the News  Observer in 1963  No Kups column  Other good sources are people who were over the age of 18 living in DC and Raleigh in 1963  Ive talked with them and they say they never heard of Irv Kupcinet until I told them about Karyns death

I already named the Raleigh newspaper  If you insist DC people did indeed know about and care about Irv Kupcinet at the time his daughter died then please name all three DC newspapers from that period
