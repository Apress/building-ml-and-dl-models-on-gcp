Honestly I dont know the source but this is true  When we are performing missions for agencies companies individuals or whatever anything outside the Air Force Air National Guard and related subsidiaries we are just considered a corporation  Many pilots have been buying unofficial patches with the words Aux On  Aux Off see the patch and examples here  Basically when we operate for the Air Force family we are a US Code Title 10 organization when we operate outside of the Air Force we are a US Code Title 36 organization  IIRC this is a situation thats been on the books for a while but only recently recognized by the community at large   T    C
