The article looks well on its way now but yes Ill certainly be supporting in a day or two I just want to read it through again to see if anything leaps out at me

Ill mention one thing thats niggled at me for a while which is if its possible to be as it were more precise about the ambiguities of the Bandonly tracks in the lead text of the Columbia Records compilation section For instance it states According to Fraboni four new songs by the Band were also recorded in preparation for the albums official release one of which a cover of Chuck Berrys Going Back to Memphis did not end up being included I wonder if something like this should be added However there is no scholarly consensus that the three songs on the album Fraboni says were recorded in 1975Bessie Smith Aint No More Cane and Dont Ya Tell Henrywere in fact recorded then On the other hand it seems far more likely to me that FraboniGriffin is right than Bowman so I dunno
