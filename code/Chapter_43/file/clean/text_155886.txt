A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discussargue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation  For all I know I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented mind gameplaying geek living in inner Mongolia  It is imperative in my mind that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence as I have of their actual ability credibility reliability accountability  their authority to control  If its required of the sources it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them  Similarly how do I call for consensus  Who may be a member and how is each identified  Thanks in advance    

 Thats the beauty of Wikipedia Anyone can edit it Thats the point You have no more authority than any other editor here regardless of your credentials Also anyone can participate when trying to achieve consensus Just remember its not the number of people but the strength or the arguments that matter darian
