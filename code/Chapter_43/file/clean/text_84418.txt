I do apologize once more to you for my unkind insult As is traditional among IrishAmericans in Boston on Saint Patricks Day I got myself rather seriously intoxicated that evening which is a lousy excuse as I edit drunk not all that infrequently but having suffered an unexpected and tragic death in my family on Monday I was additionally distressed and upset more than I had fully realized As such I beg you not to take my lashing out personally as I was simply suffering an incoherent rage which could have ended up being directed at anyone Again I am deeply sorry  talk
