Theres something else to keep in mind  as with all people with social problems he lets things linger and carry over and use it as an excuse a long time down the road  he remembers from a few months ago how I didnt let him intimidate me THEN and now he is still trying to do it so since hes realized that after 2 months Im STILL not allowing him to intimidate me he cant stand it and he lashes out
Hes going to be embarrased at that other page  the admins are going to see through his BS and realize that for the first time this is someone whos standing up to him Hes not tough
