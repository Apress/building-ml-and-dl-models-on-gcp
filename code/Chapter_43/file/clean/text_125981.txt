I apologize if my comment was worded poorly All I meant to imply was that no one could possibly confuse the levelheaded Chadbryant of Wikipedia with the quarrelsome and obnoxious Chad Bryant of recsportprowrestling This Chad Bryant is obviously and unequivocally unrelated to Chadbryant most likely created by a nemesis of Chadbryant with the purpose of reflecting badly upon him in the eyes of Wikipedians Cheers
