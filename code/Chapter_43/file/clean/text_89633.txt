Sources and multiple accounts
Everything you place in a Wikipedia article needs a source some reliable book or website that supports what you say The material you are adding to the Curacao article seems to be correct but without a source it will be removed Can you point me at a place to verify your information I can read Dutch well and can handle Papiamentu if I have to Im slow at it

I also note that you have been editing at Curable8 and Curable88 Tell me which one is the right one and I will block the wrong one You cant use two accounts to edit on the same article
