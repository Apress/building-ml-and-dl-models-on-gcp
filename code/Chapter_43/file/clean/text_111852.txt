Pl and Jim you two tend to forget that there are others watching and monitoring your own edits and comments as well There is little positive about your contributions Peter nor your hateful comments Jim People can read and I dont consider either of you honest scholars or editors Your own words and your edits are being scrutinized So is your lack of good faith among other failures to be balanced kind and true to history So keep up the very bad work on Nostradamus that both of you continue to do such as proclaiming that he is not an astrologer Even a child who has read anything about the author of Les Propheties knows Michel Nostradamus was an astrologer  except Peter Lemesurier and Jiim62sch  who profess to be the KEY to all things known about Nostradamus but who cannot even read a simple horoscope nor chart of the celestial bodies Perhaps this accounts for your bad translations and even worse biographical knowledge of Nostradamus of course called an astrophile because he practiced astrology as a hobby Great work PL but it doesnt hold water Word has been out on Peter Lemesurier for years about his lack of astrological knowledge and even less on Nostradamus and most scholars avoid his work because of the errors and poor scholarship to boot This reflects even on the Germanversion of Nostradamus which PL has edited One of the worst cases of scholarship on an encyclopedia on this subject which is why he keeps putting out numerous books on Nostradamus Why is this Is not one enough since he knows so much
