Warning

When people have moved on to other things and are going on about their business on wiki in an exemplary fashion do not try and disrupt the peace by gross incivility after many days This is antithetical to the aims of wiki and will work against wiki Also it shows how some people are unable to let go of the old settled dead past and hold silly grudges and not remain peaceful Also I assume that others have assumed good faith about you and let you go on about your business in a normal fashion even though you HAVE been blocked for civility issues among other things before You should learn from them and give that benefit to others too
