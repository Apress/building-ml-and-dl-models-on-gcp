UserJimWae the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version is for the most part incorrect and furthermore you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the propagating atheism you would find that it is a factual statement And once again this article is not about state atheism exclusively but about the ideology of militant atheism which was applied to some atheist states an atheist state could exist without promoting militant atheism Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application which parallels the structure of the article namely the headings listed in the articles table of contents Furthermore contrary to your opinion militant atheism is an integral part of MarxismLeninism as supported by the consequent references For example Faith and Order The Reconciliation of Law and Religion specifically states  When discussing content you must keep in mind WPRS rather than your original research You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason it should be removed from the paragraph That argument does not hold any water whatsoever as this is an encylop√¶dia Moreover removing the information on the concept of militant atheism the Cultural Revolution French Revolution and political thinkers violates WPLEDE which states The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article Your revision of the introduction fails to do this If the term Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not as common however I would not mind compromising and changing it to just Cultural Revolution Rather than constructing a new version I would consider suggesting some alterations to the compromise version I suggested which has addressed the concerns of several people here I have found your arguments regarding the dates compelling and have removed that statement from the compromise version of the introduction I hope this helps With regards Talk
