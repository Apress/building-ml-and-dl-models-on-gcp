First sighting 

I dont know anything about the first sighting of the Angel Falls who what when or where However it looks like the first sighting has been attributed to a westerner an assertion that seems impossible Would it be more correct to say that the first Westerner sighting of the falls was Mr Sanchez not that he was the first to see it Its like saying Columbus discovered the New World
