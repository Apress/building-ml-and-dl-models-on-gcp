About the Adrian Ettlinger Article 

Hi Mr Ettlinger

your thanks notification regarding my edit to the Adrian Ettlinger article whom I believe is about your late father is appreciated Im not quite sure what is how a notification is better than an edit to the user talk page but I still appreciate it I tried to reach you on Twitter see my tweets in this conversation but I dont appear to have got a reply Im glad to see youre on the Wikipedia as well Im sorry for the loss of your father

In any case my name is Shlomi Fish UserShlomif and Im an Israeli software developer and writer born in 1977 who was introduced to your father when I initiated a successful attempt to integrate my solver for Freecell into the Freecell Pro program that he originated and still maintained back then and we ended up exchanging several hundreds of Emails and became friends and later continued discussing various topics after the technical goal was achieved I still kept most of the Email messages from him although Im not sure I have all of my own replies and was sorry to have learned about him passing away which I did after doing a web search by accident

Anyway Id like to post some of the Emails he sent me or at least selected parts thereof as a way to commemorate him but they may need to be filtered to avoid speaking against him and other people he also told me about his family children grandchildren etc and friends I also want to translate from Hebrew to English a story I originally wrote about my Internet relationship with Adrian see this link  not sure what Google Translate and similar services can make of it for now for an online Israeli story contest for the Software Freedom Day which had a focus on open source software development I dont think I hoped to win but I wanted to do my share for the event The story was written back when Adrian was still alive and we exchanged Emails for several years after that

Ill appreciate it if you can return to me and sorry for this being so long you may be quite busy Im sorry again for your loss
