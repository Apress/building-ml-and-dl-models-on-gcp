I appreciate the support  I have added this item to WPBLPN per the instructions found in WikipediaBLPRemove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_contentious_material rather than attempting to handle the problem myself  I note that this same reference is being used to include content above as well and so will apply to that content as well

Clearly it will be impossible for me to prove a negative ie that no such verification exists nor should I even have to attempt to do so since per per WikipediaVerifiabilityBurden_of_evidence that The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material

It is also clear by simple googling that this particular reference is becoming detrimental to the reputation of Wikipedia itself as I can find numerous sources that refer to this exact page and this exact topic
