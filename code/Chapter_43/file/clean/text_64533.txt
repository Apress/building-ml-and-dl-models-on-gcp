My RFA 

You cannot know all rules by heart but you should be able to make yourself familiar with them if needed

I had never heard the most basic rule worded that way  but I thought it was very nice  Thank you for voting on my RFA It was unsuccessful but I am nevertheless grateful for your support I hope to see you around the wikiUser_talkDanielfolsomfolsom 
You are welcome I am sorry to hear that it has failed There are really not enough people who want to face the RfAchallenge and who would be great admins but fail over such trivialties I hope you will not stop making great contributions And if you liked my little piece of philosophy check my main user page I got more of it  Why
