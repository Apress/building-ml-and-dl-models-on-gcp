Come and Hear
JFW removed the link but I think this warrants a bit more discussion Despite it being an antiJewish website unfortunately THIS particular website also happens to be an important resource as Im not aware of any other site of the net that has parts of the Talmud online yes theres Rodkinson but I think his version is spurious and anyway the tractates are quite different in the two resources Wikipedia pages have links to POV websites all the time including very biased or deplorable ones I think that it should be put back in while its the only site with a large proportion of Soncino in English online Counterarguments shall be much appreciated  1148 16 Dec 2004 UTC
