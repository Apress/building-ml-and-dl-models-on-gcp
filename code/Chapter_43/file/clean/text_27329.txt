Soundsoundtrack
i request you respond to the issue i brought up at the moment music and soundtrack should share the same information as they are both related to the music of Ghost in the Shell film It something that needs to be addressed for GA the current soundtrack section is merely a track listing and infobox Not only that but some review information of the music is in the music subsection of production which is not relevant towards it I still believe merging the two is the best choice
