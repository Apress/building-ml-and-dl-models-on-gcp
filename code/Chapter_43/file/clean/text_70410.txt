Wayne Morrin 

The oner spelling is not an implausible typo firstly the article was created at that spelling in 2007 while the doubler spelling didnt exist until you created it a week ago Secondly 197677 Calgary Cowboys season and List of BlazersCowboys players both link to the singler spelling by having it deleted you broke an existing link Thirdly several other references  this one for example and this one  do spell it with one r And fourthly just on principle alone Morin is far more plausible than Morrin just because its a far more common surname to begin with

With conflicting sources its certainly best that we dont get into a move war over it pending some kind of confirmation But the oner spelling at the very least isnt implausible enough to warrant deletion in the meantime
