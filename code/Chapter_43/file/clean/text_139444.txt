Red line I retire from this mediation and anything in relation with the article 

I have been witchhunted impunely and got a probably very unjust block I just cannot discuss in such conditions 

I have tried to be constructive pedagogic dialogant but all is useless So guess that in the end after a couple more editors have been displaced Thulean will write the article alone 

Of course I guess someone will come later and just nuke it because its ultraPOV but in any case it will be someone else 

Im done with defending NPOV and the spirit of Wikipedia in this article
