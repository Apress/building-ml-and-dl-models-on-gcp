Having been born in Belfast and having lived in Bangor Northern Ireland for many years I counted the number of towns in North America with these names This was a few years ago now but I seem to remember there having been something like 13 towns in the USA called Bangor and about 6 towns called Belfast With the large number of ScotsIrish and IrishAmericans in the USA would it be surprising if this town wasnt named after the town of Bangor located in Northern Ireland The only tune I can think of that mentions Bangor refers to the town in Wales Either way perhaps one of these towns deserves mention in the article
