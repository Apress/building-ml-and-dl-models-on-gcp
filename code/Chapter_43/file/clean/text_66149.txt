I need your help 

Dear Luna Santin

First of all I want to say you are the only administrator that has shown any respect to me and for that I come to ask that you help me overcome this outstanding prejudice directed toward myself by the many pompous admins that continue to block me and harass me unfairly While I have made mistakes in the past I assure you I am committed to only contributing to wikipedia 

I am angry because the last time I was blocked was completely unfair I was issued a warning because I posted I love you on two users talk pages While they took this as a joke I took it as my try to make peace with these people that i felt wronged me in the past Im sorry if love is considered a joke around here While I tried explaining that I should not be warned for something like this they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me instead of being responsible admins As a result they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week While on this ban they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet because this user claimed he was me in an edit Everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit Since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine they extended the block to 1 month to further keep me quiet I obviously finding this as unfair decided to request an unblock because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block Since this was a way of me speaking out they rejected and even protected my page which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it 

I hope you can get back to me and really help me out I feel mistreated and as a person that cannot stand unjust people and a person that fights for what is right I want to fight this so that this whole mishap is solved If you can help in any way that would be appreciated I know that I might even get blocked again for writing this letter since it involves me speaking out against the almighty admins even though what I am speaking out against is wrong

Thank you
