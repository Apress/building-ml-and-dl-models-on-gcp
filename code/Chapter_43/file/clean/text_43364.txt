unblock Although they may be in ill taste to some the facetious comments were by mutual consent if this infringed upon the rules it was by ignorance and not intentional malice all comments were supposed to be humourous although this sense of humour is obviously exclusive to some and not others Please appreciate that clinical text cannot convey true emotion or intent as a voice can I appreciate that to someone not aware of the situation it may seem like flaming the origins of the banter can be seen at Talk Ganon This is purely a misunderstanding of context and should be resolved Although there was a disagreement between myself and LttP I do not believe it was an argument and the proceeding comments were again supposed to be humourous but obviously in ill taste As seen on the Talk Ashnard I offered to delete the offensive comments I also offered to LttP that he could remove the harrassment comments To truely understand what I am saying I suggest you view the origins of discussion at both Talk Ganondorf and Talk Ashnard Thank you
