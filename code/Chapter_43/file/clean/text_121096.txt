Poorly written sentence 

The fight broke out around 200 am local time between two cell blocks of a high security portion of the jail

This sentence is poorly written   Does it mean  that the fight took place on the ground between two buildings   Or does it mean that the fight was between the inmates of one building and the inmates of the other building
