Dear Sir
Mr Watson I agree with you completely I will go back and cite book and page number and in the documentary the time stamp where the claim is presented regarding Warner Brothers illogical thinking at the time I have no doubt that today Warner Bros and all of the world respects and regards Bruce in a much better way than it did in 1973 or in 1978 when Linda Lees book on her late husband was first published we have grown closer with more understanding in  and less bigotry in the civilised parts of our world

Regards of warmth and respect for a chance to practice my American English grammar and being so kind in my edits out of the sand box

Cathie
