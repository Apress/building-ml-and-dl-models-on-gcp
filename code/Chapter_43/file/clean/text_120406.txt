I dunno In a completely different sport of American football would you consider the first winner of the Heisman Trophy Jay Berwanger removed from CategoryAmerican football running backs for he didnt play football again after he graduated Plus if you remove the different FAs in the Filipino footy categories most of those which are left are essentially extensions of the varsity teams For example Diliman FC are for UP Fighting Maroons alumni same for Mendiola United FC and the San Beda Red Lions Most players of the national team are varsity team players
If wed go through your example no Filipino footballer would be included in that category unless he played outside the Philippines  the Duck
