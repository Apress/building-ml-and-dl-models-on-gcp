Not really requesting an unblock because Im not sure theres any point to continue editing Wikipedia if the winners in disputes are the ones who are pushing a yearslong agenda and manipulating content so that it reads as defamatory as possible without any corroborating documentation besides ArchiveorgOregon website and the losers are those who do all the hard work to expose the manipulators who are themselves socking themselves lying  I merely hope that one of the other editors operating in the right will bring this tagteam to the Administrators Noticeboard because the chicanery needs to stop
