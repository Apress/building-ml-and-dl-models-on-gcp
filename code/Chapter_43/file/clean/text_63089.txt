Your uncivil tone notwithstanding I love being proved wrong so please take this to WikipediaDeletion review  IF you have a problem with my resolution please submit to the appropriate forum on WikipediaAdministrators noticeboard

Regarding my decision the concepts you were trying to present exist in the books article greater expounding does not in my good faith search exist in any documented form that conforms to our expectations such as found at WPV and WPRS  Again if you disagree I encourage you to use the forums outlets available to you  My closure was a nonadmin closure   talk 

Bollocks That was an administrative action That this is verifiable is admitted by you redirecting it to an article about a book covering it  Wolfkeeper Talk 

Deletion is administrative Redirection is not inherently so and is most often executed by nonadministrators  That book poorly referenced itself as being notable enough for inclusion is barely enough to address such an obscure presentation  100000 greater clarity is required to make any sense of the topic as it is   talk 

No I just checked The policy clearly says you cant comment and close it even if youre not using admin priviledges  Wolfkeeper Talk 

I repeat who the hell do you think you are  Wolfkeeper Talk
