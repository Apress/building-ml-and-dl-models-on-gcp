Questions about the Belarusian position
Im not quite sure about Belarusian ethnic lands  could you be more specifi because we do have opinions that it was Lithuanian ethnic land and also that it was Polish ethic lands If the territory is defined by Russian Empire state sponsored linguist Karsky theories it is no wonder indeed especially knowing there are no Lithuanians stance taken by that state We could discuss this at someplace else as this is very complex issue
Further  as far I do remember Belarusian Rada of BPR did recognize Lithuanias Republic rights to Vilnius and Gardinas It was contemporary decision it might have changed later
