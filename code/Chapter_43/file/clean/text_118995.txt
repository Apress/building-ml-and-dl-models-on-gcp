Jimmy Wales

I am not sure that reopening the AfD as a joke is a good idea A new editor came to the article tonight She has mostly contribs to one article that was nominated for an AfD that I helped save Well she started modifying the dates on his article which go contrary to Jimbos expressed statement Now another user has followed and done the same I have made reverts but dont want it to appear I am editwarring I did not issue a warning on the first change as I viewed it as a good faith edit Then the new user reeditted the article again I reverted and issued her a warning She continued to revert and I issued another warning along with 3RR advice She had the nerve to put a 3RR nonsubstituted warning on my talkpage Id be willing to bet that his DOB will be editwarred over if the AfD is opened as a joke What do you think
