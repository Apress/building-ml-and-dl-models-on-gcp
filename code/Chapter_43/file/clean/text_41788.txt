Thanks for your attempt at words of wisdom But I have been contributing in a major way on many articles for longer than a meager year Some edits were contributed prior to my adopted username I am the primary editor on the Soil article which I completely rewrote and to which I added to major effect It is interesting how these blocks seem to come as a cascading event with increasing rapidity as time advances Doesnt suprise me and that such an event has not been noticed by the zombies at WP admin would not surprise me either as the trolls and the admins are really just birds of a feather Birds of a feather really And what is more they seem to prefer to put people on trial in their kangaroo courts They really have no interest in improving the situation I really have no interest whatsoever in joining in with these trolls and learning their rules but thanks much for the advice
