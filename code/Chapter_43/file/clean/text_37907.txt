Are you sure Im wrong  I spoke with a professor who is a linquistic expert and she said that Nones from the Val di Non is a Ladin language  Wouldnt that make sense that there is a language of this region that predates the Germans coming in or the introduction of Italian as the national language of Italy  From my own experience what they call Nones or Ladin or Romansch all are very similar  Of course not exactly the same but you know as well as I do that these old language change just going from one valley to another valley
