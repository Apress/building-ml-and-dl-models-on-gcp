And  wouldnt say that I love ferrets exactly any more than Id say that I love cats or dogs I love individual ferrets cats or dogs but ferrets have many unappreciated good qualities and theyve had a consistently bad press for far too long Theyre domesticated animals and they deserve our respect and friendship So if anyone visits they have to be prepared for the possibility that theyll be kissed and licked by little furry animals with big teeth which they might previously have thought of as being nasty bitey and smelly Seems to have worked so far as theres tumbleweed blowing down the drive now lol   Fatuorum
