Oppose Unmerge I think some of the editors are missing the point of how an encyclopaedia deals with fictional characters and indeed real people The fact is that Darth Vader and Skywalker are the same character one character cannot have two articles if so why stop at two Why not have one for ever emotional stageidentity of the characters life Why dont we do this for all fictional characters Heck why not do it for real people too We could have a page for George W Bush student George W Bush governor George W Bush president and George W Bush postpresidency One characterperson One article the developments of the character in the canon is irrelevant this isnt a fictional encyclopaedia which pretends the Star Wars universe is real but an encyclopaedia of fact which contains an entry for a fictional character and their impact upon film and popular culture the canon identitystory of the character is actually secondary to that   1935 2 January 2011
