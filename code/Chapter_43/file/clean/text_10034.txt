Alinor the author Elior Levy is the only person in the YNet piece who even employed the term declaration The term unilateral does not appear in the YNet piece and the Eurasia Review article doesnt mention a unilateral declaration at all I notice that you quoted an editorial comment from Amira Hess the other day as if she were the spokesperson of the Palestinian government Now you are quoting Elior Levy instead of the Palestinian who was interviewed The use of the term unilateral in article talk space when neither source mentions that word wasnt bordering on WPCRYSTAL Its was over the line WPSynth
