Your report of vandalism 

Thank you for posting at Wikipedia talkQuestions but the proper place to ask questions is our help desk  With regard to vandalism normally this is quickly fixed  the best thing to do if you do not know how to fix it properly is probably to come back to the article in five or ten minutes and see if the vandalism is gone  If not then you should report the problem at the help desk
