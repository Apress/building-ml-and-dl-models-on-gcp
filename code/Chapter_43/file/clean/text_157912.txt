I will deal with your input above but desist from calling me by that name I understand youve been doing this on other sites in the Wikipedia system You are a frustrated man and I think we should meet to discuss this problem you have with me as Pakhtun Tanoli Is it because other Pakhtuns have been challenging you after my contributions to the debate regarding Pakhtun status of Tanolis Youve have been peddling this name about on different sites in Wikipedia and Ive left it for proud Pakhtuns and others to challenge you Get it into your ignorant head that Tanolis are Pakhtuns and Janjuas are kasbis I know at least 3 families of Janjua origin who do not claim to rajputs but say they are of Maliyar caste None of the historical sources link them with rajputs Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara in Manakraiand they are not rajputs either  read about Raja of Mahmoodabad Moreover the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity the term raja is reserved for the rulers As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat Gujjar and the socalled rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along DarbareAkbari TuzukeJahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara and more importantly from real Rajputs as well 

I accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis We know who the gujjar families are in Tanawal and they do not use Tanoli for themselves though they do say they reside in Tnawal Other Gujjars in Hazara are either settled or are move about between Swat Upper hazara and Azad Kashmir

Additionally you seem to be on a mission to prove something that is not proveable I know you are in the UK and I can meet you face to face to discuss this if you prefer We can sort a number of things relevant to this debate as well as you can know who I really am
