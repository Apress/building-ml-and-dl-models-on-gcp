Elonka I was expecting it to be selfevident that someone involved in a dispute over a particular policy should avoid editing the very policy on which they are to be measured  As you yourself told Jehochman  it is highly questionable behavior to edit an article to which one has such a significant dispute resolution COI  Id say a key policy by which desysoppings are judged by adminship is a No Go area for someone who just finished a recall process and has an RFAR pending for things related to adminship and recall
 
In any event I stand by my UNDO your edit changed the order in such a way as to move the parts on removal for abuse and emphasis on community involvement to the bottom and the parts on uncontroversial desysopping to the top  You should know that WPRECALLME is at best an essay even though it is not tagged and WPADMIN is an official policy usually we work by consensus with such things and discuss radical changes before doing them  Two people talking at a random user subpage does not appear to fit that bill  Happy editing  talk
