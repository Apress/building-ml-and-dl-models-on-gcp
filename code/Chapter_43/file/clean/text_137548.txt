BBC did indeed release its list of Top 100 based on 30000 respondents 

BBCs numerical rankings of the 100 apparently werent disclosed until after the poll was rather heavily flogged in a series of broadcasts in which each of the Top 10 were advocated by various celebritiesauthoritiescommentators and during which time a vastly larger number of voters called in 

I seem to remember the final number on order of 130000 Whether or how this affected final rankings is apparently unknown Obviously these people were if nothing else in some degree TV fans

The Wikipedia article seems to fully accept the validity of the BBC poll which was not at all focused on Scott Further the article implies to me that the poll revealed a decline over time in Scotts popularity with the British Public 

Seems like a reasonable thesis but without comparable polling data from previous periods this is not more than interesting speculation on the part of whatever author is cited

For deep background Wikipedia itself has a number of nonfeatured articles that are somewhat relevant with regard to the rather complex topic of polling including sampling error margin of error  tracking poll straw poll and various other topics 
Im certainly uninformed
