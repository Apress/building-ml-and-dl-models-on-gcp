Hello 

Hey Fuhghettaboutit  As the wisest admin Ive encountered here I need your advice again since I know it will fair and wellanswered  I started my first SPI here way back on May 23 concerning socking by a communitybanned editor all the editors responding in the report are very familiar with her  A CU was performed and a couple of socks were blocked but its now a WPDUCK situation to prove its SRQ  An ANI discussion was started here and the subsequent section is so far 81 in favor of an indefinite ban for socking by this extremely WPTEDIOUS editor  

My question is simple is it WPCANVASSing to notify the other editors who voted to community ban SRQ it was 160 and would have been 170 if I was able to vote at that time of the ANI discussionvote  I would ask only for their attention because of their previous involvement in the ban vote for or against but none were against and invite them to voice whatever opinion they might have  I know SPIs can take a while but my experience with this editor along with the others involved leaves absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was aDeliberate disruptive socking by the banned editor and bThat the ban should be extended to indefinite as a result  I want to close this case as it is dragging on and totally obvious  I appreciate any advice you can give me in this matter  Cheers
