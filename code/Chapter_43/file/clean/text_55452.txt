You need to explain why We Belong Together is a universal love anthem if you want to use that phrase 

Once the studio session was complete confident that the album was complete sounds repetitious 

Also The composers experienced a lengthy discussion is an odd phrasing Maybe it would be better to say Carey and Dupri discussed the melody at length or words to that effect I dont think thats quite the sense that the original phrase is trying to convey though  FreplySpang 
You might be right Im going to certainly correct the third and fourth examples but I dont understand why the second example requires elaboration   talk 21
