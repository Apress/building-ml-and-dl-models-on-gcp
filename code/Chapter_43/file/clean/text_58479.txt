PROBLEMS ON KURDISH ARTICLES

First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran but is not sanctioned publicly Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran Need I remind you all that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria Iraq and Turkey  
It is usually Israeli sources with increasing American and British help and aid that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag which fly the PanIranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan is prohibited in Iran FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES 

Furthermore I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians Serbs Poles and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples Israel the USA and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines This is called balkanisation The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan

Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language history culture identity and genetics I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds 

As I was told by a Kurdish professor Mr Eskandari in Tehran Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the main ancestors of the Kurds the Mede who established Iran as an empire One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian Persians are Iranian but all Iranians like the Kurds and Ossetians are not Persians

The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds but not the only group just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians but not the only ancestors Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs Mongols and other Iranian peoples 

I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were Mountain Turks and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity This is due to geostrategic schemes These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian The covert foreign policy of Israel Britain and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture
