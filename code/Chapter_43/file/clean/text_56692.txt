Events dont need titles
There is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme  Before the video footage is broadcast often there is theme music and an elaborate title page that might say Crisis in Canada or Terror in Iraq  Is it subtle POV to have to label every event with a title

Who called this 2007 Algiers bombings  Obviously we have to use words  Until there is a common name for an event I think we should try to avoid titles whenever possible

This is not a big deal but just a thought that we should always consider
