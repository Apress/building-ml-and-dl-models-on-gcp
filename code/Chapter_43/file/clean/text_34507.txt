The longest response Ive ever had from you  For once actually helpful and had you done that originally I would probably have responded differently  Did you also note the comment above John from myself

For now Ive reverted to the previous consensus presenting both sides I suggest that in line with the guidelines on disputed articles that a discussion takes place before edits  

 The edit I presented took everything back to the consensus view point before everyone had gotten all excited and the people involved were happy  The words might have been different but the sentiment was there  As noted by Red Hat above it was a selfrevert

 So are you going to keep your promise and leave a message in my block log
