While I take your recommendation to heart I have to insist that by any plain reading of WPNFCC1 the image is keepable  Lets look at the test in NFCC 1  evaluate this image
Nonfree content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose
No free equivalent could be created to show what Berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at 16 or so no matter how we approach him as a 22yearold antichild pornography speaker  educator  
If nonfree content can be transformed into free material this is done instead of using a fairuse defense
The only way I could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask Berry to permit its release under GFDL  Permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be to my mind cruel even to ask Berry about it
Nonfree content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available Acceptable quality means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose
There is no freer equivalent available  Berry will never be a teenager again and since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent  more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think
As a quick test ask yourself Can this image be replaced by a different one while still having the same effect If the answer is yes then the image probably does not meet this criterion
As the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time  It is intrinsically true that Berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites  The only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the facts  Berrys image then  and let the reader draw their own conclusion  
What say you
