Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 

Please refrain from your falsifications ragarding photographs of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn suppsedly being searched at a checkpoint in Ekibastuz particularly in this photograph  It is well known that this picture was not taken at Ekibastuz and that the man searching Solzhenitsyn is his companion in fact it says so in the caption of the book this was taken from  I know false photographs lies and propaganda are a popular method for attacking the Soviet Union on Wikipedia but  am not going to allow you to spread your lies and distortions especially with evasive edit summaries such as grammar to make this seem like a real photograph other than a reenactment
