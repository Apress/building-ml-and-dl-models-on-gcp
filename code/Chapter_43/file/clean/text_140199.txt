I feel like only coloring half isnt telling the whole story How about a lighter shade of reddishbrown eg Zinnwaldite as the back I dont like the idea of highlighting all four in green cant tell the difference between winners and losers if all the same colorwhy color at all Alternatively I like the idea of the top two those who advance in a light color Perhaps we could have the top two in green and then bold the last match eg if Sweden won their last match their total in the W column would be bold
