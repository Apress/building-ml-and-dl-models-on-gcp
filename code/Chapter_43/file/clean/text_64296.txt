The article on Morphological analysis needs an overhaul 

The article on Morphological analysis started out as a relatively simple reference to Zwickys ideas a definition of the process a few references and some external links I did not initiate this but whoever did referred to me and the Swedish Morphological Society This was fine with me I went in and added a few details which I though relevant to the subject but more or less left things as they were

Then a Mr I Tjahyo Sarwono came along with some very complicated diagrams rather poor English misinterpretations and explicit errors a parameter he mistakenly calls a value and a value he calls a parameter I am in despair over this as I dont want morphological analysis to get a bad name because of a sloppy Wikipedia article I would like to go in and give the article a major overhaul  but I dont know what the policy is about throwing out other contributors texts and diagrams Can you give me some council on this
