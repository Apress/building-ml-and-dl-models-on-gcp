Hi Hamaryns Please dont change typewriter quotes to curly quotes as you did here

 The exclusive use of straight quotes and apostrophes is recommended 
 When either of two styles are acceptable it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change
