The definition for Fundamental Attribution Error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the termspsychology that is included in the definition I would maybe replace words like attributor and add examples after both situational factors and dispositional factors ie situational factors such as luck 
Compared to the Fundamental Attribution Error definition that was provided in quotes the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow though social perceiver may have the same problem as attributor did like I mentioned above Maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words ie change social perceiver  how an individual would be able to take in information to explain events 
Instead of a in the real world I would use to one instance of this would be in order to have more of an encyclopedic style
Using their instead of hisher before personality may be better as well followed by in which the individual is interacting instead of heshe is acting This would go well with the next section where individual and their is used in the place of heshe and hisher 
Overall I thought that this was a really interesting article and I think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples I really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate Aside from the few things that Ive mentioned I think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting
