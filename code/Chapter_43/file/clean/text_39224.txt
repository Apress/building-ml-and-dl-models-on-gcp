PS the ㅂirregular inflections section didnt come from the Japanese article however it was still translated from some material calling them ㅂ変格用言 in Japanese so if you could think of a better English name than something weirdsounding like ㅂirregular inflected word itd be great  As an aside Ive always thought the real irregular verbs in Japanese are those funky obsolete ones marked 特別活用 in dictionaries
