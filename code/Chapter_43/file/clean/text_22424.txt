Cab Rider Vignette
On coming to Westport once by train  there were few cabs around 
and I shared a cab ride with Sandy Dennis the cab dropping her off 
at her home first And continuing on to my inlaws in Westport

She was at the time in some broadway play 

And in a continuing romantic lilt over several years I sent to the theatre not once but 56 times dozens of roses signed simply cab rider  as I liked her right away 

She never knew who the cab rider was
