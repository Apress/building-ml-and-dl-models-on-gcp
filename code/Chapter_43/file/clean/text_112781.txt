Compensation 
I believe that the compensation section should include details about whether the compensation mentioned is per month or annual and it should also mention the source I am unable to find the info so the person who first created the section please help   

Vajpayee remains PM till new pm is asked to form a government   is this accurate  All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president This is not possible e 

He did in fact resign and the president did accept it However as is custom the president asked him to continue in office til alternative arrangements are made The Hindu httpwwwhinduonnetcomthehinduholnus001200405140111htm

Was Manmohan Singh swornin on the 19th or did he merely become the designate I have not seen anything saying he IS now PM  1846 May 20 2004 UTC

 How about this The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM Is it a technical point that he is PM only after hes been sworn in   Talk 

 To summarise the entire process once the election results in India are declared the President has the prerogative to invite any person by convention  the elected leader of the single largest partycoalition Note again  the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament as yet to form the government Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made Technically the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered In case of disputed numbers the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion within a stipulated period And if the leader is unelected heshe is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months

 The case of the Parliament is a little more curious The parliament is born on the day of its first session when the individual members are sworn in So technically as on date India has a government without a parliament It would continue to remain so until June 2 when the monsoon session convenes  1337 May 27 2004 UTC

 Thanks  for the clarification   Talk 

First nonHindu
The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first nonHindu to be PM I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this but I think its wrong or at least disputable in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee At any rate his father Feroze Gandhi was halfMuslim and halfParsee and if Im not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay not that anybody in the family is exactly religious  0014 20 Feb 2005 UTC
