IP block extensions 

While I completely agree that 8115185109s edits were horrid I gave a short block specifically to avoid collateral damage with someone else that may inherit the IP 48 hours is a very very long time for an editor who has shown a pattern of editing from multiple IP addresses I wont reverse it but I urge you to reconsider it   talk
