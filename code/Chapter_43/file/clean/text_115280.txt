Seems like retaliation to me The link to Greencine was not to their main page but to their Bollywood for newbies page which is helpful The filmi song plagiarism page is a major resource and MUST go back up Down Melody Lane I can relinquish but others may not agree 

 Not only the editors here but my filmi gurus on Usenet recartsmovieslocalindian recommend the song plagiarism site highly since it lets you make your own judgments about whether it is plagiarism or not
