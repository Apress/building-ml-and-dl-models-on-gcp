I have found further evidence related to this big hoax  

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article and created The Pugilist Club article you cited is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources or sources only he claims to have access to He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism Amelia Earhart the Wright Brothers and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro Chase a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly if not wholly on this individuals fantasies  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405 the item number into the ebay search When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless  When I gave the ebay item number then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints  The buyer obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article The Pugilist Club and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page left positive feedback for it  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart Wright Brothers and pugilism posters Now I find the authors wikipedia alias is TikiTwo  Well that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses 

I do not know what his motives are but it seems he perhaps in conjunction with associates are building a hoax on wikipedia possibly as members of a fraternity It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies  As a relative outsider to wikipedia I dont know what course to take and really dont have the time to find out  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation  This individual may find and delete this post but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax  

There is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either  There is no record of a Pugilist Club aka Fight Club at Purdue anywhere else online    

This wont be the only place I send the above information
