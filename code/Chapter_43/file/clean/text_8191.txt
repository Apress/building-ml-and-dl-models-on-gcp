you are correct about the авиации word but wrong about lyotchik In russia civil pilots a called пилот pilót and military pilots are called лётчик lyótchik it is a military profession not a rank same as pilot not a rank in any military Word солдат soldát means soldier and used same way as in english Word моряк moryák in russian comes from word море moryé meaning sea so in general speech it coul be translated as a seaman even some online translaters do that or as a sailor but in military ranks important is the equevalency not the translation and the equivalent to US rank of seeman would be russian rank of matros while moryak is general term which could applied to anybody who seves in navy or in a civil fleet
