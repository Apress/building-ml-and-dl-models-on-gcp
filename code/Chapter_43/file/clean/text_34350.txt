First of all I said he was acting like a fascist  Secondly you and the admins have shown zero good faith  Thirdly my edit is still correct and there will come a time when a respected editor comes around and edits this page and I will be shown to have been correct  You are wrong Jayron  And furthermore I made a few edits correcting grammar and punctuation which were ignored  I guess you like having articles with incorrect punctuation and are too busy reverting quality edits that you consider vandalism with your twinkle tools  You should get in the trenches and edit a la old school
