Fandom 

Seeing how its gotten to be Im surprised at how little its mentioned of Its even been referred to in article  Im not saying we should start posting up links to fanart or fanfics dont care for them but some things should be made mentioned of

 Shipping
 Considering its relationship with both the series and fandom definately needs made mention of Not Zomg Katara and Aang should like totally get together Kataanger 4ever Something like
One aspect of the series is the shipping which has come to be one of the franchises main foundations This is best expressed by the last Comic Con panel which included a hilarious slide segment dedicated to identifying each and every one and then some The most infamous ship is that of the Zutara ship As the portmanteau  name implies the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in The Waterbending Scroll One way or another it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show American Dragon Jake Long Regardless of it origins due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it as it has been mentioned in almost every interviewconvention Also evident is the fact that the very first commercial clip for the season two finale centered around informing viewers that the two were to be spending some unexpectesd time together

Now as a person who doesnt ship for any show as it has a knack for getting in the way of the plot and true characterizations and this shows no different Sokkas role in Lake Lagoi for example Im surprised their isnt even some little line like For one reason or another numerous fans have enjoyed pairing blank with blank ever since their interaction in the waterbending scroll in complete disregard of the natural intial unliklihood Some are thoroughly convinced that the two will end up together  somewhere in their trivia section 

 Once again fanart and all that other crap shouldnt be put here but there are some who should be made mentioned of Kimberly Miranda aka Isaia aka Aviaqs satirical take on the Avatar fandom has earned her mention in articles and recognition in the eyes of the staff she was right on the money with that one To go even further recently the deviantart user rufftoon known best for lighthearted Avatar based strips has been enducted as a storyboader for the series Seriously  

 Finally in terms of media Avatar fanvids and online episodes have come to be quite common on youtube even earning some most viewed honors but are constantly deleted because of copyright issues Though common for most youtube vids problems arose with the Google Youtube deal  and have reached a headway In that tens of thousands of vids were once again removed and due to Avatars relations to Viacom it was affected  The staff once even expressed their sympathy and support for the production of the videos

We did remove the illegal episode broadcasts but the mashups are great Everybody at Avatar loves them I have also noticed that some of them have been removed However it is not by us Most likely it is the record companies pulling the content because of the music that is used 

Google is cracking down on a lot of this now that they have bought youtube 

We still encourage mashups and videos to the fullest 

Naturally all this crap doesnt have to go on the main page could just have a link to its page like with the media information Come to think of it fits well under the franchise category Doesnt even have to all be crammed in one place like this it just calls for some mentioning here and there yaknow Heart of series More or less
