Rereading the section literally everything that Boyd deleted that includes Google Groups citations are quotes from Boyd himself  The stuff that Boyd denied for example the comment about Burton Richie claiming that Boyd had an offer to buy the software with enough money left over to pay the Pokerspot players and several hundred thousand for himself but Boyd turned it down because he didnt want to sign a standard noncompete You wont get me out of the industry this easily was removed because of the issues with Google Groups  While I disagree with the removal of that information I understand why  Theres no reason to remove quotes directly attributed to Boyd  6881192142
