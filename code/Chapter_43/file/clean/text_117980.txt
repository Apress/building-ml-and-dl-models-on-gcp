Suggestion for WikiProject United States to support WikiProject Montana
It was recently suggested that WikiProject Montana might be inactive or semiactive and it might be beneficial to include it in the list of projects supported by WikiProject United States I have started a discussion on the projects talk page soliciting the opinions of the members of the project if this project would be interested in being supported by WikiProject United States Please feel free to comment on your opinions about this suggestion
