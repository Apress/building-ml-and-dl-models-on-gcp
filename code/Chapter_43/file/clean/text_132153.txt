I didnt think you were rude at all Absolutely not I said sorry because I made that edit believing that because Menchovs second place was stripped others were elevated to 2nd and 3rd place I did not know that it was left blank therefore I said that I am sorry and you were right And thats when I decided to add the source that you gave in the edit summary for which I thank you beside it so that others dont make the same edit that I did What you wrote didnt appear rude at all
