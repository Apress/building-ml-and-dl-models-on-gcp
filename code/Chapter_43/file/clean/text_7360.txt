Okay I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasnt Jewish  Firstly Marx didnt kill anybody nor did his ideology  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people Im not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century  Beyond that Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry  His primary language was German and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works  Although he spent most of his later life in England Ive never really heard that he didnt always consider himself to be a German  Id think in fact that living in England would have accentuated that  While I do think that his Jewish background is important and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one  His own works emerged out of postHegelian debates within the German philosophical community and his greatest influence throughout his life and for several decades afterwards was in Germany where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe Britain France and Russia in particular had their own nonMarxist socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time if ever  Marx was German of Jewish descent  Being an internationalist is a statement of intentions for the future of the world not of present day identity
