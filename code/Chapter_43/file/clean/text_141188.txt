First if you think refs to Tome of horrors could save these articles from being deleted or more likely redirected in AfDs youre wrong Tome of Horrors is material officially licenced and authored by Wizards of the Coast it is thus a primary source affiliated to the subject or its creator it cannot be used to establish notability and wont be of any use in AfDs It is not your inclusion of these refs that prompted me to redirect the articles but the fact that they are nonnotable because based only on primary sources and that there is already a consensus at the DD project and at several AfDs to redirect There are hundreds of these nonnotable monster articles so yes redirects are more convenient and less timeconsuming than 400 AfDs but dont delude yourself into thinking they would survive AfDs otherwise Add refs from Tome of Horrors if you want but it wont save articles from redirection whether by bold editing or AfD If there was no ground to redirect them then you wouldnt be afraid to draw attention on them
