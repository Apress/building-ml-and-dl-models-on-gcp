Were at the point where there is no sense in dwelling on it You have been widely accused of following me here and were sanctioned for issuing threats against me in direct relation to this article but harping on about that isnt going to improve the article Were on this talk page to improve the article so lets do it You yourself created this thread with the title this article NEEDS thematic sections Therefore we can deal with this issue by discussing it but the only problem is that Im not sure the users here alone will arrive at a consensus What is needed is concrete proposals for how to reach consensus on this issue and Ive made several such proposals In keeping with the topic of the thread that you yourself created I want to know whether you have an idea of your own better than a request for comment
