Cody Porter dies while foolishly copying Kimimaro Kaguya    
    
 Okay we need to add this SERIOUSLY I mean we added the crap about a freakin death note so I believe we definitely should add this Especially since a little ten year old baka died     
    
 News report   T  C    
    
 This has already been discussed before here Check that discussion for the news reports and why we decided not to include it Also he was imitating Gaara not Kimmimaro warranting the nickname of S Sand Hero from b Got a present for ya  Mission Log    
    

Heres where it went wrong

 No He was copying Kimimaro Dont believe every little detail from a reporter who calls it Nerutu Sand Ninjas Gaara was using armor he wasnt actually buried Sorry if I sound aggressive but I know my Naruto     
 I seriosly dont want to be rude but these parents and a whole ton of other people are clueless They all think that Naruto is some weird kids show like Doraemon or Pokémon No it was made for teenagers well in the 15 of age or older and was serialized in a teenager magazine Its stupid these companys make all of em look like Pokémon so they all think they are for little children Now look at what you got a clueless news reporter calling it Neruto Sand Ninjas and a bunch of perverted little children saying Haha Sexy Justu Haha It really gets on my nerves  Wikipedia the free encyclopedia    
 Nah it was Gaara Teh internets have decided that he was imitating Gaara dubbing him the Sand Hero and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the internets Got a present for ya  Mission Log    
    
 If he were copying Kimimaro hed be trying to remove his femur for use in a rousing game of hoop and stick Now that would be worth watching To    
    
 I dont know whether to find that hilarious or disturbing perhaps both   T  C
