First of all lets use proper English  There is Turkic as adjective and there is Turkic people as noun in modern English There is no Turkics in English as a noun  Azerbaijanis by far is the rightest terminology  If you want to emphesize the ancient periods Azerbaijani still should be fine because Azerbaijani is a new term for Turks who used to live in old days  Only Azeris have lived in or near modern Armenia  Kars Igdir which are in Armenian border of Turkey are all populated and used to be populated by ethnic Azeris and then some Kurds  There is no known fact of Anatolian Turks living in or near modern Armenia
