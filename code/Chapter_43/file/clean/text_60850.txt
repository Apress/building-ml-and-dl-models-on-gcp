The American Agenda to Homosexualize the World 

Why does this article make him sound like a bad person for condemning behaviorstraits that are obviously wrong and misplaced I was reading all his quotations and views in the article which are in line with biblical teachings and I realized that the conclusion given always made him look like a confused fellow What is WRONG is WRONG Homosexuality has been WRONG is still WRONG and will foreverly remain WRONG till the end of time and nothing can change that as long as this earth remains No matter how Americans and that Pope dude try to stylishly impose homosexuality on the world there will be few people of dignity like Bishop RL Burke who will always stand for the truth Dont tell me that Wikipedia is not the right place to discuss the morality in homosexuality because I already knew that before coming here At this point I expect the Progay activists to delete my post giving reasons like it does not contribute anything to this article
