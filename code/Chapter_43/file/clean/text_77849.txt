For the record I am fine with this decision and told Milo that I wouldnt be reverting the deletion before he make an issue of it at WPEL  I am new around here and after being kindly refered to the COI page I understand why posting a link to my own site no matter its quality or authority is unacceptable  That isnt to say that Public Parapsychology isnt an appropriate link for the articlejust that its inappropriate for me to put it there  Talk  Contribs
