Question 

Would you be happy if nobody else contributed to the Spore aticle  talkContribs 
No Other people have contributed This isnt about contribution   
I know but a lot of your posts on the talk page go something like this
Editor 1 I think the article should say this
You No
Editor 2 I think the article should say that
You NO NO NO refer to something that supports your view on what the article should say Period End of discussion
Editor 2 But
You I dont want to hear it Youre WRONG
Now granted not all of your posts are like that but there are so many that have that kind of tone that I think its likely to scare away a lot of wouldbe contributors  talkContribs

It has seemed like that for a while You disagree with a majority of people and its getting a bit disruptive in my view Dont claim ownership on the article JAF others are free to edit it Your opinion doesnt control it   
Why dont you check the other articles I created  I dont interfere that much Spore is just an article that people want to add wrong information to And it isnt my opinion Ive already backed up what Ive said with tons and tons of facts and citations Things will change when the game comes out because a lot of the article will disappear ie the phases will be clearer instead of what was just based on what was told to us

Well theres always Front Office Football but I like a graphic coat of paint sometimes Fortunately I own a 360

Series finale

I actually happen not to dislike most of the shows I removed I very much like several of them If the Fresh Prince one is indeed somehow notable the Friends one is certainly not its just the end of a popular show  as runofthemill as finales get Theres nothing very noteworthy about Xena the finales events might be large in the world of the program but theyre not in any way important in the realm of television or media Frasiers last episode was great but again why does it deserve any sort of mention These are just relatively new popular shows whore mentioned because they have a fan base their last episodes really arent very notable unlike say those of Newhart or the show where it turns out the
