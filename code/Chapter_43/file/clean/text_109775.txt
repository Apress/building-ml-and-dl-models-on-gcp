Since these wrestling article pages took their current form about 7 years ago one of the rules has always been that if a wrestler holds a championship he automatically gets included as part of the roster  PJ Black won the King of the Mountain Championship at last nights Impact Wrestling tapings thus he automatically gets included on the roster  The note at the top of the page is to let everybody know that TNA and GFW have a talent exchange agreement so they dont have to include every GFW guy that makes an appearance on Impact Wrestling  Black KOTM Champion and Jarrett general manager get special mentions due to their specific rolesPJB has a title and JJ is the authority figure  Once PJB loses his title hell be removed as will Jarrett once he loses his authority figure role  Vjmlhds
