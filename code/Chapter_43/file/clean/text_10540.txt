Omnivore

You and I are both fringing on the three revert rule so please discuss on the omnivore talk page The information you are changing is redundant of what is already in the article  that humans have the ability to digest meat We dont have to go into details especially using the teeth argument which is not strong when pitted against the arguments in favor of humans being herbivores But if its what I think you are saying its obvious that humans can use teeth to eat meat and we shouldnt have to say that we have teeth Thats really irrelevant as the info is redundant anyway Again please discuss on the talk page Thanks talk
