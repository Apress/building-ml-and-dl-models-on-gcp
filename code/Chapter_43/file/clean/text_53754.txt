Nonsense Yes of course there were constitutional amendments in July but those occurred all the time in the previous 45 years they are hardly a relevant turning point of some sort When I mentioned constitutional changes I was referring yo the new constitution which might be taken as a relevant date And no the office of prime minister was not established in the summer of 1990 it was merely renamed or I should say the government was renamed the only change instituted with the amendments was that the President of the Executive Council now became the President of the Government
That is purely your own judgement The point of the matter is that democratic amendments were instituted by the Sabor communist functionaries before Mesic came to power And that his position was not elective but appointed  by Tudjman
