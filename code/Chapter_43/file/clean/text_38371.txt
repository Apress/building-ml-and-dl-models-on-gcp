Homeless 

I think being a homeless is a very sad moment because I go to homeless shelter every monday for my school project and kids there are so nice and cute they are homeless but they dont feel bad about it and they are still happy for that because they are live together with different families and its like a big family altogether and still theri life is way different than the people outside the world
