Wondering If You Could Help 

A couple of months ago I created a page for the Original Clark Sisters an American closeharmony singing group from the 1930s and 40s that was fairly wellknown at the time  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station includng being the host of a Trad Jazz show I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music  I properly referenced the article and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages  All in all I think I did a fairly good job considering it was only my first real page construction  

So along comes this editor from the UK Seddon and marks the thing for speedy deletion  Before I can even find out about it the page is gone  Then when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page he totally ignores me  In the first place I cant understand how a UK editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on US music secondly if he is allowed why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page so that I dont have to go to all the trouble of recreating it at a loss of several hours of my time

Im also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to

Thanks for your time
