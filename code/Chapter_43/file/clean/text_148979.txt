Ok I will post the links later tonight  All links include original band bios or press releases for Halls Tainted Red  I am concerned because the way I structured the wiki was the only way that it made sense to structure it  If I get permission from these websites to use the material will I then be able to post the wiki page as it was  Links cannot be sent now as I am not at my home computer
