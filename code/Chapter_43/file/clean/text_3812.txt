Deletion of investing strategy  

Back in June 17 2007 you deleted a page I created called Investing Strategy  You called it copywrited  I cannot figure out how to see that page now so I cannot review it  I presume you know how

Can you please say what exactly was copywrited  Since it was mostly wordforword what I have posted on my website I do not want to be in infringment there either

But really I do not believe anything was infringed  In fact the whole point of my website is to post the truths that are not available ANYWHERE  else on the web  Certainly if you thought the Wiki page was the same as my webpage that is no problem  I certainly do not copywrite it  I encourage its dissemination
