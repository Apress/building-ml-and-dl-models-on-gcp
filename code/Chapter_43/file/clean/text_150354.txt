 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of supercategories Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football soccer in NSW and Australian football soccer teams is a supercat of ALeague teams  Its a minor point but are the supercats necessary if youve already identified more specific cats   
Ah yes you raise a very good point I must say categories have never been my strong point the best example was WikipediaFeatured list candidatesFIFA World Cup hattricks when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them I forgot about their existance totally I have modified the article as from my limited category knowledge you are quite correct Cheers and thanks so much for this note all your other suggestions and your minor fixes
