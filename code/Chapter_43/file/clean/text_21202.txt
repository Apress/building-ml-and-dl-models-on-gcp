I can understand the argument for merging with amyloidosis but my gut feeling is that it should stay put Its pathophysiology section alone is enough for AP to warrant its own page And if there is more to add in the form of risk factors complications treatments etc then I think it should certainly have its own page If you dont mind lets keep it where it is for now and Ill see if I cant dig up a bit more to add Give me a week or two Im currently studying for the boards so I may not be as responsive as usual
