Well as I said earlier I deleted data from Shkelzen Doli article because it was simply not accurate It was two sentences and not a thorough written article Now I entered a concise and correct data I apologize I did not explain at the bottom but it was not intentional

I could not add to it as it was two sentences badly written

I edited saved but the article still does not show what now
