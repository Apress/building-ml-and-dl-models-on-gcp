I agree with the criticisms above Why is 100 million better than 104 million 4 million is quite a sizeable amount and more records than other artists even hope to achieve I believe that it has sufficiently been rounded already and it is simply inconsistent to have one figure on the Thriller page and another here I suggest we keep 104 million
