Poem
When the Nazis came for the communists
I remained silent
I was not a communist

When they locked up the social democrats
I remained silent
I was not a social democrat

When they came for the trade unionists
I did not speak out
I was not a trade unionist

When they came for me
there was no one left to speak out
First_they_cameMartin Niem√∂ller

Just a classical poem for meditation of all
