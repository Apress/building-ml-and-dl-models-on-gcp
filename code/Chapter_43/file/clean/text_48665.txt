Jc3s5h I have undone your edit because it presents the information falsely  The previous definition was too brief in my opinion but at least it wasnt inaccurate The zodiac is an eclipticbased frame of astronomical refrence that is used to define celestial latitude and longitude  What you have written above shows misunderstanding and lack of knowledge so  if you want to propose an amendment based on sources it would be a good idea to discuss here first with details of the sources for verification  Please present a page number and not just a book so we can see why you are making the assumptions you are making  It is my intention to correct the information on the zodiac page BTW before worrying too much about what this page says but what is presented here should not be deliberately false or misleading Î” talk
