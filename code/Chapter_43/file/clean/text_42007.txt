The following words were uttered by DBachmann The fact of the matter is that Paganism is the sixth largest nonChristian religion in the US after Judaism Islam Hinduism Buddhism and Unitarian Universalism To beat even Hinduism there would need to be more than a million Pagans in the US  WOW  What next  I think that human beings are lesser in number than males in the US I also think that aircraft in the US are lesser in number than commercial airlines and helicopters

Seriously Paganism is a CLASS of religions and not one particular religion  The Dharmic faiths are technically Pagan in nature And for gods sake there are no more religions that can be invented out of thin air Those are called cults So Pastafarians and the Flying Spaghetti Monster are CULT groups just like Osho and ISKCON
