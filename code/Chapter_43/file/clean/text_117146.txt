You only want it to say x claims that it is part of the uncodified constitution because you disagree with the claim and want to lessen its authority Have you actually found a source yet which would say its not part of the uncodified constitution I would have thought that almost everyone who accepts the existence of an uncodified constitution would accept Magna Carta is part of it I therefore dont see the need to attribute it to one source only especially as I dont think its particularly controversial to say that Magna Carta is part of the uncodified constitution
