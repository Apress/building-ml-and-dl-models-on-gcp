Macedonian Greeks 

Hello I am disputing whether the Preface portion should be included in Macedonians Greeks I am not disputing ancient times it is well known the ancient historians distinguished between Macedonians and Greeks and that Macedonians were Hellenized much like the rest of the ethnicities of the Balkans during that time 

I am disputing if Macedonians Greeks are descendants of the ancient Macedonians and would like you to prove the Greeks of Macedonia identified as Macedonian during the Greek revolutionGreek battle for Macedonianationalism during Ottoman Empire
