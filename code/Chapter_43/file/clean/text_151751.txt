Dan56 bullying 

Dan56 seems to bully people into his POV  he tends to prefer oldschool artists but also Kanye  He hates Nicki Minaj  He reverts and fixes anything that he doesnt agree with personally then rallies around a few cronies to agree with him on talk pages  Ive checked he reaches out and tells them basically what to say  On Nicki Minajs page he wanted to make her negative so used Metacritic to say her reviews were just mixed  On Aaliyahs page becuse he likes her he said metacritic is  not theendall  Frankly the guys full of shit and must have all day to just bully goodfaith editors around
