Please be careful to use the appropriate templates when tagging articles for speedy deletion Pyshcological Diplomacy was not patent nonsense gibberish letters keyboardmashing etc since its grammar was comprehensible A better deletion rationale may have been dbspam as it was made just to direct traffic to an external site or dbnocontext For a good explanation of when the  tag should be used you can check out UserBalloonmanCSD G1 survey
