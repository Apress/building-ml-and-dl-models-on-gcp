Roddenberrys sentiments on religion

Reference is made to Roddenberry religion views in the section Personal Life which is probably appropriate However the he said  she said statements regarding religious references in the Star Trek universe are probably inappropriate here in Roddenberrys biography Is not such discussion better placed in entries regarding Star Trek  

I guess from that time it was clear to me that religion was largely nonsense was largely magical superstitious things In my own teen life I just couldnt see any point in adopting something based on magic which was obviously phony and superstitious I stopped going to church as soon as it became possible to do things on my own as a teenager I made up my mind that church and probably largely the Bible was not for me I did not go back to even thinking much about it If people need to do that ignore them and maybe they will ignore you and you can go on with your own life Alexander  Star Trek Creator p 37

My second wife Majel Lee Hudec and I were both raised Protestant but well before ever meeting had both left the Protestant Church in favor of nonsectarian beliefs which included respect for all other religions but emphasizing the concept of God as too great and too encompassing to be explained and appreciated by any single system of belief Some aspects of Buddhism express some of our beliefs but also do some aspects of the New and Old Testaments as well as other books and philosophies Alexander Star Trek Creator p 422

It seems to me more and more with each passing year and each new massacre as many perpetrated by Christians as anyone else that the real villain is religion  at least religion as generally practiced by people who somehow become sure that they and only they know the real answer How few humans there are that seem to realize that killing much less hating their fellow humans in the name of their god is the ultimate kind of perversion

At any rate Ive elected to believe in a God which is so far beyond our conception and real understanding that it would be nonsense to do anything in its name other than perhaps to revere all life as being part of that unfathomable greatness Alexander Star Trek Creator p 480

There seems to be a feud going on between 68313697 and others over the inclusion of the paragraph about Roddenberrys work ethics   0428 7 Jun 2003 UTC

I think haigographic is a typo so I corrected it   August 2 2006

Trekker1 here I worked on the show and with Gene Roddenberry  He did not leave the show in the third season  He worked right up until his death  And why post meanspirited things about arguements with the studio  Is this really what should be in a biography  Im not sure how to get into this chat room  hope this is the way  I will continue to monitor his bio for accuracy and appropriate commentary

Wikipedia is not meant to be mean We try to collect facts on a neutrale point of view There are a lot of sources that say that Gene was quite controversial eg httpwwwtalkingpixcoukBooks_Gene20Roddenberryhtml or just read the autobiographies of Kirk Spock Uhura Wikipedia makes exactly the difference to the rest of the internetbooksvoices that it shows positive and negative things of everything You can not be neutral if you dont state the negative sides of a person Please help us to make this article true by not only deleting but also contributing Thanks  0612 1 Jul 2003 UTC
