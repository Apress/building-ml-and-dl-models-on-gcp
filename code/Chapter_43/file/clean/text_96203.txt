As I mentioned your spurious warnings were worthless and I erased them on sight  Like this block they were an attempt to intimidate me so that I wouldnt keep correcting the gross distortions on the circumcision articles that you Snippies think you own  In short you are incapable of legitimately warning me and unqualified to block me  This is because as I have pointed out and will gladly repeat you act in bad faith  Remember when you reverted that edit about coagulation for no other reason than to help your Snippy budies win an edit war  Remember how you were unable to come up with a justification for this even after the fact Since that day I have known that you are not to be trusted Your bias is a simple matter of fact  If stating facts is in violation of WPCIVIL and WPNPA then its time for that RfC to ban me for good because Im not ever going to stop until you make me
