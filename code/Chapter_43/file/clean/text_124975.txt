Merging the article War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II with the article Occupation of Poland 193945 is meaningless and would lead to a lot of confusion in the future Why Mostly because as we speak of Poland occupied by German Nazis we think about the territory and its history while war crimes in occupied Poland could be a way to omit some historical facts when focusing only on Nazi crimes without mentioning the whole the history of German occupation of Poland Facts shall not be omitted My opinion is NOT the articles should not be merged Regards
