Memo to Paul Cyr quit your bumbling ramblings the references you cite as examples are in no way personal and exemplify my dealing with the real issues so I suggest you try and analyse situations a little more efficiently rather than engaging in a witchhunt of the innocent Do your job and go after the real personally offensive vandals with no interest in rational debate and who only serve to disrupt not those interested in rational debate like myself Hurry along now
