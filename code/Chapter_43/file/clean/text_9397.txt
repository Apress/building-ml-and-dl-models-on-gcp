Copyright 

Hello again Coin945  I left you a message last week regarding copyright on Smiling Irish Eyes and others I am concerned about some of the articles you have created by copying text from IMDB All Movie Guide and other sites which are explicitly marked with a copyright Wikipedia cannot accept material like this unless it is released under a free license which this material does not appear to be As I said previously I posted a query at Copyright problems in order to try to resolve this but unfortunately that page does not seem too busy at the moment For these reasons I am reposting to the Administrators Incidents noticeboard where you are welcome to comment  talk
