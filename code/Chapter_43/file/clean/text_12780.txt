IPAsh 

Hi 

I havent yet linked all the articles with SC transcriptions to this template but once I do in a couple days maybe you could review them A lot have simple stress marks and some dont mark accent at all Though I dont know how much youd be able to do with personal names Also Ive been going through them pretty quickly and may not have always made the best choice for the name of the language
