Fruitella Edit  Not By me 

Dear GofW I just saw that I was supposed to have made some changes to the entry for Fruitella Nope One reason why I didnt is because I have no idea what that is and another is that I am currently banned from editing until sometime in the future If you look at what is supposed to be my userpage I say supposed because I have a Blackberry which seems to share an IP with probably 28 million other people you will see a whole catalogue of entries I am supposed to have edited in a negative fashion to the extent that I was banned from making further edits The problem is that I only edited 2 entries  for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits  both organisations are openly antiIsraeli and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such I merely pointed this out The problem with Wiki is that people who really know nothing of such entities are charged with protecting them so the result is detrimental Often in a language which they dont speak very well  Discuss Tony Riley
