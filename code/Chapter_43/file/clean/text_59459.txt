disputed Judea and Samaria and other such nonsense 

This revert violates multiple policies and guidelines To begin with there are an abundance of sources that clearly say that the West Bank including East Jerusalem the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights were occupied in 1967 and remain occupied to this day The usage of disputed territory is POV it reflects the extreme minority view that these territories are not occupied and disregards the overwhelming majority of sources that say that it is This is the chosen language of the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum and it is not in compliance with NPOV to use it in the encyclopedias narrative voice Additionally the repeated usage of the terms Judea and Samaria when referring to a territory violates WPWESTBANK This edit should be reverted nableezy
