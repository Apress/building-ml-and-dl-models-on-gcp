polytheism 
unless you can make a citation for polytheism i will remove it in the next week it is very misleading and infact the cited sky god and the monotheistic zoroastrian and vedas and general monotheistic spirituality of the PIEs does not support this polytheism
infact polytheism is a bad word as godthe oneness that which can be no greater is completely different from gods and thus you can have deities or gods yet still be monotheistic only really the abrahamic religions ban this deity and call it paganism
anyway please remove polytheism or cite it
