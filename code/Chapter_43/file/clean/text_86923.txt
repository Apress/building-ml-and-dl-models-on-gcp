Hello Summer song I have reverted eschatology back to the main page Eschatology has nothing whatsoever to do with opposition to Jehovahs Witnesses Eschatology is about signs predictions and biblical text about the keen interest Christians have about the coming of Christs Kingdom It is about the history of those looking towards that Kingdom and signs that it may be imminent It has nothing at all to do with opposition so I really dont know why you put it in that separate page that you created about opposition Kind regards  3rd of August 2005
