Re the surname Rossi Lemeni 

         I could cite many hyphen less articles covers  posters etc for Rossi Lemeni   La Scala certainly set off hyphen less  as here for example  La Scala Milan Verdi Messa da Requiem conducted 
         by Victor de Sabata 27 Gennaio 1951   Record sleeves Grandi Voci alla  Scala    Il Barbiere di Siviglia  La Scala Milan IDIS 647980   Anna Bolena  La Scala Milan MYTO historical live
         and the published poetry  AMICO etc is without the hyphen so your argument whilst obviously with foundation is not nearly as overwhelming as you make out 

         However as you are clearly totally opposed to this alteration would you accept at very least for the sake of clarification and information for your readers mention of the unhyphenated name
         in the body of the text perhaps worded as  legal name Nicola Rossi Lemeni Makedon and stage name Nicola Rossi Lemeni  to which record companies and publicists have sometimes added a hyphen 

           or would you delete that contribution

         Also I said that I made mistakes and apologise for that I regret I have entirely incorrectly used a Red link   I mistakenly thought all names mentioned had to have   round them
         Thank you both for at least trying to explain your reasoningCharlotteinweimar
