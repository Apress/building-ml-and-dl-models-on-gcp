The images have been missing for a while as Wikipedia was down for about 6 hours I just hit rollback which among other things restored the Patrick Stewart which I then removed but didnt see you had made other valid edits I also linked Harold Wilson from Prime Minister to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The deletion was done at 1536 GMT by which time the servers were up You should register then you could bypass these invalid messages Cheers  Talk
