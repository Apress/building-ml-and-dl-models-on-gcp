Ive significantly expanded and reworked the article with the sources Can you give any suggestions how to meld things better The only thing Id ask is before removing a reference please ask why I added it Ive spent over eight hours trying to be comprehensive and juggling and such so would really not want to have to redo that or spurn your work tr I think theres still a long way to go but I need another pair of eyes The Rough Boundaries of the District Run from B street at the Union Depot and runs to 1st street The union distric6t is described as a economic center for Pueblo The reason the Obama visit is included because not only does it and other visits to that paticular area help denote its notability but it is a major political area too In 1995 we approved a bond of some million dollars to recover from a recession I need to be descriptive but I dont want it to be a Circle jerk either basically a counterwait to my own small Conflict of Interest since I live here Maybe not a major reformat since I can easily afdd a lot of more sources Just a few pointers to look at I hope the lack of sleep made this understandable and if not I hope you get my drift Im going to bed Ill have to continue tomorrow
