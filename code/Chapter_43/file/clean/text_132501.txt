Welcome to Wikipedia

A lot of people on Wikipedia are against Irish Republicanism which can be frustrating  I am something of a partisan of the idea of having an Irish Republican wiki controlled by Irish Republicans and then coming in to Wikipedia as well  At least that way you spend time constructively instead of wasting all of it with Orangemen Paisleyites and Fine Gaelers here

Anyhow good luck  You may feel youre being ganged up on and youd be right  But some people here are on your side like me  And this isnt the only web site in the world
