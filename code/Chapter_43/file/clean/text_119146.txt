Pseudoscience Category 

I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category as it does fulfill any of WIkipedias requirements of pseudoscience Wikipedia states

Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia

Alternative theoretical formulations Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter are not pseudoscience but part of the scientific process Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality but should they succeed in doing so will usually be rapidly accepted For instance the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move and thus such evidence was dismissed When such a mechanism was discovered it became mainstream as plate tectonics

To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation consider this Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science or deal with strong puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away in an effort to create a model that better explains reality Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection though it may have a few papers with positive results for example parapsychology and homeopathy

AIDS denialists are not proposing a new form of science based on nonscientific methods they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science In fact AIDS denialists claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly In fact all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but cant verify
