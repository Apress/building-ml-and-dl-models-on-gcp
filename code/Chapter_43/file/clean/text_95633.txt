Ok in summary Mark Twain is not a WPRS because there are accurate estimates of concomitant population which is contradictory to your earlier statement that There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time  This reference and others like it breech WPRS by not conforming to the subsection Beware false authority

Authority of authors   
Prefer authors with an established reputation in the field where Wikipedia uses them for reference 

Mark Twain is a satirist and a writer of fiction not a respected demographer

These references are also in breech of 

Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence

Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them 

There is no conspiracy to silence these claims  This account is problematic because Twains work seems to indicate that the 350000 people do not exist in Twains time or that there are much less people than 350000 living in Palestine  Verified and peerreviewed sources indicate that there were 350000 people in the area concomitant to Twains visit  Thats what needs to be said in a section on demographics not the musings of a satirist and fiction author

Selfpublished sources

Main article WikipediaVerifiabilityA selfpublished source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent factchecking or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication It includes personal websites and books published by vanity presses Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published and then claim to be an expert in a certain field For that reason selfpublished books personal websites and blogs are largely not acceptable as sourcesExceptions to this may be when a wellknown professional researcher writing within their field of expertise Twains work is also in breech of this portion of WPRS as well  His accounts cannot be considered verified or subject to any form of independent factchecking  He is also not a wellknown professional researcher writing within their field of expertise

If we were doing original research or if we did not have good population estimates then this information would be valuable Since There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time is clearly wrong and we do have accurate estimates of population at the time it is clear that we need to use these and expunge the article of all nonscholarly sources including the Herbert Samuel link I contributed earler
