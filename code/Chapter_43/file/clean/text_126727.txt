The assertion that Holodomor is a term used exclusively by extremists is just absurd given the academic use of the term in the world The arguments presented on this discussion page about it only coming to use in 1988 are just as weak considering the word Holocaust wasnt used in Russia until the 1990s  would someone make the claim that the ru wiki not have a Holocaust page Terms become more popular its a given its the evolution of language and the globalization and linguistic transcendence of terminology TFD in my opinion is just trying to ruffle feathers and vex users here there is no way his claims can be taken seriously he has no once backed up his ridiculous claims of extremism and that it is a fringe word in academics You see Ukrainian historians and academics in the diaspora use it more than others not due to the fact Ukrainian historians do most of the research in this field just as Jewish historians have dominated Holocaust historiography Americans American historiography etc To write off respected historical literature as nationalism or even worse extremism serves as nothing more than provocation not legitimate deliberation
