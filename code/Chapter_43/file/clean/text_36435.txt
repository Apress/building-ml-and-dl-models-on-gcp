swiss cross fractal 

Im a little puzzled both by the inclusion of this shape and its linked picture The limit of the fractal described is just a square It seems a little strange to consider this a fractal I know some fractal curves cover the unit square in the limit but these have other interesting properties in general continuity parametrization of the square Im not sure the greek cross fractal needs to be mentioned so much given that it doesnt seem to be a particularly interesting shape in any obvious way Furthermore the picture of the 2d greek cross fractal shows an early stage approximation to it As mentioned the limit would just be a square Obviously its not possible to represent the limit strictly but I find the picture is a little misleading given the above points A mathematically unsophisticated reader might think the fractal has some fine structure not present in the square Ill review the page on this fractal and consider changing or removing it from here
