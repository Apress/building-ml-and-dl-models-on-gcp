Yes I read it and I understand it now  Thats why I ddnt repeat the word up there  It would not bother me if someone did that to me I believe in sticks and stones will break my bones but words can never hurt me  But now I know the rules and will not call people names even when it is true  But I still believe that having him glote over getting me blocked IS childish and I meant what I said  But if he is an adminstrator and thinks it is ok to glote then he is probably going to always be a childdish person  He has a bigger problem than I do  Its kind of like the joke my teacher told us when the ugly guy made fun of the fat guy for being fat and the fat guy said that he could diet and change but the ugly guy will always be ugly  What Flewis did when he lied and accused me of not leaving summarys and when he left that glote and all the other things shows that he is like the ugly guy  I  feel sorry for him
