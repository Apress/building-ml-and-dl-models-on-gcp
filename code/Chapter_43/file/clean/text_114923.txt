You guys sure do assume a lot  
I am not working against you guys
Where did that theory even start in the first place
Im just annoyed that some admins are not using their powers in a reasonable way
There is a difference  

I know you guys are going to jump all over me for this but the word retarded has two very different modern meanings  Unlike fag which meaning you intend to use significantly changes the meaning of the sentence or paragraph it is used in  I almost never use that word to say somethingsomeone is disabledcrippledwhatever  Often if Im annoyed with something I will say this is retarded meaning this is stupiddumb  When I said what the admin was doing was retarded I meant it was dumb  The meaning of retarded changes significantly depending on how you use it unlike fag

As for the word jerk I hear it used almost every day on Wikipedia  never have I seen anyone blocked for it unless there is a really degrading or profane word in front of it

The first block was justified but the second just wasnt I was just explaining to Chillum my reason for the rant I posted  he assumed that I was trying to say the rant over again but not in the same words  This is what I mean by you guys assume too much he assumed I was saying it again so he blocked me  Not the case Im not going to ask to be unblocked because nobody will believe me obviously but in a perfect world that is what would happen
