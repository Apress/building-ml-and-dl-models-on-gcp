RfA commentary 

Strikerforce  This is truly bizarre I replied at Rami Rs RfA where I made the point that your challenge was simply clueless  of course supporters are entitled to challenege opposers and it was simply odd to ask why anyone would not do that Now in the above you tell me Im implying bad faith when indeed Im only saying I might be acting in bad faith  Im not implying anyone else is and a simple reading makes that very clear Its not that complex mate disapointed you cant see so Ive reread my commentary and anyone with en2  en3 would get that as you dont mention your proficency I assume youre enn so that makes it even more surreal   Â Chat
