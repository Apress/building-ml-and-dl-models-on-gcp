Mumbai

If you have noticed the economy section I think you would have noticed a HUGE discrepancy in  numbers The economy value is at 205 billion but per capita income is 2850 That would mean that there are about 80 million people in Mumbai LOL I heard that PwC stated in a report that Mumbai has a per capita income of 10800  much more in line with the figures Im trying to find it Could you help me out I know you are currently busy on the RaOne article as I am but this is too much for me Talk to meLifEnjoy
