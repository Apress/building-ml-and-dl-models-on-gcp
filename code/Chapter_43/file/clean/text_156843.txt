Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St Martins Press New York Feeling Your Pain as a source of chapterlong damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers

That St Martins Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers

By the way according to the flap copy of the bookFeeling Your Pain at least as published in hardcover by St Martins Press 2000 the writing of the author Bovard has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh the Secretary of Commerce the Secretary of Agriculture the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development the White House AIDS czar as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the Drug Enforcement Administration the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the US International Trade Commission

As is now clear Feeling Your Pain does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps except in the footnotes referring to one speech by thenPresident Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law in a chapter devoted to what was then 50000 members of AmeriCorps not the 1100 Corps Members of NCCC

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me saying I was foaming at the mouth my writing was Lunacy fluff and similar crap  At this point his editing of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps quoting NCCC as having been labeled a fraud in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC should disqualify him from being part of this group

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a fraud in an article he cites untrue saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC untrue  in a book published by St Martins Press even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC  something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment if not pleasure

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins No information is better than misleading information as Jimbo Wales liked to say LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns Dbiel wanted more notable sources I posted a number of them quickly including citations from the Baltimore Sun the NY TImes The Washington Times and an Arizona newspaper  news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view  LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations saying none were notable

I dont maintain that my copy or my view of what should be at the NCCC page is perfect or unassailable or that others work has no place I have labeled some posts suggested edits  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest or at the very least grossly misleading editing to ensure that his view prevails  My editing reflects my perspective but it  is not dishonest  I present information that is verifiable and accurate to the best of my ability  If I make a mistake and I sometimes do I try to correct it and I would welcome the correction of others  I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information  

I left LoverofArts Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time until I could verify whether or not it was accurate  That is the mark of responsible editing

Dbiel I respect your knowledge of the Wikipedia way of doing
