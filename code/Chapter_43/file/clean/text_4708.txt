First off I am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts I dont know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect As a life long resident of Miller having both parents from Miller I am well aware of the boundaries of Miller and your account is false
Also I am not talking of this ORIGINAL TOWN of Miller or is supposed boundaries but The Miller Beach Area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call Miller Beach a Neighborhood of Gary makes the very notion of Miller smaller than it really is I dont have agenda here I just dont want my home town slighted by misinformation It is the word Neighborhood that is of issue Miller Beach has several Neighborhoods It was settled almost 100 years before Gary was established It is town that has been annexed It is not a neighborhood of Gary It existed before Gary These are historical facts Is Miller under the municipal control of the City of Gary YESIs it an area within the political boundaries of Gary Yes is it part of Gary No
