The following sources are unreliable and should not be used to support statements made in the text
 is not a reliable source for the statement largest producer of beauty pageants and all statements backed up by this source should be removed 
The ethiopia media site  says lost her titles as goodwill and hiv ambassador not that she was stripped of her miss ethiopia world title This source should be removed
This tripod site doesnt seem reliable to me and should be removed from the article
The Tadias site looks fine and is reasonably reliable as support that she was stripped of her title It would be good to add a couple of other independent news sources though

The fact that she lost her title I guess it seems reasonably backed up Tadias site and can be used in the article However I dont see why it needs to be said again and again The story is straightforward and doesnt require a lot of words She was the Miss Ethiopia World for 2003 She was stripped of the title by the Ethiopian Life Foundation when she stayed back in the Philippines after participating in the Nov 2003 Miss Earth contest End of story The rest unsourced statements about Yodit Getahun future Miss Ethiopias or about contests that may be held in Ethiopia is unnecessary The entire article should be about three short paras If you have any questions about this opinion please let me know on my talk page Thanks
