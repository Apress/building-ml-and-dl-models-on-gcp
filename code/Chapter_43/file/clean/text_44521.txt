Keep in mind that WP3RR limits distruptive editing whether or not 3 reverts have been reached  I think if the edits are something which has been extensively discussed here and most people are against you would be better advised to find compelling reasons for your edit and convince other editors on this talk page before making the change  Making the same changes every day full in the knowledge it will be removed will get tiresome very quickly and may be taken as distruptive in my view at least
