Timeline 
I saw your comment at RfE about the despute today at the Robert Watson article  ArbCom has extended their deadline to introduce new evidence relating to this particular dispute  Id like to create a timeline of the incident so that ArbCom has a fair and accurate portrayal of what happened  So Ive create a user page here  Can you please review this page and offer and guidance or feedback  Feel free to edit the page too  Right now I have I hope a complete timeline of edits to the actual article  I plan expanding the evidence to include the talk page discussions the RfEs user page discussions ANI etc

BTW I notice that you help out a lot at our Help Desk  Would you happen to know how to put this evidence in a grid  I think it might be helpful to ArbCom if they could sortfilter the data on the fly  I know that this article has grid sorting but not filtering  Thanks
