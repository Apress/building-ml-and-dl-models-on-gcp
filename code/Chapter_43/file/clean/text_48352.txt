Mild humor based on facts or accepted facts being unencyclopedic and worthy of nuking 

In the intro paragraph to this article the last two sentences state the following On the DVD commentary for the film one of the commentators claims that George Lucas reassured him that the project would in twenty years be seen as a masterpiece As of the year 2012 the film was still considered one of the worst ever made

I did happen to see this movie ages ago and I remember how terrible it was and it does rank as one of the worst I personally ever saw now whether that this is widely accepted fact or opinion Im not exactly sure but if the rest of the facts check out that a DVD commentator did state that Lucas told him that the project would be considered a masterpiece in 20 years if that can be fully verified should this comment be able to withstand encyclopedic muster Or does it deserve to be nuked as a previous editor chose to do Thoughts
