Fair enough As weve all seen even experienced editors hit the electric fence when the edits are coming in rapidly my attitude has always been that a friendly reminder on this particular topic is never a bad thing especially when in some cases the alternative is to let a tendentious editor goad someone into an accidental 3RR violation and then WPGAME the system with a WPAN3 report to take out the other side Also my understanding of WP3RR is that the rule applies per page not per section of text Also please bear in mind that one persons bias is anothers NPOV  for example my addback of the Attorney General language was made in good faith and is explained at TalkSarah PalinAttorney General You may well disagree with it and I may well turn out to be wrong but as an editor with a couple thousand edits myself and as someone who participates actively and regularly in talk page discussions I would hope you would consider my edit proposals worthy of talk page discussion as opposed to a simple revert  TC
