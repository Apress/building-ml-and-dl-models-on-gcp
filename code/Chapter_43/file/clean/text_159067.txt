you mean it is funny because no reliable source can confirm it it is a lie and ironically the guy is trying to use that lie in order to justify the use of Christian theologians preists and pastors to unbiasly affirm historicity Darwin had a normal arts degree  not a degree in theology And theologians are NOT historians with few exceptions Bart Ehrman being one An example if a real HISTORIAN would be Richard Carrier who has a PhD in ancient HISTORY I Agree With The Other editors Who Question The Use Of Pastors And Priests As HISTORIANS
