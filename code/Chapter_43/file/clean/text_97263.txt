Sorry about the Moves List thing 

Someone said on the talk page of wikiproject Dragon Ball that someone changed all the attack names to the English names that were used I first checked the talk page topics on the list and didnt notice any topics about it although later I went back and found out that there WAS a topic on it but the title didnt look like it was so I assumed it was someone doing this without discussing it and reverted the article Again sorry about that
