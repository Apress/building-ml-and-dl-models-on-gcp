 I think the map is a decent enough feature  its certainly useful for anyone who doesnt want to wade through the data to see what the overall picture is However I agree with the poster above that the last poll methodology is somewhat crude  it makes the map too volatile and is open to too much interpretation if two polls come out on the same day which is the last one I think a rolling average would be too difficult to keep up to date  and too prone to errors  so what Id suggest is the following Each poll is scored as Obama Clinton or Tie if the lead is less than the margin of error Then every time a new poll is added the person adding it does a simple count of the number of wins each candidate has in the last three days polls If either candidate has a majority they are awarded the state If not its scored as a tie If there are no objections I am happy to go through and do this for the existing data   2006
