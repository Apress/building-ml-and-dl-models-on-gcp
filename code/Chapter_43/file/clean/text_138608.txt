Solved at that time Obviously not You have a long history of abusive use of obscenities on Wikipediaeven ignoring the times your pal Binksternet erased them for you in an act of collusion to hide your malfeasance and it will not be solved until you start obeying the rules When I have a problem with your behavior I will decide how to address it If you are so eager to be reported to an admin then do it yourself I will continue to post here whenever I see you using obscenities and abuse and any other time it is justified by your behavior I really dont care if you consider it a harassment that youre not given carte blanche to use obscenities and abuse on this forum There are rules here and youve obviously been here long enough to understand them Even your pal has warned you about this repeatedly so you have no excuse 
As for your threat to report it try reading the post above yours slowly and carefully If you still have trouble seeing where I saidIf you think you have the right to use abuse and obscenities against other editors and that no one has the right to point out your blatant disregard of Wikipedia rules then file a complaint about my actions in an appropriate venue Then well see who is in the right here Then Ill tell you again
