Well we should include both names I think it is quite likely that Vlachs refer to themselves as Vlachs when dealing with Serbs since this is the term that Serbs generally refer to them but that in their own communities they are români and that they do not declare Romanian on the census either because they see themselves as separate from the Romanian nationstate or because the believe that Vlach is the name of their ethnicity in Serbia  in the same way that Roma may declare themselves gypsies the first option is more likely    

I agree that we should include both names I know that some Vlachs refer to themselves as Rumani in their language but I am not sure that all of them use this name for themselves It would be the best that we know names which Vlachs use for themselves in their own languagedialect I read that Vlach language even had its own script based on the Greek script some 200300 years ago but today Vlach have no written form and Vlachs use either standard Romanian either Serbian for writing  talk 

Without a doubt in their own tongue the Vlachs say they speak Romanian rumanesce There is no such thing as vlahesce

Whether the Vlachs are Romanian is essentially a political not an ethnic question Ethnically they are Romanian 

However they have lived for two centuries under Serbian rule During this time they lost religious services and schooling in their own language which many used to have before 1830 The Serbian government and Serbian Orthodox Church have been applying a systematic and unrelenting program of assimilation
For Vlachs Romanian personal names were forbidden by the Orthodox Church and this prohibition continues to this day Last names family names were created by edict in the late 19th century throughout Serbia since they didnt exist before All last names had to take the form ending in ic usually using the fathers name as the root For most Vlachs this concealed their non Serb origin though certain glaring exceptions continue for example Floric Jepurovic Stangacilovic etc

The majority of Vlachs some 300000 do not consider themselves Romanian but Serbian To a large extent this is because they do not wish to be seen as unpatriotic or disloyal In addition since they have no education in their own tongue many believe that modern culture cannot be expressed in their native tongue

It is meaningless to point to official Serbian statistics about the Vlach tongue or the number of Vlach speakers Too many Vlachs suffer from the Stockholm Syndrome

Code

Why is ISO codenone ISO 639 code none Ethnologue code none constantly deleted I see no objection in having this text as above  

Because if there isnt any ISO ISO 639 and Ethnologue code whats the point of mentioning it  

 Chinese term 

Nihao The Chinese word luómǎníyàyǔ means Romanian not Vlach and I dont see what the point of linking it here is Vlachs are not a recognised ethnic group in China and the Vlach language of Serbia is not spoken there significantly if at all Thanks    

The chinese word was added as part of a revertedit war as u can see in the history of the article seems ridiculous to be there but before removing it consider which name u will write first the uncited alleged name they are said to use or the official name the serbian state uses  

Its about as ridiculous as the RumânesceRumâneşte in their own designation We dont know thats their own designation We could have the designations by which the Romanians call them they certainly are relevant but we dont know what they call themselves Greiers POV pushing has no place here
