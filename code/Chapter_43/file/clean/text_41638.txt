Response to LGagnon Thanks for the note LGagnon Timothy McVeigh cited Libertarian Randianism as an influence and there are certainly bits and pieces as you put it of a uniquely Randian opposition to nonlimited government in interview materials involving him Why is he not in the influenced box in the Ayn Rand article Why was he left outnot includeddeliberately kept out There is perhaps not room for everyone so why is it important toinclude LaVey but notinstead of McVeigh Why does LaVey but not McVeigh belong Thus I am again editing LaVey out Thankyou This matter does need to go to editing mediationarbitration AOluwatoyin
