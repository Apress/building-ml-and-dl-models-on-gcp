1Ive read a lot of wikipedia stuff such as various guidelines 2 No Rob has no such obligation to provide an email address I never implied he has such an obligation 3 And he may well be within the guidelines who is to judge  Anyway I didnt start that discussion and have felt from the start on safer ground by taking the discussion up from the viewpoint of the integrity of science as I explained If the voting system page is ONLY based upon notability and doesnt accept reasoned argumentation as Rspeer holds then a scientist would want to see it deleted since it misinforms the general public about the conditions for democracy
