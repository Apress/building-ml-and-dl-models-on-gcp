Dennis Stamp Article
I see that you deleted this article back in September  How do I go about bringing it back to life  Dennis was actually a fairly notable wrestler in Texas and Florida in the 70s  He held numerous 10 NWA championships and was even featured in Sylvester Stallones movie Paradise Alley in 1978  Because of his somewhat dubious appearance in Beyond the Mat in the late 90s he has gained a bad rap as fancruft but I think he is really a valid notable part of wrestling history from the 70s in the South  Please advise  Thanks
