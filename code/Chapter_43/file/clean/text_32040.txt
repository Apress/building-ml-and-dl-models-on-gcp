Hi I sent you a rather gentle warning on the matter You removed a link to an article from a highly known and reputable magazine and replaced it with a link to a video page What would have been more appropriate is to add that link in the external links category and NOT remove a valid citation Hope that explains the rational and how you can resolve the issue in a way more suited to not undoing someone elses work in favor of your own while still including your own input into the article
