HighKing 
Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best abusive at worst Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided maybe not with respect to the BI sanction but even that is not clear cut given it is meant to be broadly construed but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction but on a slightly different BI related term Action is clearly warranted Archived or not as I said I am not going to let this lie I will be informing Cailil when he returns In addition to sanctioning Highking I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKings behaviour and what he should be avoiding Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here He even made that exact point to HighKing  while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reportsdisputes has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing and I can see why with actions like this Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect  rewarding HighKing for bad edits Its really no skin off my nose is it If I am a banned user do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account Of course not The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue Which given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKings poor behaviour stretches back to 2008 is not a good thing for Wikipedia Youre an admin Youre expected to deal with long term problems not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WPTE behaviour simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WPSOCK Of course not Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin you being the person who maintains that cycle of WPTE is not only bad for Wikipedia its a form of laxity that really isnt excused by who I may or may not be It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact meaning the archive now has errors in it which I am sure is not the intent of that facility Archive or no archive at the very least if or more likely when Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia Anyway Ive probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete so goodbye for now
