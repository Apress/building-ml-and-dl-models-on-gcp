Hi Velella
OnePure is being considered for deletion and got attached the relevant tag Article for deletiondatedpageOnePuretimestamp20131220174859year2013monthDecemberday20substedyeshelpoff yesterday with your comment Notability appears to centre on the products being Halal However all refs appear to be press releases and interviews from such press releases No refs of any substance and independence This looks like simple advertising Now that i have replaced all the references from press releases and all those references that were raising the flag of advertisement and publicity with a few solid references of third party coverage i request you to kindly go through the article again and see if it is possible for you to reconsider your decision regarding deletion
Thanks
