Rewrite 

I am about to undertake an extensive rewrite of the entire article updating and adding information to all the existing sections and deleting the section that simply lists ASL performers as many of them do not have pages of their own which implies that they do not meet notability requirements Per the comment above I will delete the reference to SignWriting as I do not believe it falls within the purview of literature not all methods of depicting language are literature and no effort has been made to comply with the request to provide a legitimate source
