Youve touched on the very essence of the problem  I am not Victor9876 just as you are not Favonian The distintion is that people act differently under a veil of anonimity which is what the monikers are for If I had known in the beginning of the WP experience that exchanges among monikers can create hostile environments I may have not used a moniker though I did try to use my real name and it was rejected Another issue is that defenses I have there are a few that I dont are so far in the past and require due diligence that Im sure no one would want to take the time to research them Also there have been many exchanges that led to responses that were being resopnded to only to have a block or ban already in place when I went to save the response The truth of the matter is that I am guilty of poor reactions in the past but my reactions had some justification to them Perhaps the one that stands out the most was when Ramiro Martinez page allowed his vanity publication to stand in the article which helps him sell books where an audio history I had of McCoy was not allowed to stand which would possibly have helped McCoy as well It was the double standard that caused the spiraling down of the conversation Again I believe the moniker scenario should go as Sanger tried to deny the moniker system before his departure It would make WP a better environment without agenda seeking socks and monikers Just my opinion and everyone else I talk to Thanks for the reply 641346107
