Further thoughts  I did a lookup for the Seinfeld show this show has one page for all episodes  You can use it for a model  If a nineyearrunning show the most talked about and watched in history can accommodate all episodes in one page then so can The Fairly OddParents  Remember this isnt a hobby site for you to collect your private thoughts and feelings on arcane matters  Some of your trivia items are really reviews of the show  This is not in keeping with Wikipedia  Any opinions about episodes should be deleted  Follow the Seinfeld model and youll do well   Good luck
