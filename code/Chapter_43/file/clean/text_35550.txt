Vanilla Ice 

Alright Im going to tone it down for this last one Im not going to bother trying to get that changed because because its obvious you arent going to change your latent racism and ubercapitalist view of music but Im just saying for the record that numerous critics and music scholars have said Vanilla Ice had a negative impact on not only HipHop but music in general I dont understand where youre coming from Ibaranoff but Vanilla Ice as an artist and claiming he added to HipHop in any way makes you look ridiculously ignorant
