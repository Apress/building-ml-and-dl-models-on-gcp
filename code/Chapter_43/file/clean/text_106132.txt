While Christophers shack was raided 

I changed the While Christophers shack was raided Wikus discovers and removes the container etc line to While raiding the shack of the alien that was helping Christopher Wikus discovers and removes the container accidentally spraying some of the liquid onto his face and his left forearm is injured by one of the aliens because Wikus did not find the container at Christophers house it was at his lab partners house Have no idea the name of his lab partner though  That paragraph needs work in general though because before that sentance it also states that Christopher resisted which he didnt he hid at the side of the building and told his lab partner to be nice but the lab partner was not and got killed
