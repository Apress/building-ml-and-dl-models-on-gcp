Im moving this article back to Nancy Cartwright actor and making Nancy Cartwright a redirect to that page  Id rather Nancy Cartwright be a disambiguation page but to minimize the possibility of further disruption and to give this discussion a more appropriate home I think thats a good compromise for now  That way no matter what happens with Nancy Cartwright we can be sure that Nancy Cartwright actor will always work correctly and the discussion can stay on TalkNancy Cartwright where it belongs  As for the value of twoarticle disambiguation pages they let the reader and editors know that there is more than one person with that name in a much more noticeable way than a hatnote  It makes it a lot easier to check that links are made to the correct article since ones to an unqualified name will show up in the various links to disambiguation pages reports
