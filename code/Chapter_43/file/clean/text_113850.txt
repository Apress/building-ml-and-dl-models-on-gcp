the count  Not sure what count you are talking about  Regardless I am disgusted that you have spent this much energy trying to censor what you dont like and almost no energy trying to improve it  Wikipedia is not about silencing what you dont like  As for the deletion request it will be handled in its own way  It is improper in the extreme to try to anticipate it by cutting links  You should wait for the deletion request and you should take seriously the views of a large number of experienced editors  And as for the rhetorical bit please leave that aside  People have lost lives on all sides of thisand everyconflict  You are demanding that we should all simply bow down and accept your view and thats just not how it works  You must workif you wish to work here at allby seeking consensus with other editors including those you disagree with including those whom you wish to blame for the martyrs in your family  If you cannot or will not do that then you should leave the editing to others  So far I do wish that you would take 10 of the time you have spend arguing deleting and fighting and spend it actually improving the image and the articles you would like to see improve  All you are doing now is being disruptive  If you cannot manage to see that everyone here is working together and nobody is out to slander or harm you you will find Wikipedia very difficult  As for your claim that there is no Orthodox representation I wonder how you know except for your entirely groundless claim that every Orthodox Christian would agree with you
