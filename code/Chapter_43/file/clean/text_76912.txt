Pramod Mahajan 
Number of times date of death is mentioned in the Pramod Mahajan Article
The article is very well written and structured Allow me to express my gratitude to you on your contribution

However I feel that in encyclopediac articles like this precise information should be given upfront The date and time of his demise is somewhere in the last part of the article leaving many readers who may just want to read the summary fumbling with their calendars I feel that that the date and time should be there at the beginning as well Timelessness 6 May 2006 UTC
