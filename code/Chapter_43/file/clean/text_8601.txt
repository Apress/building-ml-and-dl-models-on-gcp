Hello Tungilik

Unfortunately you cannot even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says original research used on Wikipedia to refer to materialsuch as facts allegations and ideasfor which no reliable published sources exist which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline

Make sure that your sources must be reliable if you want to know if a source is reliable WPSOURCE says a source material must have been published the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form Unpublished materials are not considered reliable You can use universitylevel textbooks books published by respected publishing houses magazines journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources Never use blogs as sources as WPNEWSBLOG says Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources

Wikipedia strongly prefer free files wherever possible When no free file exist it sometimes to ask a permission to use a nonfree copyrightprotected file under the fair use provision Ideally most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia 

In uploading images only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images Now you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States where the Wikipedia servers are located also if the image has not been released to your knowledge under a license and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder Next if youre finish determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file

In the procedure of uploading it You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox Use good filenames because some filenames such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras are disallowed and attempting to use them will generate an error message
