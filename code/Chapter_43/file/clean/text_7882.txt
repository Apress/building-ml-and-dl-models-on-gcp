Im not talking about belief of majority In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree Im saying I dont think we have any facts to solidly state by encyclopedia standards whether Jesus claimed to be a god or not You can object because its unclear but your statement he did not claim he was god is merely your opinion You really cant prove it Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here but I could see taking it off as disputed Although if you want to get into it in many books Ive read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either He believed that Jesus was the Son of God but not God He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as Son of God Although I added her it sounds possible that this MITA woman only believed she contained the Holy Spirit rather then was the Holy Spirit Yet you dont object on those or ones that may even be more debatable In least in the case of Jesus the idea he claimed to be God is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him
