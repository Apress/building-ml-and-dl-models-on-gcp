Viking Moses 

Living a nomadic life for nearly a decade now Brendon Massei born in Midland Michigan to truck drivers has released music albums under several names Spork Supperbell Roundup Viking Moses

Perpetually on tour since 1996 he has played with Will Oldham Cat Power Songs Ohia and Devendra Banhart to name a few yet Masseis body of work has received little commercial or critical attention

His newest fulllength under the Viking Moses moniker the storysong cycle Crosses is by far his most accomplished work and ranks among the best of the newest crop of American folk recordings

A Viking Moses show often finds Massei on his knees wailing like a man possessed
