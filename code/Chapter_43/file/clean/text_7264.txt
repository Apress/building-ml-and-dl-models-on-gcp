I am not Glitch Turner but as everyone seems to be usig this page to talk toabout me I shall use it too I repeat my earlier statementwith some errors corrected
I am prepared to be perfectly reasonable if other editors will stop hounding me and trying to out me when I do assume a new persona as I have tried to do several times with UserSlippery Hippo UserTreesmiler etc There are some editors who like nothing better than to hunt so called trolls I assume it makes them feel as is they are doing something for the pedia As it happens it does nothing What they should do is edit the actual fuckin pedia and not hound poor editors like me I have been editing for many years and shall continue editing unser psuesdonyms as long as I please The fewer attacks i get the more reasonable i shall become I may even find time to edit the pedia proper as I used to
If you dont like my offer you can shove it up the gas giant I can still edit here when I want to This is far prefereable to being on a leash I will see you all out as I have with TWAT Friday any many others too numerous to mention Im here for the long haul Get used to it 8
The inimitible Lc note lower case c please
