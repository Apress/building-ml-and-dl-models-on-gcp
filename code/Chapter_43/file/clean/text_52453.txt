Edit Count

I want to bring up the issue of edit counts to a forum where many people will see it It has been recently prompted by a means of defense I have witnessed repeatedly on Wikipedia to win arguments Basically stating a persons edit count in relation to a policy they are accused of breaking or by comparing two editors via their edit counts I want to ask why this argument is made if its preferred that someone like myself who writes an article in one shot instead writes it in multiple edits etc I am just not sure where to bring it up Village Pump did not seem appropriate It is kind of general discussion relating to something I have noticed repeatedly on Wikipedia
