Dates 

James could I ask you please not to threaten to block people involved in the date delinking content dispute If anyone is being truly disruptive an involved admin can adminster blocks as appropriate but so far it seems to me that Quadell was acting in good faith when he edited in accordance with the MoS Ambi was acting in good faith when she reverted his edits because the MoS is not policy and she felt the issue hadnt been discussed enough and VSmith was acting in good faith because he feels the MoS should be adhered to Its a shame that its come to this because these are all good editors so please help us to find compromise wording for the MoS that everyone can agree to Cheers  talk
