Er a massive quota was introduced in IIT just last year Of course it is not without restrictions thank GdThe quota students who flunk the JEE can still get in but they have to take a one year prep course Nonetheless my alumnus journal says that profs have already had to lower the standards of core courses and esobso courses because quota students dont have the background or prereqs to pass the courses as they stood Its really quite tragic as it would severely compromise the quality of students coming out of the IITs
