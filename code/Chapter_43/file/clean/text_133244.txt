OK I checked PoME 8412523220 is indeed right it is the legend of the fate of Amrod Telufinwë UmbartoAmbarto who was the one burned with the ships Amras Pityafinwë Ambarussa survived and presumably still died in the Third Kinslaying Now should we follow PoME strictly and have Curufin as Fëanors fourth son and Caranthir as his fifth
