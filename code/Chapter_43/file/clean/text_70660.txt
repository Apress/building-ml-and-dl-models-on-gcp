George Im not sure who youre talking to but if its me I dont see how my comments are hurting any either  This makes at least 6 ANI threads that Mathsci has started or hijacked in efforts to get people in trouble around the RI starting with a halfassed effort to hijack a thread and get me banned  enough is enough  the poor sot needs to learn that he needs to behave like an adult  

Occam please allow me to do things the way I think is best your approach to the problem is not exactly a success story yah Im interested in ending the problem not exacerbating it Ludwigs2
