Dan that you are Jewish makes your participation in that site worse imo but naturally I dont suggest that that is your goal Wikipedia Review is small enough and the participants connected and familiar enough with each other for you to be considered to be involved in a joint enterprise though You could easily achieve the same aims at another site with a different focus But one suspects that you feel your voice would be lessened were it not attached to the notoriety of WR
Cla68 Im well aware who contributes to Wikipedia Review Im sure youre all nice to your mothers too I dont need examples of Wikipedias being improved because of WR because I dont dispute the value of a critical site
