Canvas 

whether or not a post is a canvas violation is rather controversial  i disagree with your assessment that his post was in violation of canvas and therefore that makes your action blanking  

The person involved in the RFA is also highly controversial which could easily lead to that misconception  A subjective analysis of said user shows that they should have been banned years ago for incessant povpushing but hes so good at doing it below the notice of the admins and he has an admin in his pocket that the problem article stays a problem  

the user in the RFA is one of three users that are the reason i A do trust wikipedia as far as i can throw my house B dont edit wikipedia anymore  Wikipedia is about reaching consensus consensus and turth are not always the same thing

So please  never remove content from my talk page again
