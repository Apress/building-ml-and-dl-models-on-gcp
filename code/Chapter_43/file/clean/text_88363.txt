hi L  i didnt put those last two in with the logcos stuff  it didnt come from Gilson AFAIK  youll have to check the article history the diffs to figure out who put it in  you can yank it out AFAIC and see if someone squawks or not i wont or you can track down the editor who stuck it in and ask them about it or you can yank it out and tell that editor or any other combination  BTW G is accurate to 150 ppm where that number above is 42 ppm better than G but not much better  nonetheless we know Î± to about 3 ppb and Gilsons numerology is accurate to about twice that error
