Cheers for the message  you might be the hard part but I actually enjoyed redoing some of the refs Good old books you forget how useful they are sometimes I guess Google has made me lazy Thankyou once again for your patience in going through all 120odd refs It was much much appreciated Next time I write something Im going to choose a subject with three sources reliable of course and nothing else
