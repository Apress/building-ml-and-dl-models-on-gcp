There are some sketchy things going on with this talk page All this text recommending deletion was mysteriously archived a few days after it was posted  while everything else on the talk page remained there for nine months I cut and pasted it again here last week and voila the same text recommending deletion was archived again today Hmmm Anyway these above entries are nice reports though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability The concept of notability must be established through certain types of references regardless of a persons opinion of the individual The question is whyhow does these references establish notability If hes interviewed about something that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview Rather than saying this seems to me to this or that  responses on this topic need to be this reference establishesfails to establish notability because The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close

This Raymond page is obviously someones baby and someone whos account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year That doesnt mean that Raymond shouldnt have a wikipedia page But the references here dont add up to notability as notability has been described by wikipedia
