Wow way to keep pulling StrawMen out of thin air Im not sure whether youve honestly confused me with somebody else or whether you just loosened your last little screw Anyway you dont seem to see the almost humorous irony in the fact that there is no article of its own for Saddlebacking because you are the person with a Conflict Of Interest as an actual paying member of the SaddleBackChurch who specifically editwarred in opposition to creation of that article If it werent so funny it would be sad Actually it is sad Its sad because im wasting my time arguing about things i dont even care about I dont care about cults or their rubes i dont care about marriages or traditional social conformity and i dont care about the very concepts of virginity matrimony and heterosexuality which are all wound up in the controversies which Warren chooses to exploit for the sake of his professional charlatanism So really what does it even matter im only arguing at this point because on principle i dont believe your COI should be allowed to stand in these situations where edits are reverted or obstructed I find the whole matter of staying civil to you in the face of your wellproven COI and weird strawmen from outofyournetherlymysteries to be sort of a comical challenge Its too bad you wind up wasting the time of others who could be better spending their time working on articles about something educational or fun  Talk   411
