Re SkyEarths precepts
 It is perfectly acceptable to refer to violent acts to differentiate them from nonviolent acts
 The quotation is not false but it could certainly be made more precise But why bother This isnt an article about the Arab and Muslim world its an article about Hezbollah Only Hs views and outside analysis of Hs views need to be reported
 Jihad is perfectly acceptable Hezbollah has used it to characterize its actions
 resistance is how H describes its violent actions others describe their violent actions using other terms Care should be taken to maintain the integrity of paraphrased statements
 Finish however you like
