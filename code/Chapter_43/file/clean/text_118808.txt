Comment I came here from the Wikipediathird opinion page and I have to say the article is fairly good  I think the criminal trial section should be rewritten entirely  As for the trivia section at the end  ordinarily I do not like to see trivia sections in articles but in this case it seems unobtrusive though it lacks intext citations  Other than that I think this is overall a good article
