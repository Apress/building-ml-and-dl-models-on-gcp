You do not address however the question of why when a procouncil site link is allowed an anticouncil or at least if you look at the site a proratepayers site is not allowed Demiurge has decided apparently by fiat that my link to a forum on the subject of Bangor is not allowed He has attemped to explain this as being a commercial site if it was I think it would be a damn sight better looking or a site of my personal creation This latter is not only reliant on Demiurges psychic powers to determine but is also wrong

I can see no reason to remove the link and leave the council one intact I would prefer removal of both to removal of either To leave one side of the story represented and not the other is censorship no matter what rationalisation Demiurge tries to place on it There is a great deal of unhappiness in Bangor at the moment about the councils actions and accountability It is not material which could be covered in a NPOV entry but I believe it certainly deserves a simple link to enable those people who are interested in the town to see that there is a forum for their grievances

This is all the more important since the local newpaper has been threatened with legal action by officers of the council for even printing the URL which I have linked in Thus there is a real freedom of speech issue here I have not attempted to force this view into the article part of which I wrote as well as taking and gifting one of the photographs for but instead simply placed a link in the place put aside for links to Bangorrelated sites

I require that some better defence of the removal of that link than Demiurges personal opinion be presented If it is not then I will simply keep adding it via proxies for the forseeable future
