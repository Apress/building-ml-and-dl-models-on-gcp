I added Note Anarchism is loosely similar to Socialism in that it rejects the capitalist system but has a number of stark differences with Socialist theories particularly centrally planned or State socialism as opposed to libertarian socialism Most anarchists would reject being called Socialists I think personally that its important to note this If anyone disagrees or think that Im overspecifying speak up   1813 23 Sep 2004 UTC
