This is exactly what you said in your first notice on my talk page If you think I made a mistake or if you have any questions you can leave me a message on my talk page  When I bring this up on your talk page as you said you said please take this up on the article talk page  Furthermore there are no other editors who think that should be included just that one IP that added that statement recently  Do you know anything about German history at all  Or are you just sitting there with your bot reverting 20 edits a minute without giving it any thought
