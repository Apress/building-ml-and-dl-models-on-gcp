BLP stuff
Im sorry I got annoyed with you It is a bit tiresome having to deal with some of this stuff and you probably didnt deserve the full brunt of my frustration there Still please be sensitive to this in the future I have in fact been dealing with people harassing me over this and thus when I see you complaining about it over on ANI I just see it as more of the same It isnt much fun which is why I try to do this stuff only every other day or so with any great amount of focus spending the rest of my free time writing about ponies kissing or playing video games or working on my own game or doing other stuff The only reason Im even still involved with all of this is because I have a much higher tolerance than most people for doing stupid stuff like counting sources or factchecking or whatever because I have a high tolerance for abuse because I have an enormous ego and because I feel that it is important to keep Wikipedia neutral about all things even stupid internet fights

Im sorry for missing your question over on GamerGate about my edit I noted my response to you in the ANI thing which is now closed but if youd like to discuss it further Id be happy to do so
