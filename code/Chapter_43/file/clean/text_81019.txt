Trying to prevent deletion of images 

I noticed that three images I uploaded are on your CSD list  I am truly struggling to get through the procedure of image use it seems very cumbersome to me as a relatively uninitiated user  When I try to find out what I need to do to save or justify the use of an image I seem to keep finding explanations that lead to other explanations requirements with other prerequisite requirements etc  I suspect it isnt all that hard to the expert but I am not an expert  The images in question are the three images linked from Charleston furniture warehouse fire they are   and   I have explicit permission from the owner of the photos to use them on Wikipedia only  What else can I do to prove or justify their use  Help for this nonexpert appreciated very much
