Dont get it 

planned to spend three months with the Parachute Regiment at Falklands and stayed there for 3 months before returning back to England where they parachuted into the sea to secure the beach heads whilst the British pulled out

Into which sea did he parachute

Which beach heads was he securing

From where were the British pulling out

Is this tied up with the Aden quotes Ive read They seem to have all gone At Falklands Do they mean the Falkland Islands

The passage doesnt make much sense to me
