As many illustrious folks once said An apology is the super glue of life It can repair just about anything Lynn Johnston Ad rem what I am attempting to express is that I one of the many individuals residing in this online community and battleground we call Wikipedia wish to do just that I apperceive that too much has gone wrong in my short weeks here I would like to propose that you and I both are at fault to some degree We both have broken the rules one time or another in our uncontrollable rage Ab initio my presence has never been welcomed As I have come to comprehend that more clearly I realize that we both must apologize in order for mutual respect and amendment of our differences to thrive Conclusively we both have played a part in spawning the havoc of the original incident Fair enough
Ex animo I extend my apologies for the distress anger and uneasiness Ive unkindly bestowed upon you Please understand that I did not understand the significance of my actions and I had not fathomed how I should comport myself in such a new unexplored territory Please accept my apologies and I hope that we will come to develop a good sense of camaraderie I will endeavor to start de novo and consign to oblivion any past discombobulating episodes Please inform me if I err and God be with you    
Are you proud of me I made my first edit outside of talk mainspace
