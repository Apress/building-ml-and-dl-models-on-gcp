You seemed to misunderstand why I restored the comment by Terryeo  It wasnt that I thought that Terryeos comment was particularly apt nor whether it was disruptive to the flow of ideas Simply put it is not acceptable to edit another users comments on a talk page if they are neither libelous nor obscene Ive put a note at the bottom of the talk page refering to the relevant section of the Talk page guidelines I trust that you will find this helpful
