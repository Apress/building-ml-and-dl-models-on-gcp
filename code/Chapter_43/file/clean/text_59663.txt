Also Im not concerned about a block from a technical sense because I have no shortage of dynamic IP addresses  I can simply reset my router or tether one of my phones to my laptop which has a new IP address every time I restart my phone  The issue is not that I am blocked the issue is that Wikipedia policies are such that an editor is allowed to write a page using a writing style that would make any English teacher cringe refuse any corrections to that article toss around phrases like original research and edit warring for a lone edit correcting that poor style and then harass me on my talk page and can do all that with impunity  Thank you though for your contributions but any environment where I must suffer fools who throw shots first for reasons of maintaining civility is not an environment in which I want to participate  My only remaining use of Wikipedia will be to report that page to the Baseball Project and then Ill be finished  6881192142
