Re how can we delete a page which I consider as dangerious
I thought that might be your reasoning  its always better to explain yourself It doesnt always get you your way but it can save you a lot of trouble Remember of course that Wikipedia is not censored and that as the content disclaimer states Wikipedia may contain offensive material I may personally hate Hitler but I revert vandalism and blanking of his article on sight because I feel it would be a terrible folly for the next generation to forget some of those lessons Our first duty here is to build an encyclopedia  if these are bad people then we should let the facts speak for themselves and we should have faith in our readers to reach the right conclusions I cant say that I like these people or that I cant see where youre coming from but in my eyes we shouldnt be blanking the page  they exist and if theyre notable we should have an article on them in my opinion Hope that makes sense
