Advice requested
Hi E8 I am fairly new here and would welcome some advice on an issue  I have been doing some work on supercritical fluid articles and just noticed a new Super critical carbon dioxide  There is already a Supercritical carbon dioxide and a supercritical fluid  this new addition basically takes a chunk of the Supercritical fluid article and prefaces it with CO2 in carbon capture and storage  Now whilst CCS is important this new article fragments the coverage too far IMO  I had in mind replacing the Supercritical CO2  with a redirect to supercritical fluids anyway  How do I go about raising this for attention  Thanks for any assistance you can give
