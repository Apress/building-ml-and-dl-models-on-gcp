You dont appear to have understood the ArbCom rules very well I would suggest that you reread them again because youre not out of the woods yet It takes FOUR arbitrators to deny or accept the case and if it gets four accept votes it will be accepted regardless of who or how many voted deny previous to that Granted thats unlikely now because I have seen that in most cases when the first one votes to not accept the rest generally follow suit 

Finally you need to stop archiving your talk page when there are still open issues on it Its uncivil and will reflect poorly on you if you continue to do so
