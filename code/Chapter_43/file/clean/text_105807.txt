On photographer Paul BÃ¶hm 

Hi thank you for your reply The only thing I know is of the two image files published in France in a catalogue of the exhibition of Armenian carpets You may see the files at

and in the article Armenian carpet that I work at the time

The photographs were published as post cards as the Wikipedia checker wrote I need this information to find out if the publication may violate the copyright I was sure that it might not because it was published in France and there is an online publication of the catalogue But I am afraid the checker of Wikipedia will delete the images

Thank you in advance for any assistance Best wishes
