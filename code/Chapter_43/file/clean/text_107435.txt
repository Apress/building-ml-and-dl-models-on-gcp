I find amazing one of the comments by one of the wikithugs that knowledge of Brighton is irrelevent Well you have certainly shown your lack of knowledge of Brighton

What a crock of shit Wikipedia is proving to be Garbage in garbage out

Who is placing the link is irrelevant What is relevant is the quality and accuracy of the page linked to A point the monkeys in the zoo seem to have completely overlooked

It seems to me the underlying problem is that the linked page is well written vastly superior to the Wikipedia page thus shows yet again what a crock of shit is Wikipedia

If the morons throwing their tantrums on this page are typical of Wikipedia then it would be a surprise if it was not a crock of shit

Small wonder then that Wikipedia is seen as one big joke

No doubt the children will shit their nappies and throw a few more tantrums at yet more critical comments on their pathetic antics

And yes to save asking I know Brighton

Roll on the end of school holidays
