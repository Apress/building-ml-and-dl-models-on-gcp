To answer your first question about percentage amount The third line for 19902000 3550 was turned into 4060 while the forth line for 2000present 5075 was turned into 6080 So we still have equal amounts overall 
To answer your second question We currently dont have Page 2 anymore it was created at one point but it was remerged with the original And the main reason we decided to trip the bottom 20 million is because the list had passed 350000 bytes For many months ahead we wont be modifying the length of the list And we may never will if we manage to keep the bytes around 250000
