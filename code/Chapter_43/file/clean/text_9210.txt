Well the firm had nothing to do with that  It was just routine BLP work instigated by her personally  I suppose she might be doing multiple things to improve the way she is presented online but that hardly amounts to using anyone which sounds like a fairly hostile way to describe an ordinary activity undertaken by all kinds of people all the time
In her case specifically the google results are often catastrophic with such gems as slutloadcom  You can hardly blame her if she wants to improve the situation
