No not really let me explain These countries in question were never called superpowers as the term never existed but many people call them Superpowers of their time because if the term was around in their time they would be called superpowers but they were not The term was used for the United States Soviet Union and the British Empire but some people get too carried away and apply the term to every major power before 1945 which is very confusing as are dozens of major powers that could have been called superpowers had the term existed UserDaniel Chiswick 10 May 2007
