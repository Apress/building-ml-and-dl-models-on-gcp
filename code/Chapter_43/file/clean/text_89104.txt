Well after WW2 they had already struck a deal to return Japanese colonies back to either ROChina or 
Korea with the exception of Okinawa which btw was itself influenced by different groups
Actually ethnicity and culture are not good arguments considering the 70 of Taiwanese are Hoklos and 15 Hakka both classified as a branch of Southern Han while the rest is 12 various mainlanders and 3 mixedAborigines Culturally theyre a typical East Asian nation
The reason why theyre separate is because they were founded by the refugees of the ROC making them a separate nation
