The merger of the two articles under Fergana was reasonably successful and acceptable So the Farghana article is no longer needed as an article 

Do be aware however that there is a redirect at Fargana a common spelling found on the Internet to Farghana I will change that redirect to Fergana 

But this article Farghana should also be changed to a redirect Why delete a useful cross reference for a variant spelling
