Kri dont tell a biologist he doesnt know about biology  If humans were as old as Cremo says they are then humans would have had vertebral columns before the earliest forms of segmentation arose  Humans would have had fingers before anything else had fins  Humans would have had kidneys before anything else had protonephridia  And humans would have had well developed endoskeletons before anything else had notochords  The suggestion that humans could have had derived features before those features existed in their most primitive forms is absurd

Furthermore Cremos proposal would have humans living on an earth whose atmosphere they couldnt even breathe

Also the genetic distance between humans and chimps and bonobos goes a long way towards establishing our place in the tree of life

Cremos bullshit has no place in this article  We shouldnt pretend that Cremos war on reality is anything more than creationism  7610717190
