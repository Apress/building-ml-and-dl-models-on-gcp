No This needs to be here for all the colored people for want of a better term  Im still thinking about a better term who read this article They receive the affect of the words and they need to propose the alternatives Put in simple terms that everyone can understand  males define the things that constitute masculinity and women define the things that constitute femininity Lad mags are not written by women and Elle is not written by men In other words those who are of the thing itself usually occupy the best position to discuss the thing you can replace thing with any term you want  airline pilots hockey players turnip growers bee keepers etc This is not a guideline issue  this is a universal issue that affects us all but doubly affects those described as such To remove this to a Guideline Talk Page would be counterproductive For example If the Suffragettes had not made the issue of votes for women visible to the wider public through highly visible protests including hunger strikes imprisonment direct action which included breaking laws read guidelines then ALL women would not have the vote There is no need for selfimmolation as the Tibetan monks have done to highlight their continued oppression under the Chinese authorities  we just need to set this article alight
