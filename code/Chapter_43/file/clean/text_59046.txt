There seems to be some kind of disconnect between what I actually wrote above and what you thought you read  I didnt just say or imply that Noahs Ark is indisputably real on the contrary I meant this article when I said here where the existence of the ship is more controversial  That was also my point and I think the point of the original poster since this definitely isnt indisputably real first why dont you try mythological on another ship that is indisputably real like SS Edmund Fitzgerald or the Mayflower and see how far that gets  So are we all reading this the same way yet  ውይይት
