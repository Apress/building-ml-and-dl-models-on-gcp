On reflection I think its better just to delete the Reynolds quote After all while he may think that if the allegations are true it is a minor offense obviously other people eg Ace or Patterico no doubt think it is quite damning  So I think its better to avoid the debate about how serious a matter the allegations are if true and not comment on this which probably accounts for a relatively small part of the inkpixels spilled on the story anyway  I have the sense CWC and Michael Snow that you disagree with me and you seem like quite reasonable folks  If either of you think its better to put in back in Ill respect that
