BTW thanks for your support in this discussion I finally have the CfDs added onto all of the pages and see that naming conventions across the whole class of pages are a complete wreck Im thinking phase 2 will be cleaning up any merger fallouts from this and the phase 3 will be going though a second renaming pass on some of pages for consistency such as blah blah based video game video game featuring blah blah and we havent even gotten into Project or Article page namings D Thanks again
