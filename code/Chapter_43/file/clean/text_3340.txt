Tesla was a Serb born in Croatia The article is not objective and I think objectivity is important One harmless example of that is presenting banknote of Serbia with his image and not presenting the croatian one Apparently this wiki page is edited by serbian wiki page and thats why its not objective I suggest that the page should be edited by another wiki project Thats how we will stop counting Teslas blood cells and manipulating with the history Give Tesla in the hands of neutral party Thanks
