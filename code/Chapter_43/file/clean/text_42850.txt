YES Poland and Lithuania define marriage as a union between a man and a woman in thay constitutions just as several other countries in Europe eg Spain France etc They are not mentioned here Why 
And Latvia not only define marriage as a union between a man and a woman in its civil law and constitution since 2006 but also bans same sex marriages in those acts So it is the only country in Europe to do so first to BANN same sex marriage and NOT third to define marriage
This article sugests that Poland and Lithuania do the same and this is not truth So I say about it In my opinion it should to be corrected
