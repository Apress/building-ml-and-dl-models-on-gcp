COMMERCIAL BREAK

BECK Were back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul who is joining us tonight for a full hour I want to make this very clear I believe that Ron Paul in general the group of supporters some of whom Ive met while I was on the road are amazing people Without any help from the official campaign Ron Paul supporters have coined the term The Ron Paul Revolution They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over 4 million They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign Last Sunday they held a tea party where they broke John Kerrys single day primary fundraising record by collecting another 6 million But the downside is when you have rabid supporters some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidates name And I just in the break showed Dr Paul just a clip a very small part of a five minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed Can you  would you like to address that at all sir 

So YES Newsroom hierarchies Id say that my quotes about the Revolution being violen are valid And yes You feel you can just do anything with section You want With out coming to a Consensus so STOP Untill others voice their thoughtsmps_comb MFA
