unblockI have not been had several warnings as stated by Seresin I have brought Hippo to ANI in the past regarding going to my talk page and I simply stated to another user what Hippo does and how his actions are comparable to real life stalking since now Hippo has returned to harrassing me and those that support me Yes I may have gone too far as I have been harrassed for over 8 months by Hippo43 I was vindicated at ANI by many editors and this block is insulting and unnecessary and keeping me from doing good work on many articles Hippo was allowed to insult me at ANI and insult my contributions with not even a formal warning on his talk page but I call him out for being a stalker and I get a block instead of a warning This will allow Hippo43 to continue to believe he must watch me and end up harrassing me more
