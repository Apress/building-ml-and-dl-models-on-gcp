Dear CFred this is ridiculous Im just conveying a fact and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do Im like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked and youre among the public that tells him to be quiet Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me Anything that isnt right on the point Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease At the same time as ObjectOriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it and in a multitude of other applications the inconsistent selfcontradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents for example blocking me I have supported my statements with facts and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them In this continuing blocking of me Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts Im stating ie that time is relative as being generally accepted among cladists This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative that is that relative is relative How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia Cladists dont understand that it is they that conceptualize reality but instead think they find concepts They think things have conceptual labels all around them that they are branded It is ridiculous ridiculous 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category encyclopedia since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth to the best of its ability If Wikipedia contest this argument then I demand a specification of which parts of it I however have no illusions I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth It doesnt stop me I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are In the meantime Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics evolution medicine and maybe even science itself Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form ie as described by Karl Popper and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it Just read the explanation of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean It is totally impossible to make heads and tails of If it belongs in an encyclopedia then Im Santa Cladism is not science but rather a reaction against science Consist presently at 832542053
