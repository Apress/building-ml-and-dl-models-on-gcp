Commenting on the evidence I would like to assert which were done by me and which were not I dont really know what to do or what I can do in these sort of situations so this is all I can offer right now Evidence 134 and 5 were done by me and evidence 26 and 7 were not Evidence 1 was me making an edit logged in to the page Aang as I often make small edits to pages I am familiar with Evidence 2 was not me as I do not use profanity Evidence 3 was me logged in following the guidelines given to me as I faced a block message and the aforementioned guidelines were to paste a link on my page to remove the block Now this is where I am a bit confused Evidence 4 was me NOT logged in removing the Welcome template that was on my user page but I did this a few weeks ago I believe that date listed is July 25 I removed it because I felt I no longer needed it and generally dislike it when my page is not edited by me which I assume led to Evidence 5 Evidence 5 was me logged in removing the Unblocked message from my page and although I do not know what snarky is I hope it isnt an insult I removed the template again because I generally dislike it when other people edit my page I understand that in this situation the edit to my page was to alert me of the unblock but I was assuming that message would be sent via inbox rather than a direct edit As for Evidence 6 and 7 I am not user Hermanthegerman66 and I would guess that IP 247247203 is also Hermanthegerman66 but not at the library

This is all I know to do right now hope it helps Again apologies for any inconveniences
