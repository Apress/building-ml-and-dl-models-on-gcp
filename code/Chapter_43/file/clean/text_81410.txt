unblock2reasonWhile I might have been a bit harsh on sarcasm the same tone and worse had already been committed by the person who banned me Furthermore I am not vandalizing anything I am commenting on a talk channel and no where else I have made zero changes to anything anywhere not typed by me I also dont meat the definition of a meat puppet either I am an independent person who landed on this page because Random Hacks of Kindness was listed as a blatant hoax Thats pretty bold words especially from someone who has zero evidence to back this up Wikipedia is supposed to be based on facts not the hunches and personal motives of the volunteers who help out here All one needed to do was to check the corporate website of the relevant parties in a web search and you would see your hoax claim is invalid And finally you and your friends I dont even know half the people who have came here I came here because I was doing a quick wrap up from after the event and Blatant Hoax popped up on my radar When I dug in to find out more I then see its an admin who hasnt researched anything bans the people who do offer more evidence and generally is very dismissive and takes the well I am a volunteer here I shouldnt be responsible to my own actions type stance
