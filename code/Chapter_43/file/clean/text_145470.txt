Comment  Sorry that you took offense but it wasnt a royal we its meaning was that we as Wikipedia editors or the Wikipedia community dont do it that way  Now to add being patronising to my crimes youve done an excellent job with the merge  Have you really only been on Wikipedia for a month  Dont worry about getting things wrong every so often  We and I mean we are all still learning and theres not much you can do that cant be undone if a mistake is made  Enjoy your time on here and if this article is anything to go by may you be here a long time
