Am I sure about what Being a sockpuppet By Wikipedias own definition I am not I will defer to you about Dreadstar personality however in this case he has been out of line He has been trigger happy He neither tried to understand the reason for my edits nor attempted discussion He simply immediately fired off a final warning I tried to discuss this with him on these pages and rather than join in he just blocked me And as for resetting modems well you are entitled to your opinion about what doesnt sound right but what I do not think sounds right no make that what is not right is an admin who so quickly blocks editors reverts legitimate edits and does not engage in discussion Admins should remember that Wikipedia is nothing without volunteers These people contribute their knowledge and all free of charge  if they are treated as I have recently been the result will be they will not contribute and consequently Wikipedia dies Is it any wonder that Wikipedia is held in such low regard in academic circles
