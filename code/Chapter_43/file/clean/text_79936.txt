Hi JoeD Im here about one of the AfDs you handled I think its a fairly straightforward one closed a little early easy to work out how the users points were evaluated mostly

I was thinking it may be one Id take to del reviewpossibly maybe The thing being several sources Ive found didnt come up in the AfD Those thatve come to light are established print mags generally made up of about 4 languages jp fr de zh etc Some are interviews I know how you feel about them  a few are articles with some critical analysis amongst them Theres also coverage in a book coffeetable type granted butd be a few paragraphs on the person  seems to be independentlegit at least While a couple are offline ie print therere scans and such online for the overwhelming majority Anyway naturally I wanted to bring it up with you first Thoughts Also re the debate btw would you mind describing how you weighed up Bearcats input please Thanks for reading 911251825
