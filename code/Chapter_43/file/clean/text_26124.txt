In view of what I have written above I want to report that it takes a little time not just to obtain the studies cited but to read and process what I read to determine if they fit the section At first I thought that a mention of the study belonged in the section on occupational stress because burnout played a role in the study That was a rushed judgment I changed my mind I deleted the study by Liljegren and Ekberg although it is a welldone and interesting study I deleted it because the research conducted did not directly concern occupational stress The research concerned turnover intentions turnover itself and burnout For example Liljegren and Ekberg found that burnout was correlated with turnover intentions and that people who changed their jobs lowered their scores on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Occupational stressors were not measured Clearly the study could be mentioned in the Wikipedia article on burnout
