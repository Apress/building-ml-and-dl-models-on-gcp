Definitely his views contradict the current principles of Wikipedia I dont think his intention is to comply with them If no one expresses dissatisfaction and advocates change there would be no improvement

On the other hand there are users who are abusing the system covertly like user Zoe and user Mikkalai User Zoe is using Wikipedia to torture people by artificially finding fault in peoples contributions If she is not sufering from Sadistic Personality Disorder why doesnt she make contributions herself Whats there in it for her 

User Mikkalais point of view is not neutral User Mikkalai from Belarussia an area notorious for right wing tendencies who is behind the current edition of the Intelligentsia article seems to have a political has reconstructionist zarist and nationalistic bias and his edits distort the truth through omission taking things out of context and other tools of propoganda For some reason he stops on prerevolution Russia as if there was no further developments after that Is that neutral  

The important role intelligentsia played during the Soviet epoch 70 years of history is understated if not absent from the article There is no explanation of the role Jewish intelligents played in the revolution and why many Jewish intelligents joined the revolution pogroms and cherta osedlosti is not mentioned He is quoting Lenin as calling Intelligents the shit of the nation while he does not mention that Lenin and Trotsky were intelligents themselves 

The attribute of a cosmopolitan is not mentioned either obviously because it is associated with Jews 

He listed for deletion about Abram Kamensky under the pretext of not being notable enough to be in Wikipedia Abram Kamensky was mentioned in Russian Jewish Encyclopedia which is a printed encyclopedia compiled by international experts How is it that this person is not notable enough to be mentioned in an online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone 
This person was mentioned in a Solzhenitsins novel he was a deputy minister of the ministry of national affairs one of the first people to join the bolshevik party as mentioned in the debate involved in the founding of the shortlived DonetskoKrivorogian Soviet Republic  father of a wellknown russian art critic This is enough to make him notable The reason he was demoted to a lower post was because he was briefly a member of the Trostkyst opposition which Stalin didnt forgive him for At any rate the argument that he was somewhat obscure by the time of his death does not hold water because many people who were famous died in obscurity

The point is user Mikkalai from Belorussia does not possess a thorough enough knowledge of Soviet history to make that judgement The reason he listed the article for deletion was personal and political bias 

I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was so people could add research and facts to someones startup Not to list every startup that is perhaps not well researched enough for deletion

User Mikkalai even listed Aleksander Kamensky article for deletion for reason of nonnotability  one of the most well known art crtitics in later twentieth century Russia and an internationally recognized expert on Marc Chagall whose book Marc Chagall The Russian Years was an international bestseller and was postthamously reprinted and presented at the Tretiakov gallery with Marc Chagalls granddaughters in attendance What do you think this guy knows what he is talking about

He has vandalized Aleksander Kamensky article He took out Kamenskys definition of the stern style that was one of the three quotes from one of his books translated personally by LevKamensky for the article While in the articles discussion page he requested stern style to be defined This shows that he deleted it without even reading it If that is not vandalism than what is This is a wolf in sheeps clothing I suggest reverting the article to LevKamenskys last edition and blocking it from further editing

Wikipidia articles are always on the first page when you make a search on Google or another search engine This makes Wikipidia a very influential tool in swaying public opinion Many people complain that Americans are dumb and they dont know basic facts or that they are shallow Well now with the internet they are becoming more aware but dont leave them in the hands of halfilliterate graduate students or right wing fanatics

Why was the Russian Intelligentsia category deleted that LevKamensky created that contained some three dozen brightest minds in Russian culture of the XX century Why does the Russian social groups category contain cosacs and peasants but not intellectuals We think this is more political than neutral 

So stop using Wikipedia
