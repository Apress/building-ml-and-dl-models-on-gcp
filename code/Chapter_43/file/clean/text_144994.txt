stop UNdoing im editing in good faith for this article 

seriously theres nothing sinister about my edits im just correcting the english and just mentioning who wrote what about the repaso regrettably all the references about the repaso are from peruvian sourcestherefore its imperative to point this out in order to protect the integrity of this article You labelling my edits as vandelism is very obnoxious and makes me think you just want to protect a certain point of view Since im not disputing the information or making any deletions my edits are justified if you wish to go further with this be my guest
