There is now documentation concerning Johnsons sexual orientation in a biography published by a reliable academic press  This is discussed in the article under personal life  An attempt was just made to delete this reference because if it had been true according to the deleter it would have been reported in the National Enquirer  This is absurd  Using nonexistent NE article is even less reliable than an actual NE article
