The first paragraph of the article ends with

The term racialism is sometimes favored as a less negative term by those who hold certain beliefs about race that they believe to be scientifically justified 

Two problems

The way this sentence is currently worded it assumes the validity of the concept of race when in fact that term is problematical because of the way most people interpret it 

There is no clear indication of what believers in racialism believe  other than that they believe their beliefs are scientifically justified Its also unclear whether these believers are even a reasonably coherent group or whether for some users of the terms it indicates a belief that eg people with a recent African heritage are more likely statistically to have sicklecell anemia and therefore need to be screened for that disease and for others it is just a cosmetic improvement on racism
