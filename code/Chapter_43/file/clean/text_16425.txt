Acceptance of reposted article 

I see that you accepted a draft article on Jason Binn When you did so presumably you were aware that an article by the same title had previously been deleted as a result of an AfD discussion If you werent then I suggest in future you should check for any deletion log for any article before you create it Even without any previous deletion history I would have found your acceptance of the draft open to question as it was distinctly promotional in tone and its sourcing was largely to sources which were not independent eg his own magazine a press release etc or did not give substantial coverage of him However in light of the previous AfD deletion you should have been particularly cautious about accepting the draft The editor who uses the pseudonym
