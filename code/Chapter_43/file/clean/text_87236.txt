He also exaggerates claiming that my edits are vandalizing and abusive when in fact I was only trying to improve a couple articles which he then reverted for no reason other than to prove a point disrupting wikipedia to prove a point isnt allowed on wikipedia even if it meant WORSENING the state of an article and reimplementing broken links bad disambiguations and incomplete information  Netscott has done more harm to wikipedia than good and thus for this reason if you block me and not him then you must either block both of us or block none of us
