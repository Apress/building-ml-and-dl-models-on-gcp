Thanks for making my strategy work this is a shared research PC in a documentation centre and some other muppets have been complaining about not having editing priveleges on WP when they try and change their chemical engineering articles It took longer than I thought for you guys to ban this IP you must be slipping up Thanks anyway and do make it an indefinite ban please these chem eng guys are idiots and dont deserve editing privileges on WP Cheers
