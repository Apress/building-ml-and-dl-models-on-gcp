well now that I look at the article more closely I can at least see where this movereq is coming from and its not as tendentious as I thought This article is a mess I still dont support renaming it though as the provide a worldwide view within this article is a mistake As I mentioned above there are plenty of articles that can and should provide a worldwide view of Gun control issues but the subject of this article is a US centric subject and should be refactored in order to be presented as such Rather then worrying about the name just get to work copy editing the article
You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views  Right  If so the problem still remains that the title of the global half of the split should have a global viewpoint  And the keep and portion of the article title taken from the US Bill of Rights is decidedly USA centric  Explain how keep and is global    
Or perhaps the article could take an approach as describing purely the concept of RKBA and maybe the cultures andnations where it exists and other subjects as necessary although I suspect the same debates will come up in those areas  Perhaps altering the general approach and method of the article could be an alternative to renamingmoving it  Id be willing to give it a shot if everyone else would
