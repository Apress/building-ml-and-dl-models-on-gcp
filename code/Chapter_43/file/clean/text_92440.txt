Hi 
 Re 1 and 2 I dont have access to any additional facilities  I am a runofthemill editor like you not an administrator  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do it does not require administrator privileges  The procedure for doing this is described on WPCP  It does take an administrator to delete a page however which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations  The notice is posted on the article in question and on the WPCP page nowhere else  Again I have no subscription to EB nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations
 Re 3 If you scroll down WPCP youll see it consists mainly of reports with the occasional comment many of which are not from the original poster  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window  There are many new contributors who happily copyandpaste from other websites with utter disregard of their copyright notices and our policies  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples  Most entries on the WPCP page are in dated sections under New listings but some have fallen off the top into Older than 7 days  
 Re 4 If you look at the original report on WPCPJuly 11 youll see that  listed that URL  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice  How that URL was found I have no idea but I would suspect search engines before spyware  8  Its by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure  Im prepared to accept that its within the bounds of coincidence
 Re 5 You are correct permit me to clarify  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like in Wikipedia for noncommercial purposes providing it is quoted without alteration or on condition that the source is credited in a particular way  Unfortunately none of those except perhaps the last is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above
 Re 6 New articles can be seen at SpecialNewpages  Changes to all articles can be seen at SpecialRecentchanges  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users
 I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours  In the same circumstances were I an administrator I would probably not have done this but you have to admit that you did twist each others tails quite a bit  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project  8 Note that you can still edit your user page and I think you can still send emails using the Email this user link  Ill add a note to both entries on WPCP that we are in a dialogue
 This is probably an unnecessary remark but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself  Sorry
