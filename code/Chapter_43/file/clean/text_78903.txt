Yup you figured it out theres only one person in all of the New York area who knows anything about investing and Jim Cramer  You are a moron you never seem to add anything factual to the article yourself  You might have reverted frequently but you never had any facts  Why couldnt you find an SEC document  Which authoritative source did you support  Benzinga  Myspace  You are basically one of the pathetic Wikipedia editors who believes that if simply a lot of people say something that it must be true but in the end have no clue one way or the other  People like you are dangerous because you create pseudofact by popular demand and because of your sense of pride  You drift along the beach all your life doing nothing so here you can feel important  Good job  1086202208
