You keep assuming these conclusions which are not written in my edit
Im going to make another version of my edit and if you guys keep removing it then you are in fact guilty of bias in hiding the statistics of what a kinect can or cant do
Criticism is a fine heading I will gladly rename it or move it to another section if this helps you sleep at night You are so being biased and then accusing me of it
Whatever you think is a conclusion is based entirely from your opinion I did not write those things even in the first version last week which had you guys censor me
What happened to free wikipedia Your willingness to censor information is disgusting and you guys are killing the idea of wikipedia being neutral with your bias while claiming you are neutral
