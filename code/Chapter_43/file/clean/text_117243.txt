Chris Martin 

HiI have spotted your new article on Chris Martin  I suspect you may be Chris or linked to him in some way in which case you should be aware of Wikipedias policies on Conflict of InterestI have made a few corrections to accord with Wikipedias formats  eg referring to people by their surname and have moved the article to Chris Martin rower which is how Wikipedia would index such an article  I have also added some internal links to other Wikipedia articles The external links need reformatting to explain what they are rather than just bare URLs which I will try to do tomorrow Coincidentally we met briefly in 2005 in La Gomera at the start of the race
