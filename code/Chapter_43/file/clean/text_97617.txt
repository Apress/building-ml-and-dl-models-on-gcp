The apotropaic powers of inscriptions 

Ã„potropaic means to turn away the idea was that a demon could be turned away from a house etc by displaying a holy text or at least a magical text near the door The inscription therefore had to be clearly visible  at headlevel and outside the door no point in letting your demon come inside before he could read the magic The Tel Yayit stone doesnt fulfill these criteria it was being used in an internal wall inside a dark room was about 3 feet off the ground and was very faint The archaeologists who found it missed it themselves until the last day of excavation when they just happened to see it early one morning in ideal conditions in the low raking light of the rising sun Tho the setting sun would have done just as well But the point is in a dark room 3 feet off the ground no demon is going to see it or read it and even if he were a midgetdemon hes already inside so whats the point So no apotropaic powers for this stone
