Someone above said Others might be paid by sponsors CIA GM anyone with money who sees wikipedia as just another propaganda opportunity  I have proof of this particulary people from the CIA including an administrator  Unfortunately I cannot give proof here because that would be naming names and the people involved would twist it into a personal attack  So basically Im not citing anyone Im just saying there are people including admins who are paid people from organizations  It should not be surprising either  If anyone is picky about this post for me saying who it is upon ask basically I wont name them on my talk page if asked  So Im not naming anyone  Im just saying that I know of many people who are paid to put propaganda including admins mostly I know of ones from the US Government   2234
