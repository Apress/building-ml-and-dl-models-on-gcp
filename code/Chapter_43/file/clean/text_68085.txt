OK
Since I assume you are a Swede why didnt you start off at the Swedish Wikipedia
You live and are born in Gothenburg right So your main team is Fr√∂lunda HC Mid contributions 

Heymid what happened to your intention to only discuss things and write messages that are useful It appears that since you were unblocked your contributions to actual articles havent been nearly as many as your edits in talk pages and pages in the Wikipedia namespace Do you forget your promises as soon as you are unblocked And if so why should anyone care about what you promise the next time you are trying to get unblocked
