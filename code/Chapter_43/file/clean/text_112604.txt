Removal of Speedy Deletion 

Hello  Recently i found that you removed the speedy deletion of Abi Varghese by commenting If hes been at the Cannes festival I dont think we can A7 But i would like to say that theres no reference for whether hes been at Cannes festival so i feel that theres no importance of the article Rest of the article says about looks like promotional Also his movie is not yet released so it looks like a promotional or A7 Hope youll undo the speedy deletion A7 removal Thanks
