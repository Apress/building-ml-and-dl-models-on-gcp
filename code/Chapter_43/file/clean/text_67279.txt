Deleting Max Katsarelas 

It upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for Max Katsarelas  You obviously didnt read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimers for 20 years You dont even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher  Ive said it once and Ill say it again its people like you with little to no creativity and a desk job from 95 that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet youd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980s Additionally why dont I tag your username for a copyright infringement If its true that youre a fan of The Simpsons then I may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of Homers comedic stylings

So as you probably read through this and decide youre going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write Id like to know a few things 

1 Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in If you did I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion you had diarrhea Aint it just the worse

2 Are you married or still living in your mothers basement It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mothers basement because hey most wikipedians do anyways However the point is if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man Im sure in fact 100 positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas page for deletion I think its time you get some poon You dont know what poon is  Here you go read about it

3 Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume Just curious

4 Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians 

For the record I will continue to post Max Katsarelas page up because I have kept the copy I wrote and I want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have 

Good Day
