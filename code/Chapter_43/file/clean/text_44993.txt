To NielN 

Mr N please accept my apology for my rude language bad attitude and short temper For what its worth Respect is due for your contributions to Wikipedia and your intelligence as clearly made evident by your work I do not believe there is any excuse for my rude behavior particularly on articles and their parts nor any personal references I have made towards you at all  I also understand that My personal point of view what ever it is on what ever topic should not be reflected in the article because I think so

Clearly my post that I think has started this disputeAbout evolution and big bang and imago de still fairly posted was spread to far andor not worded right I do understand it is my job to post the right questions in the right places 

You are the first editor to take any time with me I see that and I see that we do not agree on many interpretations of things I like this

Forgive my lack of experience I feel new My first editHC way back when rash and I had thought that commonly accepted applied to recent events I am learning and apologize if it has been seen as wasting your time 

I have added a few accepted edits I am particularly proud of my change to Sin the sub section header Etymology as opposed to the prier History of the word

And to Mythology I Do like this TopicI am a Christian

Happy Presidents Day
