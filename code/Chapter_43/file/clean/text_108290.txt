Very quickly for the moment given the level of kneejerk controversy that attends topics like this one it will be necessary to provide citations for the assertions that these myths are parallel  I know theyre out there  Once that is done the superfluous material can be weeded out and perhaps just perhaps one ends up with an article about parallel myths which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth son of God resurrection miraculous cures etc  Note carefully that Im not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not  But I am making an assertion that if there are asserted to be parallel myths the assertions that they are parallel or closely analogous or identical or whatever need to be cited and not just arrived at by the WP writers because it seems obvious  Believe it or not its an important WP principle  So if this material is useful and properly WPAd Im certain there is a place for it in some appropriate article on WP
