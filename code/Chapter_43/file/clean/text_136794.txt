An added remark in my article that will please Makemi a lot
To prove  that I do not have any interest in praising this new CEUS computer piano I add the following remark in my article
Bösendorfer has a reputation of excellence at piano making Moreover Germanspeaking countries such as Austria have a tradition of excellence at anything related to solving complex engineering tasks And lastly Austria is in Europe and the way products are advertised in Europe is much more honest than the way they are advertised in the USA features of products mentioned by European companies are nearly always true contrary to what happens in the USA Consequently there is no reason to doubt that the features that Bösendorfer mentions on their web site concerning this new CEUS Computer Grand Piano will prove to be true when they will be assessed by independent parties

So here is the new latest version of my article it should pleased even the worst complainers and prove that I am with no agenda at all
The New 2006 Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
During the past recent decades a reproducing piano also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano However a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it Usually it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard many digital sounds are available piano harpsichord organ strings etc It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard However the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales or 127 steps if you prefer The problem is that most of the pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers Consequently a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format In summary a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old an acoustic piano with the new a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano at the same time It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but more importantly to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time
At the beginning of 2006 Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos the CEUS Computer Grand Piano

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos including the SE 290 computer piano were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been see in particular Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computercontrolled grand pianos by Werner Goebl et al August 69 2003

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano the SE 290 computer piano Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND P
