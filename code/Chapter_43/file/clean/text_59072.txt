I do see what you are saying It would be hard to find exactly where it is as the dialogues piece is out of print and just any edition of the Protocols would not work as you said there is no definitive edition That would be like someone saying on page 10 of the Bible well which edition of the bible But since this section does clearly site page numbers it would be nice to have the edition used But i guess ytou cant have it all
