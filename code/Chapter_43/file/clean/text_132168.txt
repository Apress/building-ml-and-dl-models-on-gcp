about my last edit
I changed a passage that seemed to imply that gaarder did not really deny the allegations of antisemitism but merely blamed it on his outrage That is incorrect He has made it pretty clear even in the interview accompanying the op ed that he is not an antisemite 
People may speculate that he may be one even though he says he is not but that is anoher story
