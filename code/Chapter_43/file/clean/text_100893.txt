AIK ice hockey    I agree with Krm500 and DJSasso in the first discussion AIK IF is the abbreviation of Allmänna Idrottsklubben Ishockeyförening which is the full name of the club But Allmänna Idrottsklubben Ishockeyförening is too long for an article name so I suggest like Krm500 and DJSasso that AIK IF should be the name of this article Mid contributions
