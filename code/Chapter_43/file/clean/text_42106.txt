You can put messages at the bottom of a page either by clicking on the  tab or simply by scrolling to the bottom  Talk pages whether a Users talk page or an articles Talk page are just like articles you can just open them up and edit them anywhere
And yes its very hard to figure this place out when youre getting started so no need to apologize and feel free to keep asking questions  Good luck    Talk
