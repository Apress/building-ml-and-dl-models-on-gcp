Insurance Patents 

I added the patent refernce back  It is a good example  I agree the promotional tradename FastTrackClaim may be a little over the top  The refernce to the company that owns the patent should be acceptable as well  There are many companies named as having refernce  However to avoid controversy I removed the refence and link to Ultimate Claim Solution Inc Dale
