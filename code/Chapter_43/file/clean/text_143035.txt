Picking on opinions you do not like is obscene 

I followed the discussion The proposal to userfy all userboxes did not succeed and in the meantime there is nothing ruling out political userboxes not to speak of deleting them from the user space Singling out someone you do not agree with like NicholasTurnbull does is just obscene and as long as you do not delete all the userboxes  which I would be perfectly ok with  stop picking on mine
