10th Amendment Task Force 

Kevin
I appreciate your consideration and review of the proposed 10th Amendment Task Force Wikipedia page httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipedia_talkArticles_for_creation10th_Amendment_Task_Force  A task force or caucus within the House of representatives qualifies as an important or significant subject  You will find several others within the Wikipedia domain Many other caucuses have Wikipedia pages and I dont see how this one under qualifies when compared with the others May I ask how the 10th Amendment Task Force does not merit a Wikipedia page when people may arbitrarily create them for themselves such as this httpenwikipediaorgwikiEmily_Lawrimore  How is this any more worthy of an encyclopedic reference

There are numerous and diverse source citings that are reliable and independent throughout and it appears as though your editing is based less on the pages failure to meet your requested criteria and more on your personal disregard for the page itself  

According to independent analysis from several other Wikipedia editors the sources included meet both the reliable and independent criteria

Thank you for your time
