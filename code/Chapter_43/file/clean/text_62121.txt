banned user 

There is no way to accomodate the banned user and apparently no way to deal with anonymous users with access to endless IPs repeatedly inserting fictitious information or vandalizing pages other than undoing it  Removal of dates and sources only encourages the banned user see MONSTER release date discussion above  Stating nobody cares is apparently not true as the article is apparently in some sort of historical order with some importance attached to Monster to the detriment of all other OLCs  One I disagree with as older article versions attached no particular notability to any particular OLC
