Personally Im not as it really seems like were portraying Donohues characterizations as valid Give Donohue which essentially is the Catholic League credit as he is a seasoned pr and talk show veteran and seems to know what hot buttons to push and how However if we are going to give him a platform I would feel better if we broke down the section into the major points with balancing statements so the readers can easily see the issues dissected and addressed To me the section feels like a severalheaded beast each adding a sentence onto the next with the net result of confusion I suggest sections including one devoted to just the Leagues issues if its just them so we dont infer because the League said X then Y happened In my opinion Donohue speaks as if hes representing Catholics and is actually seen by many Catholics as an extremist Im not sure if rightwing is accurate whos actually feeding antiCatholicism by perpetuating stereotypes in pop culture arenas while ignoring concerns of mainstream Catholics I may not be wording this in the best way but I think the gist is there Benjiboi
