Hi 
Hi  Just to be clear I havent made any threat You misunderstood I told  that if he will vandalize Vaslui articles again I will report him to the admins I didnt said anything about me to block him because I dont have this kind of power Starting three or four weeks ago an anonymous user kept editing on Vaslui page false information about the team The media speculated many transfers and this user edited them all as being sure transfers This was for almost three weeks when I just couldnt keep revert his edits anymore So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page and linked every sentence because there was no reference before and I applied for semiprotection for SC Vaslui page After I got the page protected there was no longer any false information until  edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui back then he wasnt I saw his contribs and noticed that he is 13 years old and is a big SC Vaslui fan and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before I dont think thats a coincidence However I noticed he has no current activity so I think he either got my message or he was blocked by admins Either way Im more than happy Hope you see this message and reply me Thanks   2004 7 September EET
