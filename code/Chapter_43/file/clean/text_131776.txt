I made no representation mis or otherwise as to whether the article  had any awareness of subjective factors in factor demand
Jevons indeed said that his work was not an extension of classical economics it was Marshall who drew upon classical economics to explain the supply curve  Thats why I keep associating neoclassical economics with the latter rather than with the former One could labor the effect of Marshall upon Jevons but that would be beside the point here
Whatever the intentions about POV when the original version of this article was written it has got basic facts wrong  Since youve relied heavily upon secondary sources for your own knowledge one might locate any POVpushing in those sources but as I said the misrepresentations that come from within the neoclassical tradition itself are largely a matter of simply failing to understand their rivals T
