You are replacing the view of the various RSs as whether it is relevant with your POV  The way wikipedia works that is not appropriate Your view that Time is wrong to treat it as relevant for example and that the statement reported by NPR of the former mayor of his ancestral home is his POV and ridiculous and what a cousins of the subject said is untrue and dumb misses the point  It is quite fine for the people quoted to make statements that if you were correct in your assertion reflect their POV and are ridiculous and are dumb  What is not OK is for you to introduce your POV by deleting such statements from RSs  That is why quite properly the other editor termed your deletions disruptive
