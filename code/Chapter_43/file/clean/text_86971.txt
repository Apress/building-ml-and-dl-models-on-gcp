I was trying not to bog down my statement with too many terms in that the goal of my statement was that gender is not relevant in the term of pedophilia  This IP poster seems to have mistaken the term pedophilia to refer to the sex itself and I was attempting to point out that this is incorrect  I was not isolating to just sex but the full spectrum making CSA the most appropriate term Statutory rape is not a very good term to use because a it is not used very often in laws themselves but rather is a more of a pop term bit technically only refers to intercourse and cit can include sex with an mature but mentally handicapped adult
Im not ever sure why we are even responding to this IP poster  My initial impression was the post was some kind of homophobic soapboxing spouted by a bigoted individual with nothing remotely constructive to offer this article  I pondered erasing it altogether under trolling guidelines but I decided to just assume good faith in hopes of a reply  But given the lack of reply it would seem this was a driveby
