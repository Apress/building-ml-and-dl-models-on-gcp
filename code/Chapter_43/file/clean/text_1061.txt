Hey Jimbo
Your Bbb23 did not step back instead he asked a friend Admin calling him to help him with this matter against me 
You have a open door policy right and when I came nicely explaining what the problem was and that I would be very happy to end it even though I did not feel it was fair it seemed to me that you really wanted to help But I got blocked again and again for nothing Let say Im not very happy about that because its obvious to me that the bad guys are winning You know I cant be blocked for long though since Im a pretty good brain with computers thats not why Im mad Im mad because you lied to me All the people involved against me here are biaised so of cpurse unfair And I wont let it go and no matter what I will have to do I shall do it Your actions have been unfair and unwarranted And even the great Jimbo is not going to stand up for some fairness Well see then Good night 378170180
