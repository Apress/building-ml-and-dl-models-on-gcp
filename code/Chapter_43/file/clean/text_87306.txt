The test isnt name recognition its WPNotability  We do not report our own personal opinions  We dont have pages on subjects that seem important  We have articles on subjects for which there are multiple WPRELIABLE WPINDEPENDENT WPSECONDARY sources about the subject to establish not only that the subject seems notable but that others not connected to the subject have actually taken note and that theyve done it in WPRELIABLE sources with a reputation for factchecking and editorial control  If an individual is on this list it should be because theyre notable because thats the test we use and because it actually is objectively testable  The simple way to enforce this the same as with other WP lists is to insist there must be an article  Obviously the fact the article exists doesnt guarantee the subject is notable because people constantly create all kinds of spammy articles all the time but we have a separate procedure called WPArticles for deletion for deleting articles on nonnotable subjects
