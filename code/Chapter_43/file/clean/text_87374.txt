Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page

You can explain your comments all you want but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles not users Make sure you stick to that in the future Additionally adding the unsourced tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources not 0 as the tag implys

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him with the exception of to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians which as I explained later in the same section any person assuming good faith would take as an insult You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one personally pointing me out by name I never did anything comparable to this Is this in accordance with your policy of we discuss articles not users 

As for the unsourced tag its been discussed in the talk page The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page The article is on Iranian peoples so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are Such a source has yet to be provided 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group that of Iranian peoples  see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this Im not sure whats the best way to move on from here The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind but a lot of users are not being cooperative Id consider any advice or mediation Thanks Talk
