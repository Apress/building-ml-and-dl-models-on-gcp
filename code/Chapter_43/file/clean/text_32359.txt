Youll have to do it  Ziplocal is protected  I cant start an article or move anything there  I think most of the ZipLocal inc article is incorporated in the UserMisterkellasZipLocal article  The only part thats missing is the two paragraphs about how the judgement against the company played out  But that was seven years before Tamec was renamed Zip411 then bought by redCity then that company was renamed Ziplocal then that company was bought out then that company was bought out and in the meantime a completely new company renamed itself Ziplocal then traded stock in exchange for the US parts of the yellow page search information  I think the financial ramifications of the Corporate Bureaus proceedings were minor enough that trying to dump in two paragraphs about stuff that basically happened to some other company a decade ago would sort of be a major digression from the rest of the article  Thats my opinion  I have absolutely no connection to this Ziplocal company though so whatever you want to do with it  Youll have to be the one to do something though since I cant edit the article  Thanks for your time and quick response
