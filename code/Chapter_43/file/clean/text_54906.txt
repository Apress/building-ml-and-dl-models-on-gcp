Hi Kuwar

The reason I flagged it as needing additional citations for verification is that several of the major expressways listed in the article dont have any citations such as the Mumbai  Pune Expressway Greater Noida Expressway Western Freeway Mumbai KMP Expressway Natl Expressway 2 as well as most of the planned expressways What I propose is that the section be condensed so that only the major highways are dicussed in detail and have some helpful pictures while the minor highways lets say length  25km are listed on the chart but we dont go into too much detail This way we can link to all the expressways in the country but only list the important ones in the article My proposed layout for the article would look like

 Existing expressways 
Chart here  this chart would list only existing expressways in the country much like what youve added One more suggestion I would make is to have the ability to sort by length
 Major Expressways 
 MumbaiPune Expressway 
Insert details here a few pictures would be nice
 National Expressway 1 
discuss further
 Sion Panvel Expressway 
discuss another picture would be nice too
 Delhi Gurgaon Expressway 
elaborate further

 Planned Expressways 
This chart should list planned expressways as well as those under construction It should have a separate colour coded column that denotes the current staus ie proposed approved under construction etc
The section below should talk about major planned projects like the Ganga Expressway Yamuna Expressway NE2 KMP expressway etc

Let me know what you think
