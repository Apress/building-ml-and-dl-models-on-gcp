The Ummayad and The Abbassid states were the ruler during that time and Geber was an Arab figure during that time observe that we arent prejudice he was a Persian figure too but removing Ummay The state the empire the ruler from the phrase and keeping Persia who wasnt a state and had no power during that time is completely nonsense I did write only Umay but he reverted it I did write Arab Empire and again he reverted it since Geber lived during 2 dynasties 2 states I wrote both of them The Umayyad and The Abbasid States with mercifully keeping the Persia name in the phrase he was born in Iran after all
