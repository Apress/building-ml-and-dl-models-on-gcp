Wild wolf and Cuchullain

You are both wrong Wild Wolf you say Confederate Arizona was apart of Union New Mexico territory This is completely false Union New Mexico and Confederate Arizona were two seperate territories one governed by the Union the other governed by the Confederacy Union Arizona territory did not exist until 1863 the campaigns occurred in 1861 and 1862 at the time of the Mesilla and Valverde engagements happened in the region of Confederate Arizona this is fact Whoever changed it back was seriously lazy about it although I will not explain why

Cuchullain you say it should be named New Mexico Campaign because that is what most other people call it Well I am sorry If I dont think we should babdly name an article because most people are too stupid to realize the fighting occurred in Arizona Territory aswell and not just New Mexico 

As I said before I am changing this article back to East Arizona and New Mexico Campaign because this title most accurately describes the location of the offensive
