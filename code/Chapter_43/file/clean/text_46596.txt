My point is that contrary to certain media outlets using the term for commercial advantage as well as fans of RFC 1872 clinging to a fiction the Club never really died the term Old Firm can only be in existence when both Clubs the term was used to describe are also both in existence Here we even have the current THE RFC 2012 head of media communications describing how RFC 1872 did in fact die whilst making the comment No matter how Charles Green attempts to dress it up a newco equals a new club When the CVA was thrown out Rangers as we know them died 1 other media outlets describe CVA rejection meant 140 years of History formally ended 2 3 4 5 6 ttpblogschannel4comalexthomsonsviewrangersfacemassiverewritingfootballclubhistory3936 7 Now we also have the head of the Scottish Football Association giving us an insight into the consequences of there being NO RANGERS AT ALL 8 This is where the fiction was created that the Club didnt really die absurdity 

The whole point of this Old Firm page should allow for this information to be displayed because you know fine well that people outside the fanbase of RFC 1872 DO NOT RECOGNISE the term Old Firm because of the compulsory liquidation event Of course there are going to be commercially driven news organisations in particular keen to cling to the term in order to generate money however the term is no longer representative of the two Clubs it was used for to describe It is not unreasonable to suggest it should be in there to make people aware of the reality
