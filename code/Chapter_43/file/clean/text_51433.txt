Seven wonders of Canada voted table 

In regards to my continual addition of a table to the section entitled Top 7 as voted by Canada I must defend my position  Given the controversy over the judges lack of appreciation for the voters decisionchoices the voting section results should be given equal precedence on the page as many if I dare say most who have followed this contest feel these are indeed the true wonders of Canada as they were voted for by Canada as a whole the opinion of over a million voters vs the opinion of 3 judges  If you feel so inclined feel free to remove the voted wonders from the short list or and I believe this to be a superior solution add the chosen wonders back into the short list section as the shortlist should include all shortlisted wonders the chosen 7 were shortlisted as the others  I do however stand by my contribution to this page
