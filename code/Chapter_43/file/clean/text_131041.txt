I havent been around for a couple of days so I missed most of the fireworks from  and  but I find the edits to be less than satisfactory than what Phenry was working on  At least what he put together seemed to make sense  I still dont believe that Byrds KKK past can be minimized but 171s selfcentered edits dont always seem to be based upon anything other than a desire to control and dominatewhich is always annoying 0331 16 Feb 2005 UTC
