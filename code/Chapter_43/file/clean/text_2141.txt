No problem  I didnt even recognize the misspelling myself  All you have to do is copy the content youre interested in from one article and add it the correct article  Then redirect the misspelled one see WikipediaRedirect  Alternately to delete an article in which you are the sole editor add  see WikipediaSpeedy deletion to it and an administrator will delete it   Edgar181
