Look i did not said that Ahunt is a troll I said that Ahunt has spoken in that istance like that Its not the same I was called troll and my statements are called bullshit and nobody i say nobody cared about

So do you not find strange that such discussion was swiftly ended to a block You dont find strange that the next history about G91

1 i am blocked to edit in this page All i write is deleted by mr BillCJ Sistematically

2Then i write in the talk up to 30kb then Akradecki moves the article to a draft

3NOBODY cares to work in this page except me I ask for help to other contributors the same that proposed the sandboxes and so on to confine me

4After several weeks have enough to be apartheidized and so i start to write it in the main page  

5Bzuk one of the guy with i have major problems and a arbcom case opened arrives swiftly and posed a lot of tags about the horrendous contributions

6Ahunt corrected them

7I notice that that process has cutted out several important parts of the article i posted 

8I add them WITHOUT revert all the work he did 

9Ahunt arrives and revert my adds

10I protest with this issue 

11Ahunt replies me that if i dont want to be edited my contributions then i do not post them

12I note that this is NOT a reply on my points but rather a bit trolling statement he says that since everyone can edit so every change deletion and worsening article is accepted while when i make edits on some articles i am reverted at will 

13BillCJ arrives to Akra talk page and complaint i offensed Ahunt

145 minuts after Akra blocked me for a week

15I request a unblock

16John swiftly denies it

17Since i am blocked for a week and in spite to not attack who is at ground this night Bzuk and Bill made more accusations on me in the Arbcom page 

18FInally Ahunt cames in the page i wrote F4 in world service 60kb long and start to complain this

Obviously i cannot reply in any sense and i cannot oppose to the consense Who cares if i am provocked who cares if i wrote 60 kb page for the sake of knowledge in wikien 

That matter is strike me and my work and you simply says that not matter When these other gentlemens will responsable of their actions When it will be clear that who provockes is not better than who answer to provocations

Until Wikipedia policies will not recognize mobbing situations like that stuff like wikilove are simply USELESS Just food for trolls spammers and vandals
