Suggestions for Improvement 

Introduction
The information presented in the introduction is a little scattered It jumps from the creation of the North West Company to competition with the Hudson Bay company and then all the way to its revival in 1990 There is very little explanation of the connections between these events especially the final sentence about its revival This makes the introduction more confusing than anything I suggest that either the introduction be extended in order to create a thoughtprocess that is easier to follow or eliminate the final sentence entirely since it doesnt really relate to the rest of the paragraph 

Before the Company
An explanation of the conquest of 1763 would be very useful it should not be assumed that someone looking up the North West Company is familiar with other events in Canadian history Even making it a link to another page would suffice 
Additionally a more detailed explanation of English and French expansion into western Canada would be beneficial 

Citations
Even though there is a large amount of detailed information here there are very little footnotes to back up the information This is a problem that I noticed throughout the article At times there are entire sections that have no citations whatsoever This damages the credibility of the information presented and the page as a whole
