The difference in perspective is in your saying that you are baffled by the link between terrorism and Iraq but no in the next say there was no significant link between Iraq and Al Qaeda So you imply that terrorism  Al Queda I would say that Iraq was one of the links in the chain or terrorism which is supported not simply by Usama pulling strings in Afghanistan but by a network of recruiters trainers financiers and sympathizers For a variety of reasons Iraq was a central link in this chain Perhaps I could put it this way When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the US went to war with Japan but it also went to war with Germany and Italy Hitler didnt attack the US Mussolini didnt attack the US Bu that they were Japans allies half a world away was enough    explains it all  7 July 2005 1618 UTC
