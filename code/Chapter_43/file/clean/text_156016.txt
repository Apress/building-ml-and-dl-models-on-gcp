Financial formula wrong 

The formula given for most profitable corporation ratio of profits over revenues is incorrect Under that formula stores like Walmart and Costco that have low markups would not be on the top of the list whereas a vitamin supplement dealer with a 90 markup would be higher despite the total absolute revenues or profit This definition just makes the article silly and it should be corrected
