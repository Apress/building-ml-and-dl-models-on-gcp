 Dave Please understand  WPHANOT I have asked reasonably and on the merits what actions by myself were the cause of a blocking by Gwen Gale which was removed by an uninterested admin  Gwen Gale is not an inexperience Wikipedian and is well able to articulate whether or not she will provide accountability for her blockage of an editor  I urge you to let her speak for herself and understand that I am asking appropriate questions to the blocking administrator
 If you would like to discuss this more I am open but please read WPHANOT first so you are up to speed Thank you for the feedback
