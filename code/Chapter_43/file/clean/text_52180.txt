Someone on a bicycle blog said they used aluminum foil and water to clean the steel parts of their bicycle and it seems to work quite well  I have also cleaned rust out of our steel wok which my wife tends to leave soaking in water grr  The rust disappears quite rapidly and the black oxidized aluminium polishes the steel as well    1744 18 June 2008
