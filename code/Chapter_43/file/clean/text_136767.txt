The page was made by Navdeep55 on 20 March 2007 and you Bal537 came on Aug 2008 and edited the text and added that Ramdasias are chamars I came after you and reverted back the false information provided by you You gave link references and I replied to your link references in talk page that you delete and added more link which i reverted back 

What is the point in  deleting Ramdasia Sikh Gotras and adding chamar link to it You also did the same in Jatt and khatirs sections where you projected them too  as chamar You say Ramdasia and Ravidasias are same which is false You can goto the most popular Matrimonial websites

Both have separate section for Ramdasia and Ravidasia  The Ramadsia Gotras are aslo different than Ravidasia Gotras 

Ramdasia Gotras Nar Badhan Rajju Rattu Heer

Ravidasia Gotras chumerChumberSinghmarSheemarJassal Jassy Kainth

The thing you are doing is the thing that most Ravidasias do ie pretend to be Ramdasia and then spread false info that both are same This can be see on matrimony websites where for eg  kainth and other listed Ravidasia castes people add themselves into Ramdasia section

You give references to chamar books and chamar websites and no neutral source that supports your view

The Fact Remains that  Ramdasia are weaversJulahas whereas Ravidasias are chamarsLeather tainersand both are not same at all
