Thanks and its good to hear from you both Ill keep plugging away and finish with the separate titles only 18 to go and well see whats what after that Once all of the individual pages are in position itll be easier to whittle here and add there to balance things out I agree its nice to see a small summary next to the title  I get these stories mixed up to tell the truth and can use something to jog my memory And it was very good to see that section Wolfes home added today  thats an important one So onward
