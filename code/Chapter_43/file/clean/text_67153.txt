Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island Origins of the Hela Race Hela was combination of Raksha Yaksha Deva Naga 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles At the time of start writing the history Raksha and Deva wasnt powerful Naga was the most powerful authorities That time only they had kingdoms It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna Others lived as small groups  kuvenis story 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya After 23 generations from Pandukabhaya kings tend to suffix Tissa and Naga to their names Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms  most probably Nagadeepa made connections to the royal family in Rajarata Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain NagaSinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king Those days without having clear power king cant survive Yakshas had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families Since conflicts between tribes hasnt been ended NagaSinha king wasnt be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas Ritigal Jayasena was one of them

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna SL was unified on tribe basis After SL was converted to buddhism it wasnt required to unify tribes which based on religion Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism due to fear for Asoka Rajarata king could made his brother  MahaNaga as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas
