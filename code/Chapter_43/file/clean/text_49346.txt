I would like to further clarify that the edit which I made yesterday was totally outside the issue of ongoing disagreement I made sure of that because I wanted Wolfkeeper exposed I knew he would delete it yet is was a very carefully thought out example which ilustrates both centrifugal force and Coriolis force perfectly

Now what has happened is that Itub and PhySusie are trying to justify Wolfkeepers actions and in doing so totally contradicting what has already been agreed

They are behaving like school children and I would simply lke to know if this is he best that I can expect from wikipedia Do the administration ever sort these cliques out or do they generally side up with the cliques out of fear of large numbers
