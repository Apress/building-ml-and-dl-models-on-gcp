Edit warring promotion of fringe views

Nuvola apps importantsvg You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war Note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24hour period Additionally users who perform several reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule When in dispute with another editor you should first try to discuss controversial changes to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors Should that prove unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection Please stop the disruption otherwise you may be blocked from editing

Your edits to macroevolution were promoting a viewpoint held by such a small minority among biologists as to fall under WPFRINGE guidelines Our articles have to conform with WPWEIGHT policy when it comes to showing such minority views You were also using AiG as a source  verification is required from a reliable third party source not from creationists promoting their own views Please discuss your proposals for changes on the article talk page and refrain from edit warring which is not the way to get anything in articles Thanks dave souza talk
