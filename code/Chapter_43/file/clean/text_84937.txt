I am starting to get confused Perhaps you could just tell me whatever it is that you tell yourself to justify not responding to me If you had a reasonable answer it would be best to just give it Ill repost the questions above incase youre unclear on what I would like answers too

has the community not gotten smaller 
was it not caused by the automobile 
have I not sourced the statement as asked 
is it not a fact 
is it not information 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not

and Ill just go ahead and add

Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article
If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better 
What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed
Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement

Ill also go ahead and post this on the disscussion board for Forsters Falls aswell

If you could try to treat me like a person and just respond to this post that would be great Wouldnt you want to get a response and if you can not in any way justify the edit perhaps you should consider the possibility that it was infact not justified and as such should be reverted maybe maybe any human can make mistakes 
Thank you so much Mr FromHell Ill see you tommorow unless I get an answer
