Comments  I consulted Dr Frank E Vandiver professor of history at Texas AM University and author of Black Jack The Life and Times of John J Pershing to find out if theres any truth to the above and he responded via email that in his opinion the story is apocryphal I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences he wrote This kind of thing would have run completely against his character

Similarly I been unable to find any evidence corroborating the claim that Muslims believe that eating or touching a pig its meat its blood etc is to be instantly barred from paradise and doomed to hell It is true that Islamic dietary restrictions like those of Judaism forbid the eating or handling of pork because pigs are considered unclean But according to Raeed Tayeh of the American Muslim Association in North America the notion that a Muslim would be denied entrance to heaven for touching a pig is ridiculous A statement from the AntiDefamation League characterized the claim as an offensive caricature of Muslim beliefs

In other words its just an urban myth though probably we might want to put it on as an Urban Myth
