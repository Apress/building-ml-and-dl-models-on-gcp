Igni on Dec 24 2006 I made some edits to the intro to correct some deficiences introduced by your uncertain grasp of the English language You reverted some of them with the comment providing adequate semantic naturalness for a clear yet simple pr√©cis which illustrates the point You are in love with the words but are a little fuzzy on the meaning and application of your tooextensive vocabulary No well educated native English speaker would use semantic to modify naturalness And the problem shows up in the opening phrase of your article Weimar Classicismis an oftdisputed cultural and literary movement of Europe Goethean above was either too gentle or ironic in pointing out the problem with this sentence albeit he was apparently addressing an earlier version Weimar Classicisms tenets may have been controversial but its existance as a movement is not so it is just as much an error to say it is oftdisputed as it was to say according to MANY historiana and scholars which implies that there are other historians and acholars who think it is something else or didnt exist at all I wish you all the best with your project but you need to be aware of this problem with your prose style in English  1420 18 January 2007
