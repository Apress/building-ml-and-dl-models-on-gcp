Biography vs movie plot
The shorter biography and in another timeline is not at all clear to anyone who didnt see the movie
Yes I agree with that but this isnt about the movie its about a character in the movie  If people want to know something specific about the movie they need to read the movie article  We dont want to waste the time of the reader with little details such as the entire paragraph that starts with When Marty travels back in time to 1955 instead of giving them what they are here for Learn about George McFly
