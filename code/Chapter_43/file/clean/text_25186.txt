Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities who state it is from La Fontaines Fables but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaines Nouvelles Contes The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer which I found illustrated at  Accessed  where it is described as follows

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaines Contes 178590Dark blue ground rich gilding of scrolls foliage trails and vases Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes identified in gilt writing on the underside on the cup la jument du compere pierre and on the saucer le diable de papefiguiere No marks Height of cup 61 cm diameter of saucer 129 cm Circa 178590

This cup is of the Sèvres gobelet litron shape Although unmarked the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period such as the Duc dAngoulêmes Dihl  Guérhard The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon but I think the story is less straightforward I havent found an English translation yet but it seems to me to be a variation of a wellknown folk theme in which Satandevildemons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple An English example would be the folk song The Devil and the Feathery Wife   Talk
