Pres George Bush says that reducing government spending is one of his highest priorities But most of his policies and actions have not been concerned with lowering spending So it would be inappropriate to devote large amounts of space in our bio of him on his philosophy of spending even though he may say its one of his most important beliefs Likewise with this former presidential candidate We should certainly mention the LRM and the Triple Curve but with so little coverage of them in sources we shouldnt give them excess weight
