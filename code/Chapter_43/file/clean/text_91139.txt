Could you help me perhaps  Im the Finkbeiner of the Finkbeiner test  Id this article to link to my original post  Right now it links to a repost of my post on another site  This subject has gotten a lot of attention and Im happy for Christie Aschwanden and Double XX Science to get most of it  But would you mind adding this link httpwwwlastwordonnothingcom201301175266  The title of the original post is What Im Not Going To Do

I tried to do this myself but my html skills are rudimentary  As is not even there

Thank you for considering it

Ann Finkbeiner
