Thanks Bugs I trust in my response to your comment that you if not others understood the reference to nonsense as this false accusation to be the accusation not made by you of making a gender based insult rather than your comment being nonsense754195159  

Thanks Doc one gots to like a detail guy the refernce to guy being intended as gender neutral I should like to characterize it as trying to get an answer and redirecting the topic back to that topic not without personal failures along the way of getting an answer rather than pestering Though when someone doesnt want to answer the ontopic question and only responds with condescending stonewalling I have no doubt that the pony would characterize the May fly as pestering her

The other points you make and more you raise in your second post run down a path that in avoiding a failure to stay on topic we shouldnt take As to Dayewalkers gender if Dayewalker or one of Dayewalkers friends or acquaintances would simply state that Dayewalker wishes to be referred to by the male or female personal pronoun that works for me I dont care which Dayewalker actually is Whichever they wish to have used here is fine Until then and basing my guess on the name alone and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalkers words or actions I have referred to Dayewalker as a she If that is not the correct gender just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun If Carol OConner could live with his name and constant gender misidentification one hopes that an adult with the name Dayewalker should realize people are going to offer up their best guess at what gender pronoun to use
 
I did having noted your apparent yet vague complaint searched via Google The first result for Dayewalker is to someone named Chris on Twitter No help there Chris could be male could be female The next one of any potential was someone named Daye Walker so thats promising Maybe Dayewalker is Daye Walker Makes sense I cant know for sure but it appears that Daye Walker is a woman as Daye Walker puts another name that would appear to be a maiden family name in parenthesis However in a modern age that may not be what she is indicating by this choice of presenting her name nor is that taking of ones spouses family name upon marriage universal to either gender But why guess when someone could simply state the fact Unless one perfers to create issues and avoid answering the ontopic question posed754195159  

The topic is about including facts in a biographical page on Wikipedia The question posed by Chowbok remains unanswered
