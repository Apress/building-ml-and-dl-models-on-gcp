Yep LOL the Reformist Party SerbiaReformist Party is having another go the 20th very last on the parliamentary election winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned  
By the way heres something very little people have figured out  the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo secession The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility and after the Kumanovo MilitaryTechnical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed causing new elections  because that was unconstitutional as an act of highest treason enough to be tried from maximum sentence which the Radicals demanded from then to his death to have a trial in Serbia and to be tried for treason among other reasons This constitution releases the authorities from that weight and they wont have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo    15
