Ranchi in Jharkhand 
No need to write NOW Ranchi was in Bihar or it is in Jharkhand edited where described about Garib Nawaz Rath Guddu 

 Deification 
Wow this article seems to make a local god out of Laloo Yadav while SYSTEMATICALLY ignoring or underestimating his negative sideshim being a curse upon  India Silly rare articles have been quoted praising him while blatantly ignoring his long time image among the educated Indian middle class and the media Everybody just seems to have a bias against himwhat an excuse All these constitute serious breach of Wikipedias NPOV I have added in the intro that he is known for his castebased politics his corruption and his primary mass appeal lies among the socalled backward castes and I will not tolerate its removal 

I second this comment Cygnus_hansa couldnt have been more concise and accurate when he said he is known for his castebased politics his corruption and his primary mass appeal lies among the socalled backward castes  Preceding unsigned comment added by 758215773   

This Wikipedia biography seems to be prepared by a staunch fan of Lau Prasad A much more balanced picture should be presented that should also throw light on his negative impact on the polity and economy of Bihar which lost precious 15 years of development opportunity under his rule which has been often called jungle raj or Jungle Rule A more clear and focussed biography should expose him for a petty corrupt politician with criminal antecedents that he really is  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

 Name 

According to the official profile of Lalu Yadav from bhiar his name is Lalu Prasad NOT Lalu Prasad Yadav http16410024208lslsmemberbiodataaspmpsno2439  even his fathers name does not have Yadav in it

Education Qualification
I dont think he is a complete illiterate Can someone add that to this article
Thanks  talk  
From what I have heard he is a graduate BA LLB from Patna University but this is not confirmed The article certainly does not provide a balanced view of Lalu again which is not his actual name Lakshmi Prasad 
Yes I agree this article has too many hyperboles It would be difficult to confirm his educational qualification given that the person pretends to be rustic in public As per Indian Government records his name as Lalu Prasad the issue has been discussed above  

 POV 

I am placing a POV and cleanup tag here because this article is partial to Lalu has unreferenced statements and some very misleading references The article does not mention his corruption cases misrule of Bihar and controversies enough I dont have the time but someone is requested to clean it up  

I think your understanding of Lalu Prasad Yadav is based on the media which has already been claimed in the article to be biased I think the article is not at all partial to Lalu Prasad Yadav and at the same time need further improvement I find that some of the editors are biased against Lalu Prasad yadav which is reflected from some of the edits intending personal attack on him   

Wikipedia is full of people like cygnus hansa especially in Indian circle many of them had got banned earlier but some seems to be surviving to this date This guy has also left some uncivil remarks on my talk page I am deleting another libelous comment by anon noblast
