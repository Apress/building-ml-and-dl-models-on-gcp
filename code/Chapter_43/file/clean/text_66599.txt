I have to say the entire Criticism section is at the very least quite dubious After reading what is on this talk page and the transparent criticism linked to in the parent page I should mention the criticism is hardly anything but puerile ranting it appears as if someone perhaps a wiki administrator dislikes Mr Garrett and is blatently obvious in his attempts to discredit him The dubious mark should be added back to the Criticism section until the dispute is settled
