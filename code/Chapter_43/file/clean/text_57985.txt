Constantine of Berat 

Hello Moonriddengirl In 2009 you seem to have deleted Constantine of Berat on the grounds of copyrights infringement I immagine that the relative article of Robert Elsie was copied motamot Can you please give me a copy of that article so that I can check whether there is anything I can save from it before I start it myself Thanks Regards
