You erroneously deleted my file 

You deleted a file I had uploaded Axial1jpg on the grounds that it was not in use Problem was it was in use in the article that I was working on Akira Kurosawa and was visible in that article from the day I uploaded the file together with two companion images similarly titled that were also uploaded and are still visible in the article today I forgive you but please dont do this again

Regards
