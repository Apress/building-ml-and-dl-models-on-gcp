RE RexxS That wasnt what I said  My concern is that Sasata has said Its pretty obvious I dont think it meets the criteria 3a comprehensiveness and its also pretty obvious that we have different opinions about the comprehensiveness criterion In its current state I would fail on that basis  In agreeing with her opinon do you agree with her statement about comprehensiveness  My expertise and the reviewers expertise in this field are not at issue the issue is the misapplication of assessment criteria  Such as issue is independent of the topic of the article
