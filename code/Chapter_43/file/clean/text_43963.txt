We have a rare situation here WPAEBLOCK states that you should either email the blocking administrator contact ArbCom or when the reviewing administrator decides to initiate a discussion on the matter The first option is out because the blocking administrator is no longer an admin so you are left with the latter two options Personally I think your unblock request is reasonable and thus a community discussion may be your quickest route as arbcoml will likely take a few days to get a response which by then your block will already be over Let me know what you want to do  The clock is ticking
