LOL Well I was about to post this to the ANI thread below in response to Bbb23s 3RR analogy It seems a shame to let it go to waste particularly as it seems it was very prescient

Heres an even better analogy User A makes 4 reverts in 24 hours without a valid reason User B tells him that was a violation of 3RR and not to do it again User A tells him it wasnt and gives a whole list of gobbledygook links as some kind of justification for the reverts which to any normal user looks like nonsense borne out of fundemental failure to understand both 3RR and all the other links they threw out there User A then proceeds to make 4 further reverts User B tells him hes incompetent and advises them to buck their ideas up User A gets upset and comes to ANI User B has done nothing wrong so stands by his actions Users CDEFGH form a kangaroo court and while expressing no concern whatsoever about user A proceed to focus solely on User B full of their own self importance at their chance to fuck over someone with heavy doses of selective hearingreading Probable outcome User B a productive editor decides that Wikipedia is a basket case with completely backwards priorities and is lost to the project forever either through force or by his choice User A continues to be an incompent editor messes up a whole bunch more articles and propogates his poor understanding of policy to even less experienced users by spreading it all over random talk pages Long term User A either finally learns the ropes having no doubt destroyed an unknowable amount of content and confused an unknowable amount of inexperienced editors in the meantime or they screw up and they get blocked after applying their incompetence to a disupte which involves some power user or other and finally gets the block they deserve still no doubt not having any idea what theyve done wrong because heres the kicker  they have been incompetent all along   

With that Im out of here You all have fun now editting articles while others who dont know a BLP from a loaf of bread get in your way and when you highlight it its dismissed as nothing but a content dispute Good job everyone
