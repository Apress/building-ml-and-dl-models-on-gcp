Clown COTW 

Greetings once again to members of the best encyclopedia online about Oregon aka WPORE Last week we improved Neil Goldschmidt to close to GA level and moved the Wells Fargo Center from Stub to Start for the Collaboration of the Week This week were clowning around with some bozo from Oregon Pinto Colvig and then in an attempt to garner another DYK the rather stubby Cooper Spur As always any contribution is appreciated and to opt out of these messages visit here

As we have quite a few new members over the last six months Ill make another pitch for our various subprojects Listed here you will find a variety of groups focused on specific areas of Oregon from transportation to culture Not only can you sign up and coordinate work there but each often has useful sources and templates related to that topic No pressure just an introduction to those new to the project Adios
