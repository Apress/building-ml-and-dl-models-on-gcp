list

Whats the point of that third table being there its all old data from 20034 on the ppp per capita article there no point That guy just wont listen because he is in love with old data and doesnt like new data he needs to add a love heart to the third table to show his love for the old data lol It was so better when there were just two lists IMF  CIA only when that guy added a third table and now the article looks really squashed with three tables you gotta move on in life you cant come back to old data from 4 5 years ago but he wont listen his love will never go for that table

Goodbye
