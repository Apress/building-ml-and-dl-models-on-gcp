Thanks Lardont really need the nanny lecture  If you choose to adhere to internal editorial standards that are detached from reality and you defend your editorial decisions accordingly in the public domain then you should expect to be criticized for it  Ill let my points stand alongside those what Ive written and let others judge and discount my arguments for civility points for themselves  I think Ive had enough of your condescencion anyway so Ill let this go and let someone else pick it up  If you want to try to block me anyway Ill just smile squint my eyes to reciprocate the dollop of conceit youve given me today and say THANKS72244113169
