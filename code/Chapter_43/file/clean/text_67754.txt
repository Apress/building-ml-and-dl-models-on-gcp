I received a notification of this discussion on my phone on my home from work I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention Its about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years which the article completely ignores It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO many years ago supported vaccine development Im not convinced that there is much here  once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed  that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine  While I applaud the contributors enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered I dont think this contribution is worthy of a stand alone article and certainly not a GA
