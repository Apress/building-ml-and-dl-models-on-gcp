Microbrewery
When the first sentence says Creemore Springs was a microbrewery located in it instantly suggests that the brewery no longer exists While I understand that the author is trying to imply that Creemore would no longer be considered a microbrewery due to their ownership structure and level of production I dont think this is the best wording As a result I have changed the first sentence to Creemore Springs is a brewery
