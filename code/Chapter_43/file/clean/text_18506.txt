The concept of home video could be approached from an ontological perspective as well It is unrelenting footage that rolls on and on It has an aimless determination a persistence that lives outside the subject matter You are looking into the mind of home video It is innocent it is aimless it is determined it is real Don Delillo Underworld p 156

the home video business focus seems to represent only the commercial aspects
