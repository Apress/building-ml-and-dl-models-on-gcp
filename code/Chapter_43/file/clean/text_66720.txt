Hi I dont like the formal notice above but it covers the relevant things you need to know so I guess it will do However the problem here is that the original image on Flickr was released under a noncommercial license Thus we cant accept it without a fair use claim as were restricted only to CC images that allow commercial use Nice picture but given that we already have an image of Julia Gillard I dont think we can claim fair use on it
