There was no section of GKIF There was however a section called The other Genseiryu style that showed how this new Genseiryu style came alive according to WGKF  At the end of the paragraph there is a reference to GKIF and people can go there to read further However WGKF believes that the story of GKIF is wrong and is only told in that way so they can promote themselves better The true history NEEDS to be told in the article about WGKF Its their viewpoint and therefore important information for an understanding of the way WGKF thinks trains and deals with the situation The story on the GKIF page is their viewpoint and I think they will find it important to tell this story for their own reasons 
I will see how this story can be rewritten but it cannot be discarded totally from WGKF
