Not at all you are making a straw man argument here I never claimed ODonohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position which is exactly what the quote says and also something ODonohue agrees with 

Again I was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation Since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd The disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do At the end of the day it is a value judgment as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement If we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis
