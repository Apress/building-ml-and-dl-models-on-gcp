Regarding  

Hi there I note you have had a few runins with Pigsonthewing  Whilst it is known he is a disruptive editor as per previous arbcom it is not helpful to blank his requests on your talk page  You do not need to respond  they will be archived anyway  Most users know what he is like and will not take it against you but it can inflame hm further and it just gives him more to argue about

I actually find it quite amusing that he is so upset by it as he has done the same to me on many occasions he will probably remove that warning as well  Just leave him be and remember he only has one revert per article per week  wotI did
