ServantofAllah93 you continue to make diplomatic statements but you are also continuing to revert the article for example this edit at 0049 on 3 October This must not continue I recommend that you take a break of at least 48 hours from all editing of the article Zakir Naik regardless of how wrong you may think it to be Make your case for any changes at TalkZakir Naik and wait for others to reach a conclusion Thank you
