Re minor orders 

With respect the Eastern Churches consider them part of the Sacrament of Holy Orders I realise the Western Church doesnt How do we work this one out   

 I dont think Eastern Catholics view ordination to lector as a sacrament like baptism Yes it shares in the sacrament of orders but the minor orders are not treated the same as deacon priest and bishop Do you have a source which clearly calls the minor orders sacraments Gimmetrow
