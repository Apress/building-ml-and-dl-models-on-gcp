Im Juli DVD cover 

Im not sure I understand the justification for this removal  The image was the US DVD cover which should be no less fairuse than the original German cover  I hadnt logged in for a while so the file was deleted before I could catch it therefore I cant be sure whether the file had the appropriate fair use templates but I seem to remember it did and I thought the usual action would have been to tag the file rather than remove it  Is there a new policy about fair use DVD covers
