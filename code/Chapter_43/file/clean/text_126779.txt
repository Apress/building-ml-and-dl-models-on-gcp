Thanks for the quick reply I wish that could be explained in some guideline so all editors will will handle it conistently So should that paranthetical explanation you added about WilliamsPaisley be used only in the Cast section and not in the infobox What if there is no Cast section Also what if the persons name is mentioned mutliple times throughout an article about one their movies or TV shows Would you just use the last name they used when filming in every instance
