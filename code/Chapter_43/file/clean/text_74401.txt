Since you are an anonymous IP with no edits other than the one on my talk page I doubt you will come back to read my response Nevertheless I do not fully understand the reasoning behind your complaint You are implying that I maliciously removed links to club websites in order to sever contact between clubs and their members This is not the case I removed them because they are nothing more than advertising If we were to include links to two clubs then it would be logical that we should link to all of them I am simply following guidelines specified in What Wikipedia is not Wikipedia is not a place to promote things regardless of whether the thing being promoted is a charitable club a political party or a product Wikipedia is also not a search engine in that people looking to join a particular lifesaving club or find its website would be better advised to use Google or another search engine

Therefore I feel that my removal of the links was in keeping with the Guidelines of Wikipedia If you or someone else feels that they should be there for one reason or another then you have every right to put them back and I will not go out of my way to take them out again if you have a genuine reason why they should be included in the article
