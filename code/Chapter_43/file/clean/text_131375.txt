Sam you should know better than to make unexplained deletions
Now why is it you think this information is POV It is certainly true that many Americans believe that pyramid and EyeOProv are on the one dollar bill as a result of the influence of Freemasonry on the founding fathers So the only real question is whether these are in fact Masonic symbols We have two references from Masonic web sites which say they are not To counter the argument we would need to find a credible reference that says they are
Im not an expert on the iconography of the Freemasons but I have taken the time to look into it and to be honest the explanation on the Rosslyn Templars site rings true The unfinished pyramid or even a completed pyramid doesnt appear to be a symbol used by the Masons The triangle pentagram and the obelisk are but the pyramid isnt On the whole Masons use a semicircular glory usually with extended rays from the base You can find examples of full glories as in the Sun Face above but I havent seen any full glories surrounding the EyeOProv nor an EyeOProv enclosed in a triangle  although these were Christian symbols
There is a chance that William Barton on drawing the Great Seal was trying to please Benjamin Franklin and if you are into conspiracy theories no doubt other behindthescenes Masons But if so it appears he got his symbols mixed up  and it would be surprising that controlling Masons didnt set him right Alternatively I might suggest that the Masons were still busy inventing their traditions and symbols at the same time that the Great Seal was being created Both drew on symbols and ideas that were popular at the time and thats about it
There is good evidence for Masonic involvement in the erection of the Washington Monument but then thats an obelisk   2032 18 Jun 2005 UTC
