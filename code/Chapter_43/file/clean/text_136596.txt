Notre Dame Fighting Irish football under Tyrone Willingham GA Review 

Hello I will be doing the GA review for this article The quickfail criteria do not apply to this article so the review will go forward I like to review a little differently than many editors I post my concerns on the talk page as I find them so that people can fix them before the review is complete I usually have time to review a section or two at a time so I dont see any need to make the nominator wait until Ive gone through everything and posted a full review If you have a chance to fix the concerns feel free to do so any time If not they will be included in my final review I have posted a few initial observations on the talk page from a quick glance over the article Best wishes
