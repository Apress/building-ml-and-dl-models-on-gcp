user zora i have no interest in hearing what user moshe has to say the best way to deal with people like her is to ignore them Now once again you have reverted eminent to distinguished even after agreement Because of this like i said before there is no more discussion here we already came to an agreement and the word eminent stays if bridesmill and moshe dont like that thats their problem
Furthermore moshe i have repeatedly asked you to cooperate again i have no hate for you and do not want to engage in a war here but i will not let you vandalize it either like we talk about it before why cant you just be like the russianjewish sweet girl i had lol same goes for bridesmill
