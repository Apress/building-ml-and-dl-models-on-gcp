MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty

My name is Jonathan Obar userJaobar Im a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundations Education Program This semester Ive been running a little experiment at MSU a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators Not a lot is known about your community  and our students who are fascinated by wikiculture by the way want to learn how you do what you do and why you do it A while back I proposed this idea the class to the community HERE where it was met mainly with positive feedback Anyhow Id like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences training motivations likes dislikes etc We were wondering if youd be interested in speaking with one of our students

So a few things about the interviews
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes
 Interviews can be conducted over skype preferred IRC or email You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level time etc
 All interviews will be completely anonymous meaning that you real name andor pseudonym will never be identified in any of our materials unless you give the interviewer permission to do so
 All interviews will be completely voluntary You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSUs institutional review board ethics review This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly

Bottom line is that we really need your help and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you If interested please send me an email at obarmsuedu to maintain anonymity and I will add your name to my offline contact list If you feel comfortable doing so you can post your name  instead

If you have questions or concerns at any time feel free to email me at obarmsuedu I will be more than happy to speak with you

Thanks in advance for your help We have a lot to learn from you

Sincerely

Jonathan Obar
