Editing paragraphs without reading their sources 

Caper13 you have repeatedly edited paragraphs of the Rush Limbaugh article that you admittedly have not read the sources for As can be expected this has the end result of making it so that the paragraphs do not say what the sources say This has the effect of both putting misinformation into the article as well as attributing the misinformation to the source This is not acceptable You cant write encyclopedia articles based on what you wish sources said You cant attribute things to sources that they never said Including your unsourced misinformation is not appropriate and sourcing it major news organizations makes your edits even worse I will continue to correct this As the top of the talk page dsays Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately Please try to edit this article based on what sources actually report rather than your own personal point of view
