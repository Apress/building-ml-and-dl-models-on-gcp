You must mean your own errors Mantey
1 You seem unable to even quote the correct link to the paper It is

2 Again you cant even quote my formulas correctly 

3 The Maxwell equations that you keep clamaoring for are embedded in the text You need a much better knowledge of physics to recognize them Hint ever heard of Kirchoffs laws No It is obvious that you havent

So Mantey you have your answers
