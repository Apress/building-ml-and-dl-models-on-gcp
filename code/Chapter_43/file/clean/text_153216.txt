Clearly some have an emotional or economic interest in minimising or even denying the importance of these consumeroriented blind tasting competitions 

The Emperor Has No Clothes

The owners of 30 of  the best wines in the world in the judgment of a Champagne company president were invited to a party in 1997 The event was organized by JeanClaude Rouzaud to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his presidency of Champagne Louis Roederer Half of his selections were from France Im a chauvinist and a nationalist he explained 

Before agreeing to participate the Bordeaux first growths set some conditions the foremost being that no comparative tasting with their international competition would be held They didnt even want to be included in a group photo with their colleagues from other wine regions although they finally reluctantly agreed  But getting the Bordelais to have their wines served with the others that was out of the question said a Roederer spokesperson

So the event took place in two separate parts first a dinner featuring the Bordeaux wines then a tasting the next day with all the other wines but no Bordeaux 

They are cowards said a nonBordeaux producer  But the host said  I understand them He explained that  They feel that when you are first growths you are untouchable Their problem is that they actually know better

They and the other named growth vineyards have a carefully cultivated  image of  superiority This is a marketing advantage worth an incredibly enormous sum of money every year However they frequently fail to perform well in blind comparisons and realize how vulnerable they are to exposure and the destruction of their vaulted  and very valuable reputations 

Because of this the named growths  1 want to avoid  comparisons  and 2 try to discredit  the results of such comparisons  Who can blame them Those results can cost them a fortune in lost revenue But the consumer benefits immensely
