Waverly place has not been a successful shopping center for a long time 15 years The deign is too pedestrian friendly and thus not as well suited for cars The have also been problems deciding what sort of character the plaza should have and what sort of stores should be in the plaza Also it doesnt help that there is a WalMart across the street and a large mall that is less than ten minutes away
