I dont know very much about the unification timeline in those countries or about the corresponding articles I do know that Leti would have described himself as Milanese when in France Britain or Amsterdam and not as Italian I acknowledge that there is a lot of anachronism on Wikipedia but have the naieve hope that it can be avoided at least in the articles that I work on and will eventually be fixed elsewhere I feel like most people on the English Wikipedia know that Milan is in Italy so we arent doing them a diservice by being more specific In short just because other articles are less precise in their style is no reason to perpetuate that style Also I am not entirely sure that the situation is as dire as you describe it in other areas For example most residents of Burgundy are refered to as Burgundian rather than French
