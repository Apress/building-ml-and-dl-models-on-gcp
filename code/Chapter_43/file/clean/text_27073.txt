In my opinion youre confusing different policies You say that everything you write there is sourced for the sake of the argument I shant dispute that even though a very good point is raised there regarding the difference between sourced and attributed However sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedias policy on verifiability Soapboxing advocating and giving undue weight on the contrary are not permitted under Wikipedias policy on neutrality So even if everything you state there is sourced it still cant be included if it violates WPNPOV
Its not a matter of not liking what sources have to say its just that they are only opinions I dont think criticism should be hidden or Amandas guilt taken for granted Actually I dont even know if she did it because quite frankly I never studied the case but Im convinced that if a Court of law convicted her there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that Italys not Soviet Russia My point is that the article shouldnt mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guedes reputation by implying that he was a lone killer as that primarily violates WPBLP Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda As Ive said I agree that criticism should be reported it is notable and rather easily sourced However that should not be the focus of the article 
Finally as I wrote on the articles page technically the trial record is publicly avalaible but that doesnt mean that it was actually accessed or published even in Italian for that matters     Lets talk bout it
