Hi I didnt removed the AVGN links on Back to the future video game i added IG review i think that for the sake of neutrality both reviews must or must not appear in the article

Regarding TMNT3 AVGN is not a professional movie reviewer including his links in this article is just spam to atract more views to james rolfe account by the way i like the videos of both AVGN and IG but i think that the AVGNfans are abusing the wikipedia rules and integrity
