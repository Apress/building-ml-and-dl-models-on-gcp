Thanks for your note Ive been reporting accounts like these for over a year now and they all almost always get an indefinite block since they are vandalism only accounts Blocks are necessary in these cases as it is not known when any person behind these accounts may come back and vandalize again I see you have again removed these reports from the noticeboard which I have to again disagree with therefore I kindly request you to put them back on the noticeboard for another administrator to review  talk
