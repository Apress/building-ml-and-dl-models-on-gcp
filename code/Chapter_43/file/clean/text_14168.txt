Ssssh Be Very Very Quiet its Oregon COTW time 

Howdy folks its time for this weeks edition of Oregons Collaboration of the Week First off great job the last two weeks with Greg Oden  the Hospital red link drive We had close to ten new hospital articles and two DYKs  plus other improvements to the list itself So thank you to those who helped out This week we have on a sad note Kevin Duckworth and the Statesman Journal Duckworth should have plenty of sources so hopefully in tribute we can get his article up to standards With the SJ hopefully we can get it above a stub so all three of the top three papers are no longer stubs and maybe even a DYK and GA like we got from the RegisterGuard Once again click here to opt out of these messages or click here to make a suggestion for a future COTW Hasta la bye bye
