Firstly I was unaware that Mr Walter had any actual pull inside the AAFS being under ethics investigation hismelf since at least 1995 for his various frauds Secondly I have NEVER been investigatd by the AAFS for any misconduct Third if anything that you have stated here about me were true   I would not survive a single moment in court under oath As it stands Richard Walter is the one allowing anonymous editors and phony web articles to be disseminated to whitewash his fraud and falsehood while under oath and he is the one lacking te ability to show his face in court The AAFS ethics committee has been made aware of the situation He will be hearing from them  again
