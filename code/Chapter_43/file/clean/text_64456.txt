unblockSubjective Offenses 
Listen I actually tried to use those forums of discussion and it was deemed harassment all I did was ask Roland to answer his continued edits and why they were offensive something you have only answered halfway yourself When you have such a subjective means of determining the truth and particularly of deeming which forms of interaction are condoned its no wonder you have users being punished for nonexistent or inexplicable offenses I am not a malicious user I am merely positing a position of my own one as subjective as Rolands I will source my contributions to the page just as everyone else has but you need to provide me with the opportunity to do so Telling me stop blathering when Ive presented a reasonable complaint one which was initially accepted before several editors decided to gang up on me after the fact is not an intellectually honest way to deal with dissenting viewpoints Thank you for reading this and Im sorry to see that this site is so dismissive of people willing to contribute PARTICULARLY to a contentious topic like the one I was accused of vandalising without an explanation of why my edits were considered vandalism but reasserting a blatantly biased POV was not
