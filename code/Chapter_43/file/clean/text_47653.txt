Major changes to Arsenicum album without discussion but with deceptive edit summaries 

Neither this edit nor this edit were discussed on the talk page of the article contrary to edit summary Editor making said edits is under an unblockmentorship agreement though it appears their mentor has taken a break The terms of the most recent unblockmentorship was that the editor may only make significant changes anything past typo fixes spelling corrections etc after you have reached a consensus on the talk page I am unwilling to deal further with disruptive single purpose editorsforprofit with conflicts of interest so I leave it to someone else to even engage in discussions regarding this
