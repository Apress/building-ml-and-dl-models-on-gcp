Randall the problem with the cited articles is that they dont actually name any groups or individuals or provide any actual examples of the said myths Now I assume that the leg wounds article is mostly addressing the SCA who are known for fighting from their knees and not targeting the lower legs but how is the ordinary reader supposed to know that All they get from the link is vague intimations that somebody somewhere thinks fighting from the knees is realistic The other cited article is even less specific
Ideally to cite a mythmisconception you should link to an actual case of someone stating that myth  eg an article stating that swords weighed 30 lbs  and then to a rebuttal article or to an article that gives the source of the misconception as well as a rebuttal Otherwise the reader has no way of knowing that the articles are actually addressing a real argument rather than knocking down straw men
