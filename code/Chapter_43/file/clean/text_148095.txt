Collapsed and Closed Sections 

Whats been going on here is people pointing out that legitimate and notable criticism of her knowledge of video games that Anita does not meet notability standards as no credible sources nothing even close to a peer reviewed journal have praised her work and a bunch of long time editors have said No criticism allowed because she awesome Go away

The reason her work will never find its way into a psychology journal is because it is complete BS There is a huge difference between toys made for boys and toys made for girls because corporations have done extensive market research and design to taste It has nothing to do with a conspiracy against women that has been successful for thousands of years across every culture known to history The fact that Anita wants girls to play games made for boys doesnt make her relevant it makes her a fighter of reality as well as a hypocrite

She recently expressed her anger at video game makers for including female characters but used a bow on their heads to distinguish them even though old school graphics left few options and ignored the fact that modern video games are able to make females distinct in many ways Yes bows were used to distinguish females because women are into accessories They could have used I dont know giant hoop earrings If Anita is as adamant as she claims she needs to free her ears of the great patriarchys brand and shave her head

What about little boys who want to play with dolls and My Little Pony They get teased much worse than girls who want to play video games made for boys I guess thats because theyre not manly enough so its still girls who are being oppressed

The idea that men and women should be treated equally in the workplace is one thing but the idea that men and women dont have fundamentally different tastes and are the victims of an ancient conspiracy to convince us all that we do is a bunch of BS that will never be taken seriously by any professional journal This is why Anita is an irrelevant nobody and proven liar I love video games Im not a fan of video games and doesnt deserve a page beyond the incident where she played the victim and was given a bunch of money I know go away2098984174
