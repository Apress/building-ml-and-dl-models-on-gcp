Other Asian References  This Matsuda tour also went to Indonesia and I can find almost indecipherable references on what looks like Indonesian google and wikipedia But while researching the topic I discovered why his appearance in the 1990 Disney movie Newsies was so notable  He is chinese and his appearance in the movie became a milestone in that he was an Asian playing in a nonstereotyped role As an early role model for Asian actors I can see that there ia a hollywood social group called Team Yellow and they seem to all be friends and have dinners once a year But beyond discussion on social sites I fear I cannot find news material on this topic A further Asian reference that also involves his modelling career is that he is the model used in Photographer David LaChappelles current exposition on Chinese Pop Culture and Bruce Lee which opened in Hong Kong just last month There is a video on his site of David LaCapelle making these works and the David LaChapelle site on the Hong Kong Show has the pieces available for online viewing However I dont think links to the video and a viewing of the show pieces is enough and would have to find news articles about the show in Hong Kong journals As I continue researching this article I am truly impressed by the vast variability in this mans career   Gmccombs
