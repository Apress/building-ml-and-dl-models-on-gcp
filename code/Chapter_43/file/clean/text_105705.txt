I understand what you mean but there has been a misunderstanding my fault for sure I didnt call ignorant in the same meaning of moron A person with an IQ  60 is hopeless an ignorant can always learn I explained that I attributed to ignorant a very specific meaning that of being unaware not knowing Which I dont see as an insult in itself I am myself ignorant of an incredible amount of things while instead I dont think to be a moron while I know I can have poor judgement from time to time As to make the encyclopedia poorer well I think they do it in good faith but they nevertheless do it Yes I understand it sounded insulting and I should have kept a cooler head after TTs remark But I thought to have been clear
I still disagree on your action a serious final warning on my talk page could have been enough to let me understand but I understand you did it for good and in fact it will help me as a reminder to think twice before typing I also hope youll think twice before blocking in the future No bad feelings talk
