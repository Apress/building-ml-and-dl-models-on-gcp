The Raven  resource link 

  

Hi can you please restore my links to how they were I dont see that Im breaking any rules considering that both articles already feature links to products and companies such as the short film adaptation of The Raven Both of my links  that you have removed  are very much related examples to the subject of the two articles They are not ads but user submitted content to the article Please restore them or reason your actions  thank you   

Its commercial linkspamWikipedia is not a place to advertise your product Those sites that are linked to a product for sale are removed Those sites that link to reviews and reliable sources are not  

First of all its not my product Can you explain to me how Official site of the 2003 short film version by Trilobite Pictures constitutes as a reliable source You cant just exclude everything that involves money The Raven by vNovel Interactive happens to be a great resource for studying the poem I happen to know this from firsthand experience as a reader I still dont agree with your censorship Please clarify your point of view   

Ive moved this conversation to your talk page for your convenience
