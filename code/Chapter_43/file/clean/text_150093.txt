Hi Hope you didnt mind the email  I was undergoing major Wikiwithdrawal  and thought Id share  Would appreciate Feedback on POV on Treaty of Shimonoseki   my attempt to be balanced may need expanded into greater length Please post to the talk there Thanx 
Also need a memory check Did I write you asking that you take over Organosulfur compounds  which I stubbed as far as 27 yo chemistry will take me Or was that one of the messages I lost the other night No matter heres another handoff  Looks to me that Hydrogen Sulfide needs some serious attention as well I was a Chem major myself once upon a yesterday No hurry from me
Also seem to have put this laptop into a zoomed in screen mode  Text is about double sized from what Id normally viewed and my office and other computers are unaffected Would be better to have this mode on the big screen upstairs vice this dinky 14 screen Any ideas of how that might happen The touch pad does some weird things and how to reverse it Its wikirelated as does not apply to other internet windows  Thanx  FrankB
