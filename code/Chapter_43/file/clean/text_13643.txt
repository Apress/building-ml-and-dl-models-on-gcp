Esteban Cambiasso again 

Dear KylieTastic
Thank you for your reply to my query about why you accused me of making edits on a page that I had never even visited Yes you are right I do access Wikipedia from the O2 UK mobile network BUT  Wikipedia has now blocked EVERYONE using this network from making edits This is crazy I have NEVER done anything wrong or vandaliam on your site I am a writer and some time ago someone put completely incorrect information on one of your pages because they had completely misread one of my books At that time I was able to edit and so was able to change the awful remarks of the idiot who had written them But now I am blocked  through no fault of my own  and therefore if someone else does the same thing I am now unable to answer This is terrible What is Wikipedia doing These blanket blocks are ridiculous and completely TOTALLY unfair
