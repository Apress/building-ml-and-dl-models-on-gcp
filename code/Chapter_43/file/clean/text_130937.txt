That whole sentenceineacharticle has to be revisited Its the strangest thing I have ever come across Wikipedia Templating dozens of articles with some newfangled verbiage with RSs not on the direct subject It violates all kinds of wikipolicies let alone that no other encyclpedia has anything similar Then editors are blocked if they dont follow the guideline Its really wacko Where is this discussion anyway I found this discussion about proposal to add the word settlement into the first sentence of dozens of article and that failed as no consensus How and where did this happen crewer yada yada
