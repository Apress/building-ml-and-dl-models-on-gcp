ReCritics 

Yes you have a very good point Im am truely sorry for what I have done but I just hate it when people act so stupid and dont know anything on the subject and yet they contribute to it anyway by putting their false information on it 

I sort of disagree with you about my Montenegrin I truely do understand it and know how to write it but I am writing in nonstop English that I am forgetting some words and how to phrase out the words 

Yes I do have pride in my Montenegrindom but my actions have led me to downgrade that pride on wikipedia From now on I am neutral on many matters If I know about a topic and write about it I want people to agree me not to go against me 

Also I am terribly sorry for critisizing you for being a Serb nationalist and using too many proSerb sources when I know you try to stay neutral I just had this bad hunch that you may be at it again while reviewing the talk page on the Duklja article 

You and anyone else may critisize me all you want and I will stop critizising you and any other person And yes I can get pissed off very easily at times but I let it go until I really get ticked when the person who is pissing me off does it constantly

Well I see that youre making great hunches on these sockpuppets though I wouldnt want to go too far with this Well anyways I just wanted to clear things Thanks again Bye
