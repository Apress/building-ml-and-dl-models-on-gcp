Resoulution 

That was real cute reporting me to wikipedia Whatever But obviously you did read the article you submitted to me We have to come to a resolution I obviously want the work I submitted included in Triple Hs page you do not So I suggest we keep the information in Triple Hs page however you can edit it however you want without totally omitting it because oviously want change The reason I wanted this included is to totally show a conclusion to the Triple H and Batista feud The fact about what happened during the posthell in a cell match is a little fact that many may not know This was not fake information if that is what you are worried about it is shown on the Vengeance DVD if you have it watch the extras If not you could possibly buy it but if not you really need to trust me on this one Like you I want my work to be read and enjoyed so we must come to an agreement on this one 

Got any other ideas
