Look at this whole talk page We cant even talk about the article without emphasising if we are for or against it No you cant claim that there is only procirc pollution in there There is anticirc pollution in there also Unfortunately the people writing up this article are focusing too much on negative aspects on this They obviously never went to freewebscomprocirc   or circinfocom  or cirlcistcom These all show a pro side I think that the majority want to put negatives in We have have to put pros and negatives You guys need to stop arguing The only reason why this is under so much heat is because it pertains to the male penis which is very important to men
