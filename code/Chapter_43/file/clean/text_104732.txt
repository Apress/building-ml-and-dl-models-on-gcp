You are Wrong 

Hello

I can only assume that Wikipedia are NOT interested in HISTORY In ENGLAND we are

The site and the external links that you have taken upon yourself to remove are NOT commercial in any way they tell the story of a famous business and their premises that CLOSED down back in the early 1980s  

For your information our local Council the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral have requested and are in the process of putting all the original documentation regarding the contents of this web site into their safe achieves at the Boroughs Town Hall Its a shame Wikipedia want to hide all this from the World
