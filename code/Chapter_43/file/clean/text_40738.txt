Which is which and what is what 

To someone who is not familiar with grammar terminology the main first section does not make it clear which of the examples are objective and which are subjective Also some indication as to what target and initiator are would be helpful To describe things by associating them with other grammatical terminology alone just leads people in a circle of strange new words and explains very little to those who might actually need to seek help in understanding grammatical terms by referring to a free online encyclopedia It would be nice if someone could make this clearer and more accessible to the uninitiated Thanks
