Traditional Chinese Characters not needed 
My concern is that because Macau and HK are parts of China we should add traditional characters as well According to this kind of thought then shouldnt we add Uyghur Korean Tibetan and Mongolian as well because they are parts of China too Unless there are Simplified Chinese characters on the Republic of China article page as well because the Kuomintang still claims mainland China and even Mongolia as part of the ROC there is no need for traditional characters
