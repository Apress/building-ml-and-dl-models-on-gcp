It would be really great if you kept any comments on the talk page especialy those regarding questionable copyright or sources lacking attached to the texts  For example TalkMuhammeds last sermon  Fair warning anything that I have questioned on this end is guarnteed to be immediately put up for deletion over at Wikisource  If the orginal contributor over here has not clarified in all this time the chances of them doing so over at Wikisource are slim to none  And hunting down translators without any clues where it came from is near impossible  Thanks for all the hard work you are doing getting these moved over Êˆ Talk
