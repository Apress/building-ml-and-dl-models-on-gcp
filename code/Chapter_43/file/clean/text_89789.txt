I removed the second sentence of this article Syria is often seen to be in support of terrorism and terrorist groups in the Middle East Because of NPOV concerns Yes this is an issue with Syria  but in its current location it gives the impression this is the primary item of interest concerning Syria Other countries accused of harboring terrorism  Libya North Korea Iran  do not have a statement in such a prominent position   1740 21 Feb 2004 UTC
