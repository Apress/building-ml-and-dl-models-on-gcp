Why cant Russians move their brain once and just acknowledge that homosexuality is a natural trait and it cannot be learned You cant learn to have blue eyes duh For young people who are gay and feel alone because of their identity it is dreadful to isolate them even more and make them feel just as if they were the only gay people in the world Often that loneliness and exclusion causes people to end their life but Russia knows something about it judging how high the suicide rate is in that backward European country
