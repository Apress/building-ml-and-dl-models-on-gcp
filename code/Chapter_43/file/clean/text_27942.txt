Christophe I have reversed your edits because they are unjustified  I have justified all of my statement with reference to multiple sources  I am prepared to push on this matter until it goes to arbitration Structure Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences presents all of the core ideas of deconstruction and that was presented in 1966 OG was published one year later  The most important influence oon Derridas work is Heidegger and I have provided cistations for that and can provide more if needed Lacans influence on deconstruction is minor  The term deconstruction is derived from Heideggers destruktion  Again I can substantiate all of my claims with sources you have none  You cant use your interpretation of a text as a source
