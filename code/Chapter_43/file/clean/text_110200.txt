The name is to be blunt nonsensical No actual 10string guitarist or authority on this instrument uses this terminology which is entirely s own creation Why the anachronistic classical Neither the 10stringed harpguitar of the 19th century nor the modern 10string guitar is an instrument from the Classical period and an acoustic guitar is as little limited to the performance of socalled Classical music as an acoustic piano is And what exactly is meant by extendedrange Extended from what This is assuming that the guitar had a fixed range which is a fallacy considering most of the notable guitarists of the 19th century Sor Carulli Coste Mertz Legnani Manjon etc also wrote forperformed on guitars with more than 6 strings many of which had a treble range that was extended beyond the 19th20th fret that is the norm on todays guitars All in all this is a nonsensical title for an article that should simply be called tenstring guitar that that should include only historically significant instruments ie not things like the Marlow 10string guitar And there should be a separate article for the Yepes 10string guitar which this article currently simply continues to confuse with unrelated developements that have nothing to do with the primary defining characteristic of the Yepes instrument its singualr tuning which uniquely gives sympathetic string resonance in unison with any note fretted on the treble strings
