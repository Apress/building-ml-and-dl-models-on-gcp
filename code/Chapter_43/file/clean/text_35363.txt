Names 

With regard to Nibhurrereya the reconstructed form of this name would probably be along the lines of nibxuperwəˡreʕə Ancient Egyptian A Linguistic Introduction Loprieno 1995  This reconstruction reflects the neutralization of posttonic vowels and the change ˡi  ˡe which Loprieno indicates occurred early in the new kingdom

While Im at it Id like to call for the following change to be made slightly modified from my previous appeal

The article gives a reconstruction of his name as tuwtʕankhjaman However the Coptic descendent of twt image is ⲧⲟⲩⲱⲧ indicating that  would have been pronounced something like tVˡwat Ancient Egyptian A Linguistic Introduction Loprieno 1995 Die Nominalbildung Des Aegyptischen Osing 1976 where V is an undetermined vowel one of e a or u in Tuts time Likewise nx living here is an active participle probably perfective so the reconstruction of this should be ʕanəx including the effect of posttonic vowel neutralization Loprieno 1995 As for jaman Loprieno indicates that the change j  ʔ before an unstressed vowel began in the early Middle Kingdom This suggests that jaman was realized as ʔaman by the time of Tutankhamun  I therefore propose the reconstruction of his name be changed from tuwtʕankhjaman to tVwatʕanəxʔaˡman where V is a vowel of undetermined quality  I have no idea where tuwt and ʕankh came from  These just look like modified Egyptologistese to me   192133846
