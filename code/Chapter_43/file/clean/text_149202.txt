Regarding the Speedy Deletion of my entry for The Resonance Project

I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper talk process  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Harameins lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed  Either way its flatearth society type behaviour that I find objectionable

I understand your points but disagree particularly on the notability aspect  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called community  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it and by doing so silenced my opinions  Thats wrong  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the Speedy Deletion I could find no such option

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas then you have a problem  Wikipedia you have a problem and if I cant get entries for Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia the notsofree encyclopedia Wake up  Wikipedia editorsopen your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world not another puppet

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics whatever you want to call it is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not  There are thriving social media communities of 300000 individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harrameins Facebook pages and yet Wikipedia via its ignorant sorry its true editors quickly dismiss as not notable  Its notable enough for 300000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds who are you to dismiss so many peoples opinions  300000 people think about that

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones
