The term is not controversial in North America either However there is a tiny number of political activists who want to attach a stigma or victim status to the world oriental and thereby justify their pandering and prostituting for political gain They exploit the ignorance of some and the compassion of others to exploit the American political system This doesnt actually solve any problems but it does generate a flow of government dollars to their cause
