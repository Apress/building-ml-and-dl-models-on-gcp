You can claim whatever you like and assume bad faith as much as you like The fact of the matter is that both claims you make and insist on returning to the article are unsourced You could be right but you provide no evidence It is normal Wiki practice that unsourced statement can be removed at any time Im being patient When people challenge statements I make I dont return them until I have sources As it stands then you are insisting on having your personal ideas stand in the text despite a lack of evidence that anyone but yourself holds them Please prove that those opinions are the opinions of a source and not your own
