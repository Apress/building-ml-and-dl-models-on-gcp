Pareto Efficiency and Optimality
This page is messed up
 While there is a relationship between Pareto Optimality and Pareto Efficiency
 they are different results  I use Pareto optimality in my consulting see also
Wiederhold Gio What is Your Software Worth Communications of the ACM Vol49 No9 Sept2006 p6575
Some statements under P Efficiency belong under optimality as most of the first paragraph  
Pareto Optimality deserves its own page But now it redirects and I dont know how to change that
