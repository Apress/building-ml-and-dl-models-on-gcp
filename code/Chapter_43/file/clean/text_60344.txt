I posted this communication for user Phil_Boswell as hereafter set out

Your treatment of me was horribly unfair unjust and contradicted all principles of fair dealing You have failed to adhere to the principles of Natural Justice in particular the principle audi alteram partem

My reasonable comments manifestly factual and fair for which I was preventented by you from providing further justification and explanation were attacked by you without any or any reasonable explanation

Please provide me with all relevant details so that a full and fair hearing of your actions can be adjudicated forthwith and without delay talk

I am new to Wikipedia and I dont know what steps to take to

1 Redress the injustice complained of and

2 Deal with the ugly problem of antisemitism that I understand to include Christian chauvanism 

חג שםח וחג שמחת תורה
