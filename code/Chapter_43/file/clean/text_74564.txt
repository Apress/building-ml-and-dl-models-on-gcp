Suggestion CategoryVictims of the September 11 2001 attacks 

Im really hesitant about bringing this up once more so I apologize in advance if this suggestion offends anyonebut wouldnt it make sense to replace the individual victim names with a single pointer to CategoryVictims of the September 11 2001 attacks  There are only a dozen individual entries at the moment but if the precedent is that the victims of 911 should be listed individually dozens or hundreds of entries on this page will become untenable  Again please take no offense at this suggestion its in the interests of practicality not to diminish any of these individuals
