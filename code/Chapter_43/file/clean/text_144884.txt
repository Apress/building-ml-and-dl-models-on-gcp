Reporting the News 

I have added a few sentences to section on news reporting on the Final Solution in the US based on the NY Times 150th anniversary acknowlegement that they purposefully minimized and obfuscated the news and the work of Laurel Leff and Deborah Lipstadt  i have linked to another wiki article The New York Times and the Holocaust  That page is under severe attack by a couple of people who think this is not a mainstream topic and keeps being gutted so link at any time is not to the full article  cimicifugia
