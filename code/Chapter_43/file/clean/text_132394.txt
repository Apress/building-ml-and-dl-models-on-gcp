Its antiIsrael to now think its ok for them to have a free range and do what ever they want against other peoples Just so you know Hamas is the elected goverment in Gaza And for everyone who considers Hamas a terrorist organisation it shouldnt come as a surprise if they preform acts of terror but when a free democratic country sinks to that same level while still trying to hold on to the moral high ground everyone wont stand for it If any other country in the world bombed a school filled with refugee families killing the same number civilians it would cause an out cry So its not antiIsrael its antihypocrisy and antikilling human beings  dler
