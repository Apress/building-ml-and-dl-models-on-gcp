Why did Saturn fail 

I came to this entry to find out why GM is having to close Saturn  obviously decreasing sales  but why did this occur  I would have thought that a new car company  away from the strangling management and unions of GM started from scratch to compete against foreign small cars would have been a winner  after all the problem with GMDetroit right now is that they dont make the right kind of cars dont make small cars to compete with foreign small cars  But this article tells me      absolutely nothing about what went wrong at Saturn  Another useless Wikipedia entry  I guess Ill have to go someplace else to find out what happened to Saturn  PSMore and more entries at Wikipedia are becoming like this ie leaves out tons of pertinent information can NEVER have negative information in a Wikipedia entry  that is VERBOTIM until the article is useless  Preceding unsigned comment added by 8115854161
