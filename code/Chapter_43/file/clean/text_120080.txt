Her popularity is partisanbased Shes popular to conservative white Americans but unpopular to hated among AsianAmericans not to mention the Philippines itself I remain unconvinced as to why you think that makes her the best person to represent FilipinoAmericans

Aside from being an oddly specific notability requirement being on the NYT bestseller list the longest doesnt erase the fact that her work has nothing to do with FilipinoAmericans She complains about being the target of racism but actively criticizes AsianAmericans to the point that she herself has been called racist She is relevant in an article on conservatism perhaps But here her relevance is eclipsed by people who have actually been part of the Filipino or AsianAmerican identity  and have no negative or controversial reputations with regards to the subject matter

Anyway Ive lost interest in this discussion This is pointless so do what you will really  I have a feeling that if I had tried to replace someone else there wouldnt be this much opposition shrugÂ SOUL
