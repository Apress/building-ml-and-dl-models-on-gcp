Assyrian culture 

I feel that the article is absolute garbage I recently did an edit on Assyrian peoplefuture page in the culture section that sounds a lot better I would like to hear what you think should be done in regards to the subsections Do you think I should take the bulk of that section and replace the actual article Ive done a lot with the future page I would appreciate some help from someone Chaldean wrote the section on language and I revised it a bit but other than that I havent had too much help Could you assist or gather a group of people like you did with that miniproject a while ago Id appreciate it
