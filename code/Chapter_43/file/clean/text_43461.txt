Admin Abuser Barek 

A wikipedia administrator named BarekhttpenwikipediaorgwikiUserBarek kept banning me from wikipedia without warning or reason I changed the the page armour to american english and it got reverted I changed it once more and received a warning for doing so I stopped immediately after but still got banned for a day with a warning on my page I blanked my page after the ban as the warning was redundant Barek reverted the edits so I blanked the page once more Then he proceeded to ban me again without a single warning Ive been banned 3 times by him so far and every time without a  warning or reason WPBLANKING clearly states its only against the rules to delete sanctions that are in affect I just dont want to continue using a website with poor administrators I hope something can be done about this Thanks
