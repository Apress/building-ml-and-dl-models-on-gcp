Horse articles 
I agree that the use of Footnotes or simply Notes Citations and References is perfectly acceptable However there is no consistency in the way these terms are used and on quite a few of the FA articles the term Footnotes is used in place of Citations or References and on at least two articles the notes were labelled Notes and the citations were labelled Footnotes There appears to be some misunderstanding as to when and where the terms Notes andor Footnotes ought to be used If Citations is the preferred heading for inline references then you need to take this up with others who write about horses My point here is specifically to eliminate the wrong usage of the term Footnotes for sections that do not contain anything that even vaguely resembles a footnote 

Since consistency appeared to be an issue I changed a number of articles simply to make them consistent They have been changed back and unless someone has subsequently corrected them are no longer consistent
