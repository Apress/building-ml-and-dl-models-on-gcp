Stick to topic 

I would suggest cleaning up the article so it contains relevant information Example there is no reason to mention the crusades which occurred thousands of years later in an article about the pyramids of Egypt Its convoluted information like this whos only function is to steer off topic at best or discredit Wikipedia as a legitimate source at worst
