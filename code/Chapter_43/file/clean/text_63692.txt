Bad faith deletion of new article on Shefa 
Eliezer under a new name is trying to delete articles on real organizations  The claim he made on the Shefa Network page is false and disingenuous The Shefa Network is a real group within Conservative Judaism and in fact is already larger than many organizations that Wikipedia already has many articles on

The Shefa Network already has several hundred members they have their own journal their own website they have already had two major conferences and two more conferences are planned soon Yet Eliezer and a friend of his are trying to delete its article  Eliezer has refused to even discuss the issue on the articles discussion page despite the fact that I am trying to engage in civil discourse  Eliezer and his friend havent even tried to see if the group exists

Note the timestamps they tried to delete the article within minutes of its creation  They obviously didnt even try to read the groups official website or read its academic journal  They certainly never went to any of Shefas conferences  They also never joined Shefas email list and asked anyone about the group Look attempting to delete a page without even trying to ascertain the facts is clearly against Wikipedia policy  And doing so while refusing to engage in dialogue is editing in bad faith by definition

If someone somehow still doubts that this organization exists I can arrange for an interview with its founder or its journal editor webmaster and members of this organization who have been to Shefas academic conferences
