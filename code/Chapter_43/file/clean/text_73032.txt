The Catholic Church example is a good one but Id like to point out several key distinctions First off its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church this is not the case for the NRA We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities so the Lead needs to reflect that Second with all of the various controversy involving the Church none of it mentioned until the last paragraph Third its Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has I would be fine with something similar The National Rifle Association of America NRA is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members But quite frankly that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative

Furthermore if we take a clinical look at what they do today its a variety of things that range from publishing and multimedia television internet etc to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes gun control gun rights or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence At the very least I dont see why the first sentence cant just be generically descriptive Maybe something like The National Rifle Association of America NRA is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals In the 21st century it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington DC as well as a large multititle magazine publisher an advocate for hunters outdoorsmen and the  and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the US

That said I will try to find other examples but given this list Category501c3 nonprofit organizations it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like Ive described By the way Im advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WPLead not just the 1st sentence I think that Policy is fairly clear but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editors need to quote the WPLead page a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a nonspecialist will understand This is something beyond what a magazine subscription or occasional mailing will provide  Talk áƒ¦
