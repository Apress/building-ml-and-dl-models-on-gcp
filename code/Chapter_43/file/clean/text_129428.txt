Adding HII info for the table 

Im wondering if particularly in this season if it makes sense to add in the HII holders as of entering tribal council to the best we know about in the weekbyweek summary table using one extra column after Immunity and then adding a symbol like  to indicate if it is used  Obviously until this season knowing where the HIIs were was not hard to figure but now that were getting HII action this might make sense to add  I would then also add them back to past seasons where relevant
