New project for me
Originally I was going to write about Chicago mass transit because of a red link but I found out that theres already a good article on it by a slightly different name  Thanks for the link

I am going to write about Newton Minow who has quite an interesting background  He is in Chicago  Hes the Honorary Counsel General of Singapore to Chicago has quite a law background and headed the Federal Communications Commission at one time where he coined the term vast wasteland for TV  Nothing for you to do but its my foray into Chicago related topics
