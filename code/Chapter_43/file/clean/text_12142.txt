Nice edits capitalized book titles
Very nice edits Fred The bit on Jesper is lovely now I only have a problem with the anatomical system where mental attributes correspond to body parts such as worrying to the stomach I dont understand it and the syntax kind of collapses Btw I capitalized the main words in all your book titles which is the primary recommendation in the Manual of Style but I have some doubts now Ive slept on it Your system was consistent and perfectly good in itself do reinstate it if you prefer it maybe it looks better The MoS explicitly accepts all academic styles its specific recommendations are more meant to help people who arent familiar with any style  Talk 0956 1 Feb 2005 UTC
