Special Task Force
Hey there
Would you mind stepping in on the article Special Task Force
I am taking a more proactive role in the improvement of United Nations related articles as well as planning to create a WikiProject dedicated to Human Rights and Aids Groups which means I dont want to get bogged down fighting over trivial things however I do not like the idea of referanced material that I have put into Wikipedia being slowly eroded away 
Thankyou
 

 Sure Ill take a look into it   

 As you might already have seen your edits were promptly reverted by another user so as to avoid 3RR I probably will open an Arb on this not because that paragraph is particularly significant but because it is important to put such behavior as deleting referancedcited infomation and using various users in cabal to surplant Wikipedia policy Please inform me on my talk page if you would like to be included in such an arb case I completely understand if you do not as it is a long often infuriatingly long process  
 I think this conflict worked out well  the article got a whole new section
