Talked to Merrill once about 1965 or 66 I was trying to get him to speak to my CAP squadron Too busy

One reason I mentioned him was that he had done a transAtlantic round trip in a L10E shortly before AE started her final trip They met in MIA and exchanged note

He was a local celebrity having been chief pilot for EAL

Have a nice one
