 Codes and minor state 

Please stop Since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there Is Algeria minor Iran Its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted As for making MA a country code for Western Sahara its not MA is a code for Morocco and so it is in Moroccos infobox EH was created for Western Sahara so that is its country code As far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places TCM 
It does not need a definition to be in the article A minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council  etc As to the EH domain it clearly states the eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned MA being the one used in the territory The same thing applies for the currency the MAD is the currency of Morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory The same thing goes for the IAC 212 the Time zone 0 UTC etc They are the ones used in the territory These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in 1979 of the AlgerianCuban drafted document that has no obligation on the UN The ZionismRacism example is the brightest one for you to understand it I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess  
It does Since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense What states that ma is being used in the territory Do you have any evidence of this at all The same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards Western Sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states Im not going through this with you again TCM 
 Ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities Minor states is indeed a value judgement  although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se But in the interest of neutrality merely noting African Asian and Latin American states seems reasonable At the same time if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied Same standards on language   
 Evidence on ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using ma It is trivially easy to find that Koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding   
What is an example of a website with an ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara  D Trebbien talk 2340 2008 May 5 UTC
 Good question Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory exWS provinces largely in the CasaRabat area Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune httpwwwlaayouneinvestmafrindexasp may have its server physically in Laayoune Other similar offices may also It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the Moroccan address ma Polisario partisans may not like that but its effective reality   
Country codes I find it reasonable th
