 Norristown PA 

Someone went to a lot of trouble to explain the situation in Norristown For years Ive seen Numbers games mentioned in mob movies but never understood This explains it well Thx It seems like this person had firsthand experience with the people in this racket Has anyone written a newspaper article or book that could be used as a more traditional source
