First I didnt realize the IOC had separate publications for each language
On that note I noticed in the 2000 rankings that both Chinese Taipei TPE and Morocco MAR are ranked 58th overall  However instead of following the IOC code it seems to be going by English spelling thus Chinese Taipei is listed before Morocco
I think there needs to be more investigation and discussion to resolve this matter
