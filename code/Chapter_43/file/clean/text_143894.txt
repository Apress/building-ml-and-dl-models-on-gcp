All the links from this page seem to have been deleted I have postd my dream dictionary I do beleive that posting links is valid How else is such information to be conveyed I have spent years analysing dreams Its not a science Yet I have attempted to backwards engineer dreams Look at important events that could trigger dreams Then see how the dream symbols relate to reality Hey I maybe spamming But other than posting up an entire dream dictionary how is such information to be conveyed Really I thought this was a half decent sitye Now I just see certain people enforce their own ideas There is really no democracy
For your interest this is my site

Dream symbols

That link to httpdmozorg is useless Its just a dream directory Its imposible to joing it because the peopkle who run the sitys have long since lost interest Just dump it Its worthless
