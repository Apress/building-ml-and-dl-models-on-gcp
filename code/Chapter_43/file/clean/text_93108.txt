OK according to  Prosthy Plus includes the stories of In the Jaws of Danger 1967 and Getting Through University 1968 In the Jaws of Danger was supposedly published in Worlds of If as I mentioned above but according to Amazons online reader robotoid is on pages 111 132 134 along with Metallica and 139  confirms that robotoid appeared in at least Getting Through University Robotsixtyeight per cent The robotoid took the news impassively but this is from the 1985 TOR publishing of the book as Anthonology so I dont know if it also appeared in the original 1968 publishing it probably did but its not definite in my mind yet Regardless its becoming more obvious Beter wasnt the first to use robotoid However its possible he never heard of it before 1979 assuming he wasnt into scifi or ever saw Lost in Space assuming robotoid was ever used on it as I describe above
