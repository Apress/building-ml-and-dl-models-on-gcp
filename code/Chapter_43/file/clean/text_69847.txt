Another Policy 
moved from personal talk page
There is also another policy here its called consensus which holds precedence over being bold the latter of which is a guideline and thus not canonical Consensus for this article is to not refer to badvista and discuss any such changes before making it live I already said the discussions in this effect can be found in talk pages 

Btw I am preserving the original state of the article nor making them without discussion Propose your concerns and let others comment This is how such articles are handled Each party has to accept the majority decision

Btw you are not supposed to edit archive pages  Comments should go to the talk page And removing comments from user talk pages without a pointer to where it is also frowned on Btw sorry for coming of as bitey that wasnt my intention

 I havent removed any comment from this page If I dont edit the page how can I add new comments  

I suggest again you propose the changes in the talk page and let others respond My comments are already there The ball now lies with the community and not either you or me   talk 
Sorry didnt notice you already did  talk 

I find it very confusing as I read more

 keep saying we need to propose changes in the talk page before we can edit it However first I saw you dont discuss before you revert changes Second I found that you didnt discuss every time before you edit pages or add new contents by viewing your own edit history so it appears you are asking someone to follow some rules which you dont follow either You are setting a bad example since you are an admin After all no page saying we have to discuss pages before we can edit Please point it out if Im wrong since I have no time reading all minor policies and rules in Wikipeida 

If  is right about what it says I could say Wikipedia gives you a false impression that anyone can contribute the article freely as long as you are acting in good faith Try to read WPbold or Wikipedia does not have firm rules The reality clearly tells you the other way round

WikipediaIgnore_all_rules states that it is an official policy It reads

Then could anyone try me why I received a serious warning from  said you must follow this and that or you will be banned I dont think I have violated any major policy or I am deserved to be banned eg vandalism Is it enough to issue a ban simply because you dont know BadVistaorg is a bad source as the admin claims

This further proves the socalled official policy above is nonexistent From the sound of it the admin has been closing all room for argument once it is decided It doesnt really allow you to ignore a rule in reality no matter how sound you are Lets say I think we should present all popular claims  BadVistaorg is one of them because we shouldnt filter on behalf of the readers We should present both sides of the arguments and let the readers should judge by themselves Of course I cant choose to ignore even if the official policy grant me to do so Admin is always above the policy

On 14 Oct 2007 the page was locked up because I made some bad edit according to what  said I assume a lock up is not a decision made so lightly As a matter of fact I couldnt edit it anymore

In reality the admin essentially  controlled everything Although there are official policies in place I seriously doubt whether admins will obey it As a matter of fact he once reverted all my contributions Of course he offered no reasons when he first did it clearly against the revert policy which said you should explain to the contributor before you revert 

cquoteAct in good faith and assume good faith on the part of ot
