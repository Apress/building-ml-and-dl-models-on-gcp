No but they were quite clear that price and value were separate things  Hence the endless misnomer surrounding antiques and paintings in these sorts of debates  someone can pay any price for anything  theres no discernable law which will necessarilly explain all prices but values can  I suppsoe the main debate is whetehr value determines or overdetermines price
