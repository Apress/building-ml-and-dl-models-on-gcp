There are still numerous errors and omissions in the article I have just noticed that the article is claiming that The house was closed as a crime scene from 2 November 2007 until April 2009 Technically true perhaps but omitting the undocumented entries by police and the burglaries of the cottage during that period On the other hand the article now seems to be claiming that the death of the victim occurred before 11 pm giving Knox and Sollecito a cast iron alibi I suppose that since these errors are not really favouring one particular side I dont see any reason to oppose removing the NPOV tag Ill support its removal as long as the article becomes more accurate
