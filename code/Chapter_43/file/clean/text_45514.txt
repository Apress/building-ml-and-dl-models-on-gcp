Speaking for myself only it may be the case that the version I and others keep reverting too could be edited down while still making the same points  However Skepti your attempts to date have gone way too far to the other side and as such have little chance of leading to a stable resolution  Please try to find a solution that introduces the material you want to introduce without completely gutting the wellsourced arguments that you either dont like or feel are somehow misrepresented here  I am confident that we can all find a happy solution to this nowtedious debate but please recognize that it is you who came to change what already existed so it is natural that other editors will be looking more in your direction to forge an acceptable compromise
