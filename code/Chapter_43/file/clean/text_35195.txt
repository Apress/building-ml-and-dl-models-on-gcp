Im afraid I will not be restoring your other comment I am familiar with WPTALK of course  as Im sure you are familiar with WPBLANKING Before you made that comment I specifically asked you not to leave further messages on my talkpage unless you were willing to adopt a more collegiate attitude Your subsequent comment betrayed no change in stance So I removed it and I stand by that removal per policy and per my own sense of right and wrongI appreciate your offer to unblock me and hope that you will consider doing so in recognition of the fact that the offending passage is now removed and that I would have done so on request at any time However I am resolute that the deleted comment is going to remain deleted Taginspectorate
