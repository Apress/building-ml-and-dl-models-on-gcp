You dont have to go through the trouble but thanks  Ive been the ward finance clerk off and on for years so I know no donations at that level go to Scouts plus I shell out personally to Friends of Scouting  I think its me not understanding the sources of income for the Boy Scouts of America and similar international organizations  Since Im the CFO for a nonprofit I will look that up on my own  I was just unclear on what support represents  But I do appreciate your help
