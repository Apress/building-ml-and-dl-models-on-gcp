Strange I agree with livelikemusic and think years should be added for recurring characters If they were to quit the show we would move them to the prior cast members section and any years they were recurring would be mentioned there right I was going to add Eileen Davidsons previous characters to her section as is done with Kristian Alfonso and Galen Gering and has been discussed and agreed should be done for actors who have portrayed multiple characters but dont want to as it is because it would just be too confusing without dates
