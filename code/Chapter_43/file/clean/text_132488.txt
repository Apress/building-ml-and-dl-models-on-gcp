There is no link to Disability Alert in Premier Binns article Theres a link to Disability rights in Prince Edward Island but thats a legitimate topic altogether separate from his blog I assume that when the province was founded in 1873 there was at least one person with some form of a disability and so from then on to 2006 or whenever the topic is unrelated to Mr Pates unorthodox measures

 Ive removed the see also link but the words to Islanders with disabilities now point to this article

 Yes I do realise that its all a oneman operation Ive repeatedly questioned him on the topic with no response otherwise

 Regarding tuition taxes equalisation etc yes I agree the article is sorely lacking without this content which clearly has been of importance to the province over his terms in office I invite you to add it to the article and link to news coverage of these advances so people can read about them in further depth

 Nothing has ever stopped you or anyone else from adding this content to the article All we ask is that everything is properly referenced and contains no POV
