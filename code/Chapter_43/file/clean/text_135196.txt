I cant edit with people like MickMacNee running riot  its just lawless Some newperiphery admin need time awat from my comments to think too  they clearly have never really understood the problems surrouding Ireland and they are not that easy to get hold of  as in as stupidly obvious as they think they are They have the rudeness and sheer NGF to talk to people like they are doh not getting the doh obvious What goes on in these peoples heads Im tired of being adressed as a POVpusher or remedial in some way It should be fucking obvious there has been a serious problem here let alone the gory details Ill be back in a week when the dust has settled and Ill have at look what is around If a bot has been set loose I cant see myself being interested somehow
