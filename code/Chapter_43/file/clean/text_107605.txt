Poor translation for The Boss 

Voyevoda Woman Warrior that is poor translation either in the game or in the article dunno what the game says on this Voyevoda means War Leader or Warchief and in no way shape or form does it imply anything about a Woman A note should probably be made to clear it up as its either a poor traslation from Japaneese into Russian and subsequently English in the game or a mistake in wiki article
