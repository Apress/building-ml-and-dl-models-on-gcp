Please do not accuse members of vandalism I do not mind if you change the word unique to prominent or remove stories of dreams etc but you have vandalised the page and made a statement biased by saying that Dr Qadri only sent out a referendum so I reverted the whole edit You have also reciently vandalised the page by removing the names of the Yemeni scholars who recieved Dr Qadris Ijaza including the pictures and this is a clear form of vandalism so before accusing other members of vandalism do not vandalise the page yourself What I did was clearly not vandalism as I only reverted your edit and any changes you made and brought the page back to its previous form So would you first kindly read the rules of wikipedia and find out the definition of vandalism before accusing experienced users You are still new to wikipedia Im afraid and you need to learn how it works and the different rules of wikipedia before making any further edits
