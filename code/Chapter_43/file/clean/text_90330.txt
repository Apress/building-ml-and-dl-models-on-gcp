Thank you for checking Ive asked another editor who has more experience dealing with NFCC about this Id imagine that the source links for other files have died over the years so perhaps some kind of precedent has been established It might be a good idea to download the image and keep it for safe keep just in case That way if by chance it does end up being deleted it can be recreated if the source is eventually found Another idea is to try and find out why it was removed from Northcliffe Media and figure out if it can be readded I was able to find something which looks like a logo on an archived page but it is quite different from the one you uploaded and Im not sure if 1 it was even used and 2 if it is OK to use an archived page for the source I was also able to find this old page but still no logo
