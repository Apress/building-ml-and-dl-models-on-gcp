Hungarian names for places before 1867 
Hi as the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary was Latin until 1867  using Hungarian names for cities etc before this date is anachronistic Since the Latin name that was used at the time can scarcely be found we should list all the places with their modern names Thank You
