Fair enough mistakes happen no problem 
I am attempting to move this discussion to the talk page for the article in question however I will respond to the specific issues you seem to be having here
You seem to be mincing terms view such fonts as Unicode  reality is actually closer to the reverse of this statement and understandably confusing very different subjects characters glyphs fonts I will try my best to addressexplain what I assume to be the underlying issues rather than just the symptoms

The change I made to the article was nothing to do with fonts that was only apparent to you specifically the character exsited and was likely downloaded sucessfully but the font in use didnt have a glyph to display it  the solution is simple use a better font if you wish to see the glyph for the character All I did was use the correct character further discussion on the article talk page once I finish typing it

Unicode is the standard character encoding these days all others are now considered legacy USASCII and ISO 88591 can both be treatedprocessed as UTF8 a character encoding for Unicode Notable operating systems and major applications in their entirity now use Unicode as their character encoding of choice addingallowing backwardscompatibility where needed at least in good quality productspackages This includes the majority of Microsoft products
UXXXX numbers are Unicode code points an easy way to referrence specific characters without ambiguity and need not concern the average person browsing the web
Wikipedia pages are sent to you as UTF8 Unicode so youre viewing them as Unicode anyway
Fonts for USASCIIISO 88591 are interchangable in modern operating systems The software with which youre viewing this page is very likely written using Unicode character encoding operating system  web browser

Part of the reason for using the actual character natively in headings on talk pages at least was so that others could easily determine if their default systembrowser configuration supported a more suitable range of characters in order to be able to provide feedback about said character Its not like a missing glyph is causing an application failure in which case I could understand your concerns

Your claim that My point is  about everybody else who cant see the font correctly is seemingly baseless Where is your evidence that anyone beyond yourself is having trouble seeing the glyph for this character What about the people for whom the use of correct characters will help those using speechsynthisis software If you can provide citationevidence for this rather wild claim Id like to read it otherwise I cant help but feel youre merely expressing your own wishespreferrencesdesires dispite the other issues What beyond the issues youve encountered personally are the reasons behind your disagreement with my changes It seems that perhaps these articles are a little too close to your heart based on the nature and speed of your responsees to the change

Article names here should be as simple as possible emphasis mine
No article names should be as clear as possible or as simple to comprehendunderstand as possible or provide for simplest readability I suggest it may be worthwhile to read about the subject of usability which is the dicipline concerned with making things easy to use
Taking your argument further should punctuation be removed too as that would make titles much simpler although less clear Removing punctuation would mitigate the need to use percentencoding in URLs making MediaWiki itself simpler although less flexible I realise my example is counterintuitive but it was to emphasise the point that clarity above all else is actually whats important not simplicity A parallel example is userinterfaces the most usable are not those which are simplest but those which display the right information at the right time clarity

Im familiar with how screenreaders functionoperate Not all ride on top of the users browser Blind people are not the only users of speechsynthisis software 
Besides youre confusing the visual rendering of a charater a glyph with the character itself and other representatinosrenderings of it such as audiospeech Modern screenreaders access the sourcecode of the page the browser itself is just a vehicle to get to the desired page andor aquire the sourcecode itself along with the character encoding So theyre given
