Wikid77 Amanda Knox herself stated in her own testimony that she had showered in the bathroom with the bloodstains which also contained the faeces from Guede as she also has said that she thought the bloodstains must have come from one of the female residents of the apartment having their period As for the suggestion that the extensive forensic evidence of cleaning in the apartment is based on the fresh scent of warm soap etc  the police used Luminol to uncover bloodstains and bloody footprints in various parts of the apartment that had been cleaned away and were no longer visible to the naked eye Im sure it is not your intention to spread misinformation about the trial by using this discussion page for that purpose now that the main page has been partially locked but the net effect may be the same if you continue to enter statements in the discussion which are not based on the established facts of the case Please bear in mind that the existence of the bloody footprints that had been cleaned away are not disputed by the defence but the identity of the footprints was disputed Therefore we may fairly presume that at least some parts of the apartment had been cleaned so that blood was no longer visible to the naked eye
