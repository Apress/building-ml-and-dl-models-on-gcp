 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise The opening section discusses the dynasty status of the Patriots but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts However the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time  13715915335  DLOMME 020608

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl a lot of information thats being added and much of it since deleted may be true but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 181 team NOT to win the Super Bowl    Who cares  And believe me Im no Patriots fan theyve been a thorn in my teams side since last seasons playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry not a fan forum  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur   
Actually protection is not something to be taken lightly  Being an admin and even though I am a diehard Pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article while high is not so bad that we havent been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos  talkcontribs 

FAR
Ive nominated the article for Featured Article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere   

 Protection  

This article is starting to get vandilized again If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected I wonder why vandilism is returning to it Get over it people the superbowls over  
So you want me to request semiprotection  communicatorkills 

 Bias 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned the opposing team and score are given  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teamsscores not given but it doesnt even say that they won them  ie Under Belichick the team went to three Super Bowls in four years  It should be consistant one way or the other

The sentence The Patriots however were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word howev
