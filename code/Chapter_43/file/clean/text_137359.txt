Wikipedia does not do anything  We dodoes not do anything  Wikipedia is meant for input by EVERYONE including those who actually you know have knowledge about the subject at hand  In fact Wikipedia DOES have polls and it is true that polls are not actually needed since merely asking literally any American who lives in America and has commonly interacted with multiple races will get the answer of what is truthful  However since a couple of people are incorrectly insisting on publishing the article using extremely incorrect information one of the polls that Wikipedia does do would be a way to vitally inform those people that yes in fact living in America DOES tell you what people use words for in America  There was no material removed from any article since that would be physically impossible since this is both the Internet which has no physical manifestation as well as an article which is written using words and therefore also has no physical items or textiles involved  In an article about a plant which has a section describing the plants usuage it would of course be grossly improper to then instigate a debate about whether or not that usuage is scientific by writing a sentence which states whether or not such usuage is considered to work by one person or society or research paper or another  The appropriate and valid scope of such an article would be things regarding the plant including how people may use the plant which means that that scope would not include any research or debate on methods of alternative medicine and whether or not they work
