I agree Daniel it is also important to maintain the section in a simple format since it is supposed to be a brief description of Brazilian history  I dont believe we need changes in this section we already have links to more specific articles that will mention the Constitutionalist Revolution or the Encilhamento Regards   
1st Agree with what Paulista If he said nothing of what youre saying He even might say but read what he wrote and see that he did not speak about briefness characteristic
BTW just curious that you have now appeared and even without  disputing any of my denunciations including the unethical use of briefness characteristic as a excuse
