I understand where youre coming from In that case its usage should refer to the source such as according to the FBI followed by a quote from the report in order to keep the article neutral Dont get me wrong Im not a member and agree with the term to describe the group just not the way its written out right now as it currently implies an expression of opinion in the wiki article itself when it was in fact the FBI report that expressed the opinion so they should be directly quoted if it is to be used Ill leave that decision to you
