INTERESTING FACTS 
Unlike hawks falcons and eagles owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus called a crop to store extra food Therefore owls like pygmyowls will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later This is especially important for small highenergy species that must eat frequently

Since pygmyowls are active during daylight they rely on their sense of sight to hunt Consequently this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing silent flight nor exceptional night vision like nocturnal owls
