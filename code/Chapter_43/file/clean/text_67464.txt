I know who I am but who are you 

Funny you should tell me that I came out of nowhere and started reverting everyone Ive checked your last 1000 edits and not even one appears to be a constructive addition Your edit history is pretty much a collection of reversions sometimes just because the editor is blocked in spite of the fact that some of those edits are valid and important for developing WP articles filing SPI reports teaching users about sticking to rules as misinterpreted by yourself as they may be talking down to less experienced users and not being shy about threatening to seek admin help even though this was your first message to the user with whom you never even had the chance to engage in proper discussion and maybe other actions that may have eluded my attention As far as I can tell youre here for the drama I dont even think you really care about article quality Ive asked for a civil reply but you preferred to keep trying to frame me behind my back for no wrongdoing whatsoever If you want to engage in conversation dont hesitate to do so Have a glorious day
