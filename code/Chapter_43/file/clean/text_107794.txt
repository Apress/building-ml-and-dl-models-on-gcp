Yes thats the one  I think Hentschel of Fleet St were just the printers who pioneered the 3colour process in the UK But exactly which of the many 3colour techniques it was Im not sure I suppose it could have been an early form of the modern photographic process with filters When I said above From memory only her first one or two books were printed using wood blocks I might have been thinking of Kate Greenaway A quick look at Bamber Gascoine does not clear up any of this
