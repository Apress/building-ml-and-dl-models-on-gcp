Dear Administrator
 this morning I edited Derrick Bells page and added a link from a NYT article that state that one of his famous essays The Trade Spacers is considered antisemitic by many people  A few hours later the addition was deleted  I posted it again and noticed that another user did the following  
 1914 8 March 2012 HJ Mitchell talk  contribs m   14795 bytes 0   Protected Derrick Bell Violations of the biographies of living persons policy

I found this action abusive as Bell has been dead for months  I proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following
   I find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that Space Traders is considered an antisemitic essay even though there was a link to the original article from NYT where it was discussed and prominent Professors like Dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with peoples philosophy The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school I could understand that But there are articles about his antisemitism Bells page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters views Also Prioryman name calling people you disagree with dunderheads really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots

The user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment but deleted it  I posted the following later
9 March 2012 UTCDear HJ do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT articles about Bells antisemitism as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD I am a simple person the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bells page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views dunderheads I am sorry but ypur behavior as well as priorymans along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers The facts are the facts Is not the Gray Lady a sufficiently legitimate source

Then that user pressed the bell so I will be blocked I may have been naive and thought that senior members in Wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues I was not trying to harass or attack anyone  To the contrary I have been totally respectful of everybody However if the behavior that I encountered today is the typical behavior of the administratorssenior staff then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed As Americans thats one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe  I am really surprised by this whole behavior Is this high school or what We are all adults and we should engage in conversation not call mom when we do not like something My ten year old does this not an adult
