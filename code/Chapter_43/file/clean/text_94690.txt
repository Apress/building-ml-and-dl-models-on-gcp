The problem here brangifer and the thing that as an academic annoys me the most is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do  You are starting from a predefined judgement ie that anything notscience is bad and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position  One can always find someone reputable somewhere who says what one already believes  ufologists do that all the time cherrypicking quotes from scientists and government agencies   but its bad scholarship to do so  You want so desperately to believe that the scientific community agrees with your radically skeptical position that youre grasping at straws  Thats not the way things are done  Ludwigs2
