The paper by dAmecourt was published in 1863 yet Liberatore credits dAmecourt with coining the word some two years earlier I am no longer thinking that La Conqûete de lair par lhélice Exposé dun nouveau système daviation is the holy grail and that the source is some other correspondence of dAmecourts perhaps with one of his contemporaries or some other worthy I still feel that the paper has served as a clue of sorts through Wolfs translation to getting closer to the truth
