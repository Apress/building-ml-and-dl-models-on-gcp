Reassessed later sections need more work to go to B 

 Looks good however going from C to B is a rather big deal As it is now I have serious problems with the sections

 Merchant marine  No sources  no readable prose This needs expansion or alternative needs to be removed altogether Also unclear whether this includes river trade a major Dutch transport sectors

 Pipelines   Again no source and no prose Either expand The dense gas pipelines to almost every home is interesting eg Alternatively remove

 Government  again no sources Additionally this is not completely true as provincial wegen are under provices and local street under municipality So this sections needs considerable expansion

Economics somewhat cryptic Is this about truck transport or also about train goods transport shipping and air cargo Or does it also include the economics of passengers traffic This needs serious expansion and clarification

 With these sections this problematic I am afraid I cannot yet promote to B level
