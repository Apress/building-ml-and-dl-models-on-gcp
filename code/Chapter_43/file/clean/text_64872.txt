First of Kamikaze to be honest this entry has really gone down hill since the last time I left it and it was people like you that put it there Your so called facts you cling too are mearly third party trash much of which is little more than fantasy some of it is such garbage you would have to be an idiot to belive it If you going to rely on documents from third party sites do a little research on the documents like if its a PDF save it and take a look at the publishers marks on the file find out what you can Then look at what a legit document looks like I see legit Walmart Documents And if you find that a fact is a fake is it not your job to get rid of it for the good of the entry As far as the Quebec store I have the proof on my hard drive had you not been so fast to revert I was trying to find a way to post it since its copyrighted But no you couldnt give me a few mins now I cant post it without being banned Now if we are going to bring this entry back to where it should be we need to stop this arguing and back biteing And work for the better that means getting rid of double entrys make it easier to read and understand Now we have to look for real fact not some third party fact thats been messed with An example is the way AFLCIO figures the average walmart workers income they figured 968hr time 40hrweek time 4 weeksmo times 12 That would 1858560yr however is only 48 weeks there is 52 weeksyr isnt there that means they missed a 4 weeks of pay Factor in those weeks and bing wow the pay is 2014040yr thats a differance of 154880yr See what I mean about Twisting FactsThe Ace
