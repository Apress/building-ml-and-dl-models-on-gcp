At the time of my original edits on the page Liberal Party of Australia I was unregistered Since then I have registered as I mentioned on the talk page It was on the TALK page I linked to for people to actually read 

Every time I edited anonymously U didnt realise I had to register to edit they were incorrectly removed by Xtra because they did not match his POV as I have mentioned countless times 

Regardless the data on the wikipedia page is incorrect and every attempt to change it has been thwarted   1046 16 Feb 2005 UTC
