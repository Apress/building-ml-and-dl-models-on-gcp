Pornography 

I removed pornography from examples of hyperreality  Though I certainly understand what the author was thinking not everything considered pornographic by everyones standards is necessarily hyperreal  Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography theres a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument  Lets say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse and lets postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason  Since its a depiction of a sex act and its being distributed this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions  Nothing about it however is inherently hyperreal  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a hyperreal act but that doesnt make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself  This might be an odd example but I think it serves to illustrate that pornography is too vague and subjective a concept to consider inherently hyperreal  But perhaps Im totally wrong
