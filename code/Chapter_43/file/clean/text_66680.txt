No actually were not here for the same reason  I dont have a lot of experience with Wikipedia and Im not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia and I dont read their policies would take too much time  not really interested  Im an armchair readereditor of Wikipedia  What I find with Wikipedia these days is to find out some detailmeat on a subject one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about  I just got through going around in circles with a guy I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter a convicted LuccheseGambino mobster doing life for multiple murders  The whole bio was taken from a wellknown book called Murder Machine and it was referenced at the bottom under References but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didnt have a citation at the end of each sentence  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book and its a good book written by a wellknown NY crime reporter  What the guyadministrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit  that way he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom  I tried putting in a few links but I couldnt get them to work somebody else fixed them  Its really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys they seem to be busybodies as they delete and delete and delete when in fact the items are either 1 well known to anybody that knows the subject matter like Conrads friendship with Spilotro or 2 they are very easily found  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedias syntax etc  You will either not get edits from people like me or if you do they will be deleted  I have no interest in spending the time to become a Wikipedia administrator or Wikipedia edit expert
