You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war Note that the threerevert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24 hour period Additionally users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring even if they do not technically violate the threerevert rule If you continue you may be blocked from editing Please do not repeatedly revert edits but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors If necessary pursue dispute resolution
