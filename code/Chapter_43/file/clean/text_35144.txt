Rarevogel sockpuppet 

Seeing how you blocked Rarevogel I thought I would notify you I noticed the edits of CamTalbot who has   removed Persianate from the Shaybanids article match exactly the same   edit made by Rarevogel CamTalbots edit summary for two of the three times he has removed Persianate has been disingenous     Mongolian Origin was removed The Shaybanids did not have much Mongolian ancestry According to many sources such as Bartold they were mainly of Turkic origin Mongolian part was edited to better inform readers    Removed irrelevant information in order to better inform readers Neither edit summary stating what was really done in the article After a request to take it to the talk page CamTalbot simply removed Persianate again   this time with no edit summary

How many edits are required to prove this is a duck or to file an SPI Rarevogel has been known to use   sockpuppets in the past
