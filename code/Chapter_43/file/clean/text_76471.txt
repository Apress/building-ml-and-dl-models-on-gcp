Oneline summaries are an excellent idea Photos The ones that are already on the respective climbers Wiki page are out of copyright hopefully Ive added some to the List as an example just copy the code and change the image and climber name under R S and T My advice would be to try and vary the sex time period and nationality of whom you choose under each letter this wholly depends of course on what is available under T the only two I could find have you got navigation popups Its a v quick way of seeing whether an article has a photo just hover the mouse over the blue article link and it should pop up were British men with facial hair  Under S I found a more varied selection Ive selected 100px for the size so that we can have a lot of images on the righthand margin Insert them just above the letter name for each letter as I have done for R S and T That way it looks tidy Also try and list them vertically downwards in AZ order Let me know if you have any probs Cheers
