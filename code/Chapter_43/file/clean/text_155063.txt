Please pay attention  You just blanket reverted my changes three times  You did not come to the talk page to discuss your edits rather I had to drag you over here from your talk page and finally my talk page  You have also not explained your reverts in any detail  You seem only interested in edit warring and restoring a poorly written poorly formatted and poorly composed lead section  On Wikipedia we generally try to improve articles not make them worse
