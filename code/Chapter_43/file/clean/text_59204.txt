Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states After giving birth to Christ Mary did have sexual relations and In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children  Certainly some people believe these assertions but they dont belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Churchs Marian dogmas

The article also says that Mary did break her vow by the grace of God  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin  That really needs a citation because Ive never heard anything like it  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life and other people believe she had sex and bore children but as far as I know no one teaches that she had sex but God was okay with it so we call her a virgin anyway  Without a citation this statement should go
