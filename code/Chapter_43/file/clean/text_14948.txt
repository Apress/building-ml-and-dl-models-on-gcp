These four people include WLU Ohnoitsjamie Yankees76 and Quartet These people have been on top of me for no reason except that I edited the Bench Press article to remove their champion and put in the true champion When WLU staed it was vandalism I had to fight tooth and nail to get him to allow it When Yankees76 fought that the reference was not verifiable I won that argument with the assistance of the Guinness Book of World Records and the data provided by organizations recognized by the USOC When I added a bio page for the lifter of note Quartet tried to get it removed but he failed Then when I tried to put a photo up on the site that I own the rights to Ohnoitsjamie ripped it down without any mercy Keep in mind I am a new editors that has been trying to learn this process as I go I have no delusions that my methods are blunt I asked for assistance many times but every chance these four people always made a point to stop me from getting help to get away from them Now Ohnoitsjamie gets to rule on my block It just smacks of a Kangaroo Court Please dont allow this to continue for other editors
