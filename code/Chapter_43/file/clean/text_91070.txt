Im not Greek but have followed the situation since 2011 Also the only time Ive supported ND was the time of its hypocritical opposition to Papandreou government Im generally an opponent of the euro currency and am more inclined to the view of the people who think Greece should reintroduce Drachma and default which would be unavoidable in that case The fact that you did not notice my real POV just underscores the fact that Im for neutrality and verifiability in the articlesSo as weve seen the current claim in the article is wrong Apparently Greece did not meet the criteria for 1999 So the controversy should be treated in the special article Greek Financial Audit 2004 but the way it is worded right now it does not belong to the article at hand
