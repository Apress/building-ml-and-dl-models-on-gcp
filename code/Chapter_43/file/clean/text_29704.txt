Hello 
 About Sartine that is my impression as well and I have left a note in the francophone Wikip√©dia to that effect
 I do very much enjoy these little mysteries but I am a little bit apprehensive at not being able to answer some of your inquiries I suppose that this is inevitable at the granularity level we are reaching but I would much rather have bottomless sources from which to quecnh our thrist
 I have been unable to find anything on Coromandel and none of the number of Modeste seem to match unfortunately On the other hand I am going to put up a little article for Henriette with what I have Cheers
