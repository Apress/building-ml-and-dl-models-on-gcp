A hint of longing a HINT of longing  Its more like an avalanche of teenage angst because your crush wont reciprocate 

a melancholic song about unrequited love especially because its all crescendo and no denouement Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wishmuch less if the person shes confessing her love to actually feels the same way All I Want For Christmas Is You is a onesided confession of wants and desires not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship Honestly the lyrics to me come off as hopelessly sad Williems says  Ive read the critical reception section of the songs Wikipedia page and I cant help but think the critics werent really listening One critic seems to claim there is a hint of longing which might be the understatement of the century

If you wanted to get real bummed about it I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas he continues Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you cant embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song
