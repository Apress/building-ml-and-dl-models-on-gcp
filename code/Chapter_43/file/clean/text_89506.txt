I could do a decade split but I was considering year ones that cover the books in a templated format As over 80 books have been released each year for many years this may be the best option to cover them By decade would still result in blocks of about 800 books and when you add in release ISBN and short summaries they would be still excessively long I was thinking 100 words or so on each book
