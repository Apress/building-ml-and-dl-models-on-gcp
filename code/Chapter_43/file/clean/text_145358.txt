We can easily add Becks POV perhaps quoting the link Im reading now that you added to the talk page but I disagree with your other assertions  In fact I think the article as a whole gives too much credence to the minority viewpoint that Beck is a swell and stable commentator   The introduction for example  is one of the worst Ive read on Wikipedia and it gives absolutely no indication of who this person is and what kind of controversy surrounds him It appears that judging by the talk page comments a small number of editors are enforcing this minority viewpoint on the article through persistence  But I am new to the page as you know and this is just my initial impression so feel free to educate me or otherwise disagree
