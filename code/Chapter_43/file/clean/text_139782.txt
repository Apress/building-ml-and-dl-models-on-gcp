Cheers I saw it in the larp book Playground Worlds and followed the publisher back to the photographer and asked them to release it The photographer very generously agreed and the models did too I like it because it captures some of the excitement of larp in an accessible way and the genre depicted isnt one of the stereotypes fantasy and vampire but is still representative of a lot of larp out there  costumes weapons genre fiction etc Happy that the larp article has a face now
