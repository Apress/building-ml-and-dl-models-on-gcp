httptwittercomCungLe185mediaslideshowurlhttp3A2F2Ftwitpiccom2F6fmuth Directly from his website It would not make sense to represent the USA if he was not a citizen of the USA

I talked to a coworker is not a reliable source Im not sure how Twitter counts but Id assume that if he has his own personal Twitter account that counts as a primary source Barring a reliable secondary source on what citizenship he has primary sources trump I talked to a coworker I believe   One ping only 
 He just tweeted this httpscribetwittercomcungle185  Luv4theGame I am a US citizen Who cares what they say They have nothing better to do with their time Bushranger I believe it is within my rights to use this information and finally close this issue because Cung Le has specifically stated that he is a US citizen I will now go and revert his pages if you think I am violating Wikipedia rules Please let me know and I will stop Again I am trying to handle this as civil as possible His twitter account is verified and is listed on Facebook page CungLecom and on the OFFICIAL UFCcom page This is the UFCcom page his tweets are clearly shown as well httpwwwufccomfighterCungLe
