Remembering 911 

I am placing Mr Cunninghams Filmography before the Remembering 911 section because it makes no sense to place the latter before even mentioning that Mr Cunningham directed The Path to 911  I am also introducing Mr Nowrastehs article with a mention of the controversy surrounding that film because otherwise there is no context whatsoever for his article here  I am also providing a citation for the article as well  Furthermore I dont believe its necessary to print the entire article just the section relevent to Mr Cunningham Please discuss here if anyone has objections or would like clarification
