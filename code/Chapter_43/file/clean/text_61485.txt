Hes one of journalisms most beloved and respected men but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and youll find a review of his Emmywinning reports his bestselling books his 20 honorary degrees Until recently you also would have found this sentence 
He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld a former Miss South Dakota and author from 1962 until 2007 when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage
The Brokaws marriage is very much intact a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009 Likewise ABC News Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols
A rep for Brokaw said he burst out laughing when he heard about the supposed affair Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland Sawyer sent back word through her rep that as cute as Tom is she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker shes traveling on
The purported affair anonymously added to Brokaws bio on Feb 27 was deleted after five days Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post would constitute a vandal edit but doubted the vandal could be found
Its an open system says Walsh People may use it to exert their views But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors Its incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure theyre accurate
Walsh surmised that someone with some agenda was behind the post Or maybe theres more than one person Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaws bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults though not the unflattering picture of the newsman which reminded one reader of Clint Eastwood saying Do you feel lucky punk 
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr who it was falsely claimed masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy
Brokaw isnt the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods says a source at another network news department Weve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders
But the unflappable Brokaw isnt calling for any investigations Through his rep he said This is beneath comment
