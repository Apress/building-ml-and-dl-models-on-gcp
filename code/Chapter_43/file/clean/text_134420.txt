No the text that I entered is not an opinion but a reasoned statement It is not an interpretation but a reasoned statement It may be that you are right that there should not be a separate criticism section but given the first part of the article this reasoned statement can be put here My suggestion is that more people think through what the article would look like but including the reasoned statement in the main body of the article It is useful to have the text available in the article before the whole is reeditted to prevent innocent readers to get a wrong impression
