Well I dont want to see her pontificating as though an elder statesman of the site To me it was only yesterday that she first came to my attention because she had banned one of Wikipedias finst editors who she deemd a dangerous sock  his crime was knowing German she forwarded that knowledge to among others Jimbo and Slim Virgin  both later claimed not to have even bothered to read her evidence  However the editor was banned  had he not been one of my close wikifriends  she would probably have got away with it and the editor remained banned As it was he has not returned and she still talks as though authorative  he was just ne of how many I wonder
