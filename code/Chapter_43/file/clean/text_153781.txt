Hi

  My name is Subramanian  Subbu for short It is only recently that I came to know that AYikudi Bala Subramanyar of the village Ayikudi near Tenkasi near Tirunelveli is our Kula Deivam ANd the I did make a visit to the temple WHile my visit was memorable I thought a lot needs to be done to bring back the lost glory For example the temple tank and surroundings need some real cleaning The temple also needs some face lift SO this mail is an attempt to first get hold of all like minded people who have visited this temple and those who value this temple highly either because of ancestral liks or otherwise In a way this is an attempt to create a commuinty and later on we can decide collectively on what can be done

SO who ever
