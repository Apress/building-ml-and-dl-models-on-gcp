Vegan rebuttal 

Hello

I have been following this vegan debate and I have to point out a failure in your revision

You seem to be writing from a mainstream American or Western point

Most of the world does not shop at supermarkets  they shop in open markets  and specifically the majority of vegan would go out of their way to support small independent grocery stores not chains

With regards to All cuisines again this is an important issue

You get your point for knowing Asian food but it is important from a vegan point of view to show that vegan diet is not something alien from another planet as one contributor wanted to add but something local and traditional to all nations and races

One does not need to list all nations  Asian Mediterranean Arabic Chinese Japanese Scottish Italian African South American etc but yet they all have specific vegan dishes and ingredients which most metropolitan vegan sample

A modern vegan will tend to eat a far wider range of foods than a regular omnivore and the topic out reflect it

What is the specific benefit to writing supermarket or excluding all of the above apart to your ego

Likewise there are many other sources to buy such products  such as the internet  so it is utterly unnecessary

Let it be
