Thats untimed not untamed  Dwayne Rudd committed a foul on the last clocked play which directly led to a loss  He took off his helmet and threw it thinking the play and the game were over but they werent thus the foul  The penalty was tacked onto the end of the play and the other team used the untimed play to kick winning field goal
