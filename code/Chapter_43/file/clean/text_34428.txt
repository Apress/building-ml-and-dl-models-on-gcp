Thats the funny thing I never posted any personal attacks I merely asked people NOT to contribute without first having watched the NTSB briefings and I blacklisted guys who overandoveragain reverted edits without obviously being aware of any single NTBS media briefing So yeah I am the one whos kinda suprised impressed and disappointed  I never came here to argue with you guys but perceiving QA as an attack is so telling for the atmosphere over here
