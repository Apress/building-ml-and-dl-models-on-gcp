Would you take on a project 

There are two users currently both with a weeklong block for edit warring over an article Che Guevara photo although the blocking admin is vacillating suggesting an RFC which I know is useless One of the editors UserRedthoreau I tangled with a while ago and ultimately ended up nominating the article in question for FAR WikipediaFeatured article reviewChe Guevaraarchive1 The other editor UserDamiensrf I dont know but his current complain is that 61 quotations in an article is too many 

The blocking admin User talkEdJohnston wants to handle the situation constructively but does not know how I suggested to him that someone like you an experienced editor might be willing to be a neutral editor between the two focused on article quality

I suggested you and perhaps also User talkGeometry guy to direct the warring editors to concentrate on article quality My experience in the past with UserRedthoreau is that he does rather well when a father figure type takes an interest Some of his obnoxiousness I believe is due to youthful aggression and ignorance I think he would respond positively to someone whose goal was to produce a quality article As he dominates all things Guevara the only way to improve the Guevara articles on Wikipedia is to move  Redthoreau over onto the side of the forces of good

Since the focus would just be this one article and your job would be to render advicejudgement on article criteria I think the job would not be unduly burdensome Redthoreau had a past mentorlike relationship with UserCoppertwig and did very well when pointed in the right direction behaviourally Of course you may not be quite the right model there

Would you consider taking on this project It might be just up your alley I figure that since Redthoreau is not going to go away he may as well put all that energy into writing articles that dont have 61 quotations in them How about it   Talk
