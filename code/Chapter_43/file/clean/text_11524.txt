Hi there 
I am a new user about two months and live a peripatetic life migrating from Nepal to St Paul Island Alaska with frequent stops in Othello Washington where I grew up ages ago Im 51 I have had several careers but now work as quality control and health and safety person seasonally for a small fish processing plant on St Paul island to finance my travels
 
My WP editing is mostly typos and usage stuff see slaying slews on my user page adding links to deadend pages and I have started participating in some AfD debates although not many I have created one new article the short and rather minorly important Corfu slide
Ive had one small runin with another editor see Re my copyvio tag on User talkNorotonregarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio I apoligized to him although Im not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed
 
The primary reason I requested adoption was that I am looking for some direction on copyvio matters I hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and I seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article 
Looking at WPCV I seem to get conflicting directions The first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact the second box titled Article saying to revert if possible if not then blank the page etc
Then I see this Some cases will be false alarms For example if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL Also sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia In both of these cases it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future in WPC which would seem to allow most of the things I have tagged andor deleted

I have done different things at different times deleted copyvio and left a stub if I think it notable proposed speedy blanked and listed the Article option and with one exception my mistake which I apologized for I havent received any feedback  or  I must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same but still
Here is some examples
 

New page West Wisconsin Telcom is a copy from the about page of you guessed it Wisconsin Telcom The page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page 

Marriage Equality New York Inc is copied from here

Altoona community theatre which is copied from hereand here

What is the proper way of dealing with this
 Propose speedy delete and leave page intact
 No clean revert so blank and use copyviourlwwwwwtnetaboutusphp and the rest of the stuff in the Article box
 Leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business

Wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting WP pages and policies I have no problem being bold but also dont want to be a jerk It would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion
OK thats what Im really wondering about right now I have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until I get some direction on this
Thnx
