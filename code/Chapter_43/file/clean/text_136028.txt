Yes I believe the article was originally called Double placenames but was then renamed List of  Somewhat confusingly there is also a Wikipedia page CategoryDoublenamed places which refers to what would more accurately be called reduplicative placenames such as PagoPago This suggests that double is rather an ambiguous term since various sorts of doubleness are conceivable Wouldnt Amalgamated placenames be more accurate
