RIR it seems obvious you dont like the presence of Usana corp reps by your attempts to discredit them immediately upon arrival by asking Jean314 for proof of vandalismsock puppetry but none of the 4 behaviors in the inappropriate notification policy apply to this request for insiders
Spamming Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand
Campaigning Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a nonneutral manner
Votestacking Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions which may be made known by a userbox user category or prior statement Votebanking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group similar to a political party in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage much as a form of prearranged vote stacking
Stealth canvassing Contacting users offwiki by email for example to persuade them to join in discussions unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed

Neither of the 2 corp accounts have any say in controversial discussions and I would prefer they dont even comment on those  My original request was to have them point out inaccuracies in the article of which they have sourced proof is wrong  Items we have no idea they are incorrect unless someone pointed them out  I gave appropriate notification in my RfC of which noone was yet responded about the controversial issues we are discussing
