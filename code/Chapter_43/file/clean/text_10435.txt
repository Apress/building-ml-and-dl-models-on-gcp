Youre right Milo  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology  Only that Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field We dont ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star  We really dont care what they have to say  And of course we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology and more so than with other articles on science  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say

Even if I were pushing parapsychology I still would not try to censor the critics because that would only detract from my case the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash

For stability reasons I dont think the article can take that approach It would require constant maintenance and neverending dispute resolvements  Nealparr that is why Im talking about an ArbCom decision  I want you to continue with what you are doing  It is great to get it stable for now with this definition of NPOV  In fact I doubt there will be much that is materially different when we get it straightened out  I wrote everything I wrote from the perspective I would think the article would eventually have anyway  So you know exactly how I would think it should be presented  There are only a few tweaks Id make different like calling it a scientific field to begin with and possibly saying directly which types of psi scientists in the field think are real  So keep doing what youre doing OK  Talk Î¨ Contribs
