The thing is 
Flags out neutral to non Spanish viewers because flags dont mean anything to them BUT NOT neutral to a large part of Spanish viewers because it shows a false fabricated unicultural vision of Spain the unitary vision of Spain is a right wing view and a clear residue of Francos cultural genocide between 1939 and 1975 as much as Wikifrikiuser tries to obviate it
Flags in it represents a point of view that will not mind non Spanish users as they dont know what they are and it represents a neutral and real multicultural point of view for Spanish viewers not a biased and fabricated one as what some people here are trying to impose
Conclusion Flags in shouldnt offend anyone because its the real thing flags out offend as its a lack of respect and authoritarism for supressing the reality
