I am a Libertarian Conservationist which I assume is similar to Green Libertarianism but I vehemently disagree with the OP that we support the Carbon Tax andor Carbon Emissions Market Trading Scheme These great big interventionist policies instituted by State exploited Big Banksters and Corrupt Fat Cat Financial Kleptocrats is totally incompatible with the very core basic fundamental principle of Libertarian small government It is an artificial market to sell an artificial product legislated into existence by parliament which attempts to transact the nondelivery of a nonproduct to a buyer compulsory required to acquire under government threat of force It is so contrary to Libertarian principle that the OP must be experiencing severe cognitive dissonance to assert such a scheme could be supported at all by any Libertarian or else the dont know anything about Libertarians at all
