I think the article reads pretty well The quotes far from being turgid are essential for explaining Its a real relief to read a wiki entry that actually quotes the subject and his critics rather than trying to ineptly summarise them Youre right there are a few repetitions but the controversy section certainly is of interest Indeed I notice the Daily Telegraph quoted it in full on Saturday suggesting it is of interest to their million or so readers

A criticism section would be welcome Im not sure what you mean by the practicesintegrity section since as the Sourcewatch entry on Hari shows they contradict each other Eg Littlejohn accused him of being on drugs on his show Private Eye accused him of pretending to have taken drugs when he hasnt They seem like a contradictory jumble of accusations none of which come from credible sources

If you are looking for wiki entries that need tidying up I can think of hundreds that need it urgently However if you proceed I will look forward to sparring with you on it
