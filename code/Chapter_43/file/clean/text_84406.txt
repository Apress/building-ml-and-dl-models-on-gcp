Well as for Bynes her fathers surname doesnt really match either does it I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and dont necessarily mean much In 1900 sure but at this point everyones changed their names and intermarried enough that you cant tell who is what by last name Why wouldnt Elis father be Jewish Hes Joseph Cross also the father of actress Flora Cross who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Elis mother There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish Crosss out there anyway Well in the case of footnotes the point is really  the list is called a list of Jewish people  so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is Jewish The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish I think adding a quote about Elvis ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and its for the most part something that biographers added on after his death so it would definitely be helpful But in cases like Bynes Lauren Storm plenty of others its really mostly irrelevant if they are not ethnically fully Jewish and besides that can be found out in their entry same for the other XAmerican lists establishing that someone is ItalianAmerican is good enough for example on List of Italian American actors Im sure Tina Majorinos mother isnt Italian with Italians unlike Jews you can obviously tell that if someones mothers maiden name is Black they are most likely not Italian but the source just calls her Italian so thats good enough for us Family tree stuff isnt the most important Plus  of course  most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half  but Ill go over them below here As for practicing Judaism  well of the people who are half and whose one nonJewish parent didnt convert in the 1980s  LaBeouf was raised Jewishpractices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mothers side anyway Grey raised Jewish Flynns mother apparently converted Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasnt Carter quote says his father is Jewish only Bynes says she is Jewish and we dont even know which parent actually for the longest time Wikipedia under someones assumption had Jewish mother But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts  Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish ditto for Baldoni Paxton quote says all we know that she is Jewish maybe her nonJewish parent converted Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother he doesnt know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway Prepon we dont know which parent Reeds brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sourcesherself have called her Jewish Schwartzman  dunno Sigler mother converted Thomas raised Jewish and the source says his father isnt anyway Vuolo father converted Wilson raised Jewish I think thats about it So as you can see for a large number of these the quote already says that they arent ethnically all Jewish if that was relevant OK as for JInfo yes it seems to definitely fall under some guys website It does sometime cite sources right But often it doesnt So I would say yes generally do not use it
