You care about it as apodictically demonstrated by the fact that you responded and that you changed one of your lessthanliterate edits

 Regarding the bias and illogic of your edit the excuse in your edit summary doesnt make sense as it doesnt explain why you deleted mention of Prof Deutschs endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory particularly since you yourself called Deutsch an eminent physicist in your own edit ie that statement wasnt there before of which argues against the notion that you consider the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe Further you deleted mention of the fact that Prof Wolfhart Pannenberg who is one of the leading theologians in the world has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tiplers position that the Omega Point is consistent with the JudeoChristian God

 So by your own words you must consider Deutschs endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy and yet you deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where you yourself agree that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God Moreover in this edit you delete all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian Prof Wolfhart Pannenberg who is one of the worlds leading theologians has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory

 Your edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that its a sick joke744222208
