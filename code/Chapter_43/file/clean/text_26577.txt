Are you sure you cant edit User_talkDavid_Tombe It looks to me like its not protected anymore Dont underestimate the amount of research admins do before deciding on an unblock request You can also assume that a lot of them also read the ANI discussions concerning you when they took place even if they did not participate I think your best strategy will be to lay low for a while then make another unblock request pledging to follow all Wikipedia policies including those concerning block evasion and sockpuppets and to assume good faith concerning your fellow Wikipedians from now on
