about your comment on Elaragirls talk page 

Hello Dev920 I couldnt help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading Esperanza so Im sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy or Elaragirls I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza and some editors how shall I say this contribute less towards the mainspace than others  As for the governance issue I personally dont understand the current structure and I dont feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate

I still think that an offWikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanzas page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia Whats one more click of the mouse Just so you know I had participated a little in the coffee lounge but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist offensive and not at all belonging on Wikipedia Because I had participated only to a limited extent my overall edit count 2971 as of  wasnt seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza the Kindness Campaign and Concordia and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant chalk it up to my own shortsightedness not to Esperanza as a whole

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you Elaragirl and others have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself Thank you for that

Since Ive typed this much I might as well invite you to review me at editor review Thanks again for your participation in all of this
