First of all I was only pointing out that your use of the term soldier was incorrect and that it can lead to a general acceptance of the SS as legitmate soldiers an already dangerously common view  I was not jumping all over you by providing a technical insight which is significant  And additionally I never in any way called all rapes supposed crimes I simply pointed out that German women who viewed themselves as liberated from Nazism or war lived under a regime which would have deported them to concentration camps for having any sexual involvement with anyone considered untermenchlich could have decided to reward or celebrate with the liberators and then obviously for their own protection claimed that they were raped when Nazis came asking about it  Additionally they could have been Nazis or related to Nazis and would not have been able to confess Russophilia Do you realize that I am a racially German girl living in the United States  The level of emotion in your personal attack demonstrates a level of fanatism that is very strange  I also never addressed and therefore never condemned you suggestion that women should have a voice  If that is something that you want than it is on you to persue it we are busy with our own research and cannot do yours for you  However I will warn you that you should be very cautious about believing anything written by German women as they may likely be Nazis and will have a very biased approach to recording the mass rape by the Russians and would likely outright exaggerate it many Nazi women openly admit to Western historians that they greatly exaggerated the rape of the Red Army for pro Nazi and anti Communist causes for Gobbels

I am not a Communist nor ethnically Russian so I do not understand why you think I am being revisonist  If you have your own agenda please share this with us

I also advise you to aplogize for your personal attack as I will be reporting you to ANI
