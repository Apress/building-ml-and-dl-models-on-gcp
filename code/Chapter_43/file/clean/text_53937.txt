anthropomorphic bias 

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens  

and I want to add

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype  Direct anthropomorphic considerations of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term  I think one danger is that by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions  Next thing you know biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism eugenics and gas chambers  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms  These concepts while connected to a degree should be covered carefully 13718641143
