Just received this  This has been an ongoing struggle with this gent to accept the fact that the ISBN shown should just be dropped It predates the ISBN process as I have indicated in the error MRow He has already admitted to errors in these citations  I have completely researched this effort including going to the national library in Australia  This has been an issue for weeks now and has not been resolved by him  Thoughts
