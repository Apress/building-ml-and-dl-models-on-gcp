Cozumel 

Hi

My data on Cozumel is from my own personal experience as I just returned from a week long stay on May 19 2007  I based my comments on what the local divemasters themselves stated about the status of the reefs and the recovery  The dive group I went with was comprised of several people that had visited just one week prior to Wilma and they also stated that the reefs had not fully recovered
