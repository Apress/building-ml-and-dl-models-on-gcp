Update a few minutes later  Alright I split up the footnote into three separate ones  There is no card catalog number for the 16 millimeter film of the First Tuesday NBC television segment  Just go to the film library and ask for Janis Joplin Portrait of a Ripoff  It was broadcast shortly after the January 1971 release of Joplins posthumous Pearl album which got a lot of publicity because she was recently dead at the time  If this is not good enough I give up  You wont hear from me again  Other stuff I put in this very popular article was deleted by Wikipedia regulars  are they considered vandals   I dont care anymore    dooyar
