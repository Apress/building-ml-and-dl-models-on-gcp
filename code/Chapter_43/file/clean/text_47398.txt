Each in turn

Suggested In physics force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass change in the rate or direction of its motion and is experienced as a push or a pull instead of In physics force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull
The addition of and is good However a force need not be perceived to exist The definition of acceleration is indeed confusing to the lay person but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead
Provide definition momentum quantity of motion
Hmm this isnt exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is in fact both mass and motion Again the wikilink I think should suffice but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer I want this to be intelligible but Im afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more
Following the development of quantum mechanics it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that according to the standard model of particle physics changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentumcarrying gauge bosons Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a force are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these bosonmediated fundamental interactions In modern physics only four fundamental interactions are known in order of decreasing strength they are strong electromagnetic weak and gravitational1 Highenergy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the force of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einsteins Theory of General Relativity
There is a slight issue here with the sentence Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a force are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these bosonmediated fundamental interactions This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level A single bosonmediated fundamental interaction often has a force associated with it For example an electron accelerates because it emits a photon this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron One microinteraction still a force since a mass accelerated

I will implement the wording I think is good but lets keep discussing the problematic wording
