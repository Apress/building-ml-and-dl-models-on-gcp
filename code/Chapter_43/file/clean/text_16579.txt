Hello Gwernol 

I am glad to be back at wikipedia again after being rudely blocked for a month for little to no reason I assure you I will do exactly what I did before being blocked that is only contribute to wikipedia I write this to you because I want you to know that I think your actions were irresponsible and only furthered my theory that many wikipedia admins are pompous and overzealous I dont want to offend you in any way because I know you would be prone to blocking me if I did I want you to at least understand my point of view being that you acted irresponsibly If you dont want to listen to me I understand If you never want to speak to me again I understand I just feel I was mistreated and that if you are as responsible as you think you are you would at least try to make it right Again no offense should be taken from this I just want to talk

With all due respect
