You are being a hypocrite yourself in the regard that you yourself violated Improper Consensus Building when you ignored the discussion dating back from December 2009 You are simply abusing user power then accusing me of doing so You also ignored my requests to wait until an Admin settles this and then lied saying that I want to work together with you when it appears you have no intention The record is all there Why you continue to lie in the face of the record being present is appalling You yourself need to read this How experienced editors avoid being dragged into edit wars The Administrator will see in the record that you continue to ignore that you made zero attempt to engage in discussion You need to read this carefully yourself
is consensus
How not to achieve consensus
Dont edit war
Dont simply state your position over and over without explaining your underlying concerns and interests
Dont canvass other editors who agree with you
Dont give up when people disagree on a specific proposal
Dont take a hard line position to extract concessions from other editors This often backfires and undermines the reasonableness of your viewpoint
Dont question the other partys motive
You  also reverted Financial North too 4 times in 24 hours as well I can and will also say you and Binksternet are ganging up on me which constitutes as abuse Ive filed a WQA against you and Binksternet
