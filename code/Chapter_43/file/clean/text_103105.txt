Arbitration  do we need it 

After some good sleep Ive looked at our ArbCom case from another perspective Its in fact a war about a couple of links Well the arbitration will start in 20 hours but Id like to suggest the last proposal every participant recuses himself from editing the links in questioned pages for a few months and we just leave that to other editors The ArbCom will accept the case but well a peaceful solution might be better Ive posted more on WikipediaRequests for arbitrationA different view Just think about that and about whether you really need arbitration and if you agree with that just sign there Its the last chance for a peaceful resolution Thanks in advance   comm Wikipedia Neutrality Project
