Uh oh you called my bluff I am intimidated by the number of images you possess 7000 And though I am a painter and teacher I am blissfully ignorant about most workings of the computer I think that the best way to go would be to upload them to the commons put captions on them and place them under the proper headings here I would also suggest you ask a more experienced art editor than I someone like Wetman Caravaggisti Ewulp or Celithimus for their adviceyou will find their contributions throughout the histories of artists entries maybe theyll say Im all wrong The other option is to continue placing pictures in articles but even when there are a lot of them I actually hate deleting images once they are up either because of my own reticence in undoing what others have done or out of respect for the visual image That being said if there is any way I can help I would be glad to It is clear that you have a great collection of photos and that you are very generous Best regards
