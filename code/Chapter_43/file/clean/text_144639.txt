Your 7 year old might want to check out the Planet Rock website theyre in the middle of Rush month and theres a minisite there dedicated to the band  You can listen online to the station too but not sure if it works outside the UK  Rush are a band that completely passed me by until January this year after I started listening to PR  I now have 3 of their albums and next time I go to a record store Im going to look for A Farewell to Kings
