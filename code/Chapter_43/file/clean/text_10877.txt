Hmmm maybe it needs to be made more clear It is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic Like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess not quite the same as stimulants dont cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift Thing is how do we reword it so other people understand  Thank you for pointing this out Mattisse  T1k
