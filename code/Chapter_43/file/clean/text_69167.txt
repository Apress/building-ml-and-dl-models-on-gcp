As Ive already said there was a similar drop in Putins popularity before the 2004 elections so thats not a new story Reflecting in the lead every up and down in Putins ratings is a heavy WPRECENTISM and WPUndue weight Also as was already said in the discussions above there are different explanations to the booing story  reflecting them all means putting too much weight to this trivial event while not reflecting them means nonneutral coverage At the same event Putin was applauded and it is not clear who was the person the booing was directed at Its a sign of bias and yellow press style and its quite a pity that BBC and likes put so much attention to this episode Note that Putins popularity started decline before that event and while I dont know the latest opinion polls it is clear that if the popularity goes up that would be against the theory that that episode was somehow significant while if the popularity goes down that would be likely connected to the elections story rather than to some trivial episodes  Talk
