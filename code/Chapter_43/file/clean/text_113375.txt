A barnstar for you 

  The Civility Barnstar Your recent edits on historical Jesus deserve this star because you used a novel approach that didnt give civility for its own sake but where it was deserved Many people have tried to edit pages on Jesus Religion in Nazi Germany Religious views of Adolf Hitler etc and run into the exact situation you described When they approach it with too much civility they get run off and bullied by teams of Christian editors Its about time someone approached the situation with the civility that is needed Brother I have run into so many dubious sources and whats worse absolute abominations and interpolations on legit sources Theyve been doing it for 2000 years is it any surprise that Wikipedia wouldnt be a magnet for Christian interpolations Whats worse if you remove it it gets reverted by not one but two or three others and they watch every page religiously Theres a group I estimate of about 100 who have ruined Wikipedia and some of them are admins
