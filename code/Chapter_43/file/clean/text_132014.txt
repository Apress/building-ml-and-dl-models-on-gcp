 So which aircraft was it guys In the text of this article somone tried to change the references to an SBD Dauntless that shot Sakai too a TBF Avenger without changing all of the text calling the aircraft an SBD So what is the truth of the matter Most of the references online that I have seen refer to an SBD Dauntless rear gunner having done the deed but it is possible it was a TBF Avenger So whats the final verdict because the articles text on the incident is confusing   0403 6 September
