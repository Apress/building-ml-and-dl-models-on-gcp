Notable alumni 

This section badly needs cleaning up I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support here first A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced  no source must mean no inclusion The second prerequisite is notability A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps Looking at the redlinks some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested Take Mike Pointing for example If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WPAthlete If he has just played for their academy then he doesnt If Michael Latham is an influential filmmaker why doesnt he have a page My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that redlinked or unsourced people should be moved here This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated Views please   

Im with you TerriersFan Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion they can be added back when the burden of proof is met   

I too agree with your suggestion Thanks for taking this on
