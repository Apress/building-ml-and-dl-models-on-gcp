Wait where am I saying that there isnt a centralized regime  And yes Castille and Aragon etc were independent from each other As you know in those times this monarchy was called Spanish as it had the same meaning as Hispanic or Iberian But using the name note this is just a name problem Spanish Empire today when we have a different concept of Spain causes confusion the most positive effect that can happen Thats why there are now words like Iberian Union that didnt exist at that time but historians created them for some reason and thats why the names DenmarkNorway and Kalmar Union exist too Again this is a name problem because the meaning of Spain today changed although I say again the castillian and the portuguese empires were never together Thats why this article will not be stable locked icon hello but OK if you want keep it as it is now I can shut up I have much to do all I said was wrong this is an awful OR and I was wrong in the encyclopedia I do not want this to be used as an argument after this lets use just historical arguments in the discussion I wont comment here your last post sentence by sentence but I can comment it in your user page if you want Off the record Ill just ask you some quick questions and please note that these ones are not to be used in a possible future discussion about this issue
Why isnt the Holy Roman Empire in the map
Why does the Iberian Union name exist
Is Portugals exclusivity granted by Philip II of Spain the same as any other of this monarchy
Are historians always right This remembers me a lot the Columbus article
