You know this has touched me I was really wowed by the impartial way in which the other administrators handled this Very fair and forgiving That said Im taking the advice of  and posting here Im guessing he and Hiding will read it anyway Mentoring If you like I dont think there will be any issues with my edits per se as most would have a hard time proving they are detrimental as opposed to beneficial to the articles Methodology is a different case and here we get into the grey area of how Wiki guidelines are perceived  the source of so many arguments No I dont heh have a medical condition Unfortunately I have a lot of pride and particularly so in my hobbies one of which is comics Having a photographic memory and being able to pretty much cite off the top of my head character appearances does make me a tad arrogant I have to work on that As far as I know Im the only one that actually rewrites whole FCBs accurately and while this is great for Wikipedia I sometimes forget that others may contribute in different and smaller ways as these efforts are no less important

Nightscream I bear him no ill will Well have a chat on the relevant pages about style but that can be worked out I think he perhaps took the styles changes that  and I pushed for in Ultimates the wrong way and seems to have followed me ever since As  has spoken to him about wearing the admin and editing hat at the same time Ill leave that alone Anyway feel free to throw anything else youd like to say to my Talk page

Regards
