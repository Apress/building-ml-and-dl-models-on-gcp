As the dog returneth to his own vomit 

Brief history On my return from holiday last week I discovered that another editor  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concertparty aimed at articles substantially edited by him During May 26h I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him above which closed the matter between usThe following day I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators one of whom is  The entire correspondence with him reads as follows

Discussion involving youYou might be interested in the discussion on my Talk Page here which indirectly involves you It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself  talk Seen all that Out of context of course in every sense In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages Id hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on But thats all right Regards  Yes the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind talk 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a selfindulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up blocked me and disappeared again reappearing on the Administrators Noticeboard waving my scalp around The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WPNPA

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself or I before I was blocked could have blanked the comment perhaps with a warning on this Talk page I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him As it is  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case

Anyway that said I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here

 I hope that I have demonstrated that were at crosspurposes Frankly however youve made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us You might just as well have blocked one of us at random

 Thank you for yours Youre the dogs bollocks

 Point taken for what its worth I had initially understood s complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourettes syndrome

 Thank you for yours I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding I have also had a look at your User page which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course To answer your point I did see how to request an unblock but as the block was only for 24 hours and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by s posting on the Administrators Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block I also dislike complaining to Admins about other peoples behaviour it just seems a bit wet to me and I dont do it myself

 Firstly thank you for the link which I would otherwise have missed Secondly an apology for this post of mine on the Administrators Noticeboard Giano  Sympathy is limited The contentious nature of the page in question was twice pointed out to you by me and I also requested that you calm down theres no need to post the same thoughts across 3 different forums Nobody appointed you Arbuthnotfinder
