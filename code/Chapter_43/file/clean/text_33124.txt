Your edit to TalkJVC 

Hi Im  When you added a section to TalkJVC you seem to have dropped it into the middle of an existing section I corrected that moving your section head and text to the end of the page I also replied and corrected your punctuation and spelling Please take the latter as a suggestion for improvement and not a putdown Normally one is not supposed to edit others talk page comments for such things but really it was pretty awful If you like Ill put those back
