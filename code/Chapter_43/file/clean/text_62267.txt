Conflicts History
 I welcome anybody who are interest to view the conflict history though I do want to tell you I do not leave a trail of hatred In fact I do become friends with them sometimes and asking them for advice its one of the best way to acquire knowledge Open your mind let other give you the insights in which you havent forsee for your long years The more open mind you are the more wise you are the more mature you will become
Note that most of the conflicts have already been resolved
