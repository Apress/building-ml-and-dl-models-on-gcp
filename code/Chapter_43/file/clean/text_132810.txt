reunify to bring together again something esp a country previously divided
I really dont see any argument here There is no point of view that Crimea was never part of Russia and there is no point of view that Russia has not annexed Crimea whether or not one wants to recognize it Occupation and reunification are not mutually exclusive they can occur at the same time
