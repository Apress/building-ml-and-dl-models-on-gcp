Template figures shock 

The main template lists 875 treated for shock for Israel To be fair it should list the number treated for shock in the other two columns But to be realistic this is a POV measurment since Hezbollah and Lebanon are probably lacking the treatment facilities to treat shock victims I say it should be removed altogether from the tally
