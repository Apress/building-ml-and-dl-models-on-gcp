in this context and certainly would not think of looking for an article entitled Massacre of Braybrook Street in this context  Roberts has been inside for more than forty years  Again many people will think that not unreasonable in the context of his crime  Roberts is engaged in petitioning the courts for a release date under the Human Rights Act  This in turn will lead users to look to this article for biographical details  The facts about his career in prison are irrelevant to an article about the crime he has committed they belong in a biographical article

Against that biographical details of Roberts are slim  He committed his crime aged thirty hid out for a few months and has been in jail for forty years  Prior to the crime he had done little of note to appear in a biography  He has done very little of note for forty years  Some more detail about his earlier life is probably available but it would need a lot of legwork around newspaper cuttings libraries to find it and many newspaper archives of this nature went in a skip years ago without digital copies being made  Therefore a biographical article will never be large but the Wikipedia guidelines should be sufficiently broad to take this paucity of information into account  The preceding unsigned comment was added by  talk  contribs
