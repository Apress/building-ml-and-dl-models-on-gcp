You appear to be new to Wikipedia I apologize if I offended you that was not my intention However what you did was improper in my opinion A better option rather than deleting my comment which I imagine was embarrassing to you as I exposed that you were trying to insert your own original research into Wikipedia would have been merely to add a note that your ideas had been published elsewhere Instead you chose to rewrite the history of the discussion page so as to remove your own dubious actions This isnt appreciated nor is attempting to call my edits vandalism when it was you who was trying to cover your erroneous tracks But thats all I have to say about it Better luck next time
