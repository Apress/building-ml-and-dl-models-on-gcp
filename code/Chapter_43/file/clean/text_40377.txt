I do not regard my edits to the wikipedia as partisan  It would take the most unintelligent reader to presume that Nairn voted other than with his party on Work Choices  In fact it would be noteworthy if he did not  I think the rest of my edits on this article eg providing formatting for references for less than complimentary Nairn facts suggests that I am other than partisan  Furthermore another editor has also reverted the change indicating thereby that she agrees with my reversion talk
