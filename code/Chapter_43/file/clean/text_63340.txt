There are a couple of concerns about my recent edits here  First I added links to Redwood for Redwood forest Long Island for New York Island and Rocky Mountains for Canadian mountain in the Guthrie lyrics but Im not sure if those are the most appropriate articles to link

Secondly I dont know the origin of the Canadian lyrics  hopefully my excerpt isnt a copyright violation  0054 2004 Nov 15 UTC
