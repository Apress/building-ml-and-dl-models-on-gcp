Christian arabs
Hi Could you please stop enforcing the category Christian arabs on non arabic Christians living in the middle east This is wrong We middleeastern Christians though not arabs have gone through Arabization and that needs to stop We are not arabs We have our own ethnicity and we shouldnt be forced to be called Christian arabs If a Christian European is born in the middle east should he be called a Christian arab because of that reason alone Please understand they are Syriac Christians ie of Assyrian ancestry and most of them speak Aramaic though a lot of them are forgetting it As someone who speaks Aramaic you should respect this fact and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because theyre in the middle east We are not closely related to the arabs from Saudiarabia We have our own ethnicity please stop forcing upon us some alien arab ethnicity Thats oppression Talk 1217 26 Jun 2007 UTC
