Can you please remove all of the blank space on this graph by reuploading it because it is not only unsightly but its now very unuser friendly for those of us that want to see it properly Besides we dont know if there will be a snap election or not unlikely I know but we dont have and are not allowed to pretend we have a crystal ball are we I can understand you not wanting to reupload it now because it will need to be updated in May as agreed as per its talk page so if you want to wait till after the local elections by all means do  Cheers mate 1308811446
