Thank you the best Wikipedians I am not Jewish 

I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this article I have only been reading about the Holocaust call it what you will the last few days of course we read and learned at school I think these articles are so superbly balanced and impartial that they are a credit to Wikipedia I learned a lot and I thought I knew it all

Thank you once again A credit to Wikipedia I am not Jewish I shouldnt need to say that it shouldnt matter But I make it clear in case it sounds partial accidentally As a Gentile or whatever I learned a lot of detail I didnt know

They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn But at the going down of the Sun and in the morning we will remember them

When I go to a rembrance service I remember everyone who fought for the freedom Wikipedia exemplifies it The freedom to be wrong Without that we are nothing
