ACT OF VANDALISM BY KRAKATOA KATIE

This person has completely obliterated all of my contributions to the Billy the Kid article KrakatoaKatie has replaced what had been the most detailed and accurate account of Billy the Kids life that has appeared on Wikipedia so far and reverted to an account that contains absolute garbage This was done as an act of PURE VANDALISM by a person that has an agenda that has nothing to do with improving the content of this article Quite the contrary  the clear intent hear was to destroy that article  WITH MALICIOUS INTENT  and replace it with something inferior that takes the treatment back to a comic book level I ask any board members editors and Wild West History buffs associated with
Wikipedia to look at my last version and compare to what KrakatoaKatie has replaced it with I ask all of you to compare this act of vandalism by someone with an agenda to the contribution made by someone who has a proven 40year track record as a Wild West historian I hope you will all speak out and prevent this sort of thing from happening to others who are making an honest effort to improve the accuracy of Wikipedia articles Please make your feelings known Hopefully you will agree that my article should be restored THank you Jack DeMattos
