Hey Im really glad you liked it Drawing it was as fun as I expected And I wish heshe was successful in hisher intentions to see such a species vanishing would be heartbreaking Meanwhile his close brazilian cousin Eustrombus goliath may be facing a much worse fate Im skeptic about such things in Brazil and It is hard for me to believe a serious plan of sustainable exploitation of aquatic resources specially regarding this species will ever see the light of day And If by any miracle it does It will never have proper management and sufficient funds and so on I hope Im wrong about it
