I apologize but my point remains 

Hi I apologize for calling you rude But i think my point remains if a word or a specific form of a word is rarely used it becomes obscure or archaic Believe it or not language is defined by the majority of speakers who live in the present day Formulae is a particular variant of formulas that has fallen out of favor or common usage Now since Wikipedia is a current encyclopedia I dont understand why you feel the necessity to use language from the 1800s How do I put this delicately nobody uses this word anymore Why dont you start an 1800s encyclopedia and you can use all the various archaic English words 
  I  would like to appeal this decision if that is possible Thankyou
