Could there be another subsection called International and comestic Reactions 

I think it is pertinent to the article at this stage

The Global Times a Chinese daily apparently suffused with a glaring nationalistic view article further said that while Indias path for boosting its military strength has not met too many obstacles the country is still poor as if China is not and lags behind in infrastructure construction of course it does

In Delhi diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said 

As a side note India needs to take more consideration of external threats And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority but the UK US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures
