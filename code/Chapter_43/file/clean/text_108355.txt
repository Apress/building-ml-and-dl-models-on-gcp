Why no comment 

I started an article on Voice of the Retarded and you speedily deleted it I should think you would have somewhere noted reason for action and suggested how I could get an entry started I put in a request for editorial help in writing it but cant find any responses Sup

The Voice of the Retarded is a longestablished advocacy organization with a stable website httpwwwvornet and much influence in the field they serve They are also quite controversial but are just as deserving of a place in Wikipedia as other advocacy groups for Persons With Disabilities
