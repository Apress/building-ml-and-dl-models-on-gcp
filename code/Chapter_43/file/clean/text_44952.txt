The problem is even the statement Jesus is fictional has a large range going from the Jesus of the Gospels is a fiction to Jesus is an entire fiction  Take Sherlock Holmes for example  While Holmes is a fictional character he is based on a mixture of Dr Joseph Bell and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle two people who undoubtedly lived and there have been several books and TV programs over the years presenting one or the other as the real Sherlock Holmes  

Similarly we know that even in Pauls there were other Gospels Galatians 169 and by the time Irenaeus wrote his Against Heresies c180 CE the number of Gospels had definitely increased  The fact that Irenaeus stated that The thirty Ã†ons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism but was more than fifty years old when He died Book II Chapter 22 is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say In the work often cited Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies regarding some other point  While Wheless ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE a space of only 39 years then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was as the Gospel and all the elders testify  One does not need to be a scholar to realize something clearly is messed up somewhere
