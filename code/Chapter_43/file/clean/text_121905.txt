Hi Andrew my take on the wiki policy is that it is intended to avoid intellectual elitism I agree with that intention I dont take that to mean that it directs us to ignore the standards and definitions of our profession It is a typographic term Yes muched used by non professional typographers to mean a typeface I prefer the separate article with links to the typeface article to make users aware of its professional meaning Best Jim
