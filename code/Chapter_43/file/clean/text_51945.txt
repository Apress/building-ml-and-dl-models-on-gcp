I stand by all the corrections I made and all the criticism I direct at you And it is YOU who is continuing the editwarring by reverting without an explanation the corrections I made in order to improve the truthfulness of information presented on Wikipedia Yet instead of supporting me in that effort you keep blocking me removing my corrections and reverting to the biased and incorrect information Since you call it like that  editwarring I will remind you that for any war you need two sides Have you examined the moves of the other side in this alleged editwarring I strongly doubt it because you sided with that side and took part in editwarring Is that what you are supposed to do
