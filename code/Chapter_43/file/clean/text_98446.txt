There is no higher authority to stop users run around and delete article without talking to anyone Is this a joke Why are there some editors with special rights as you say Yes exactly I dont have a problem with content issues thats fine I took part in discussions and votes sometimes my view was the same as the outcome sometimes not Everything fine 
But here is someone who does delete articles before talking to anyone This is incredibly offensive Everybody I know and I told that story in real life says this is unbelievable and some of them already said they will think about that in the next round of donations to the WMF because it looks totalitarian that some users can do what Kwamikagami did Is it really true that the WMF will not take action against this behavior of Kwamikagami  Still hoping
