Very telling
When you say that I refuse to listen to what people are saying its because I have heard this repeatedly from many editors but frankly when it comes to POV pushing it just goes out the other ear  that quote tells me that what Ive long suspected is completely true  Discussions with certain editors are completely pointless  Since anything which does not agree with his POV is pushing someone elses POV it is irrelevant and will be ignored What some people fail to realize is that on Wikipedia consensus is allimportant moreso than any guideline or even policy and even more important than being right  If a dozen or so editors disagree with you and you alone then the problem lies with you and not them If a problem exists then you seek mediation rather than fight with everyone else
