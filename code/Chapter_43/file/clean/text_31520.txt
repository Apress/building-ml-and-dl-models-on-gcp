Fixed
Hi I fixed up the Religion in Vietnam lead with atheism as state religion first as per your request please take a look The disparity in the pie chart seems mainly caused by that US institute counting 45 ancestor worship and traditional beliefs as religion wheras officially that 45 are nonbelievers Its a bit of a grey area

Second question What do you think is better title chữ nho or chữ Hán To my mind chữ Hán can still include Japanese and Chinese but chữ nho is clearly Vietnameseonly and is what Lonely Planet uses Do you have any view Cheers
