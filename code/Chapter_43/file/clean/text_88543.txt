WhoIs Templates
Trust me let it go  It isnt worth getting into a big war over a WhoIs template  I did the same thing on User talk9419238247 and got admonished and blocked for it  Clearly people in the higher powers of Wikipedia see WhoIs templates as something OK to blank even though it says on WPBLANKING they arent  Just let it go I dont want to see another editor blocked over something silly    Talk
