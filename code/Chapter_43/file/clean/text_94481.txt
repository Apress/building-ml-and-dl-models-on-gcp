It sounds as if you support some kind of filter but a different kind from what was proposed  Was an algorithmic filter proposed  Id agree that one would expect anything algorithmic to be unreliable  I dont know whats been going on in discussions about this  Has it been proposed to ask every person who uploads a picture to click on something saying its unsuitable for small children if it is  Maybe with a link to a page of guidelines on what might be considered unsuitable
