Mr 6816411779 I dont mean to be frank but your title does assert that SO is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such The majority of the world still see it as a part of Georgia after all it was and is a civilwar On top of that South Ossetians  Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation This is also the problem logically to call it as such is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms its existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of It is for the most part still the Georgian region its more to do with logic then POV My friend Mr 6816411779 Im trying front with you whatsoever but that statement SO War doesnt make sense to me However I think that the solution is probably like Pubkjre said in regards to the Vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a POV and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldnt do good every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how muchFurthermore Im going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to I am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that soundsIn Summation I second Pubkjre we should have a Etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why
