Truce

Fair enough i understand one point that i must make clear though is that i will not resist from addingediting information to things which i find interesting etc ie Louise etc Personally it is not me who links everything but that is of little matter Also i do cite and use very reputable sources for all information that i have contributed be it books or another source 

I will however in keeping with the WP3RR and personal choice not edit anymore today but will resume later tomorrow i will add such things and i would rather that you say to me what is unnecessary Such things as lists of siblings as has been seen i have a rather bad habit  etc will be kept to a minimum Your views will be seriously noted 

As i said Sure our paths will meet again  Happy editing  this time not in such a vicious tone
