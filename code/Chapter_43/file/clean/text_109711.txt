 My talk page miszabot 

Dear Demize as per your answer on my talk page I did make the change but still the bot is not running  Can you please check out once more if it is not a concern   talk2me 
It looks like you didnt make any change somehow  maybe you clicked the preview button instead of save Anyway Ive moved the template to the top of the page and set the counter for you The bot runs once a day so youll need to wait for that I believe it runs around 2PM UTC If it still doesnt work tell me and I can check it over again for you mz 
Damn i thought I had made the changes Thanks again Demize   talk2me
