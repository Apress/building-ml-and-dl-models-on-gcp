Vandalism Manifesto Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki 247 from frustration and hatred 
because incompetent editors who have no skills no degrees no expertise usually no names have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others
Vandalism is a good and natural response to nolifers as in Get a Life who 
do 7000 edits 10000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1300
or more and are proud of it These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized over and over as long as they are in effect vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop Vandals keep nolife editors admins 
bureaucrats and stewards honest or at least busy reverting the reverts they get on their own pages VANDALISM IS GOOD It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns The Culture of Wikipedia is veryvery sick
and Vandals are needed to cull the herd SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL
