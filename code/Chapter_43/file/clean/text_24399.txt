I think the issue here has to do just with overwriting existing data  Theres four things you might want to do to your storage whether disk tape or SSD 
A initialize it B read from some area C Write data to a previously unused area and D write data to a previously used area  Bubble memory cant treat C and D equivalently  With bubble memory you cant change a one into a zero like you can change a zero to a one  the former requires special processing the latter does not  and that special processing is several times more time consuming than B or C  Its such an exceptionally slow process with high overhead that your perception of your SSD would probably be unfavorable if the manufacturer allowed you to perform it on small chunks of data  An analogy  if youre going to drive a long way to the store get everything in one trip  even if you dont need it immediately  because if you have to make two or three or four trips you wont be pleased with the result
