AntiTKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a proforeigninfluence slant  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments edits made  Comments welcome  1 Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese Japan and Korean art  While this may be factually true its a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts including all forms of Karate are amalgamations  It serves no good purpose other than NPOV agenda to highlight this as an introduction to TKD  2 Under development of TKD controversies surrounding Karates influence on TKD was overstated once again  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case  Its misleading and NPOV the way it is written now  3 Under traditional roots TKDs foreign influence is again overstated  Whoever made these edits obviously had a prokarate agenda  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection  4 Under External Influence foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with 

The article is now overstating Taekwondos relationship with SubakTaekkyon do we really need several long paragraphs all about Subak 手搏 whatever that was and the Hwarang whoever they really were and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years  Taekkyon still exists today so we can talk about Taekkyons development in that article separately noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo  Japans influences on Taekwondo are also welldocumented so why remove it  Lets keep a neutral point of view for this article  At this point it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo students guide

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd  Lets leave the text as is until we can sort this out  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isnt very POV  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb  Regardless of what you want to call it Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800s  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemizationeg korean wrestling called ssirum pan sori musical instruments minstrels etc  But the absence of formal schools teachers and formal links doesnt mean that those arts werent passed down or that they didnt exist    While tkd isnt taekyon tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art  In an objective inquiry into TKDs origins you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts culture and history  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic  The martial arts aspect of Korean culturefolk culture during Chosun times provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900s  TKD claims this history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this and the actual practice of tkd bears this out  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters students formal schools etc is NPOV and more importantly wouldnt reflective objective reality behind TKDs conception

btw  Theres a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents Subak is mentioned countless times in military historical records including Chosun records  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800s   

To keep this relatively short just a few points

1 We know that Subak has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources but we dont really know exactly what Subak actually referred to  In China the same word pronounced Shoubo was used as a general term for barehand martial arts however  thus it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way as it was a loanword
2 Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts but we dont actually know
