attacks 

Howto guide on surviving them    

Interesting but it doesnt make sense to include a section on monkey attacks or there would have to be a similar section in every other animal page There already is a page Organisms that are dangerous to humans that has a list like this  although monkeys arent on it 

Wikipedia is not a howto guide wikibooks is for that but it would be worth mentioning that monkey attacks do occur
