A clarification  Really most of the quotations ought to go in wikiquote under our policies  A section of this nature should briefly describe something about her statements with a few pertinent examples  But I personally dont care much so I wont push that point  Instead Ill note that in Wikiquote you can find some public statements and rhetoric of the sort I note is presently missing  So I see three resolutions a relabel the section to accurately represent the intention b rework the text to accurately represent the label by eg including much of the current contents of wikiquote c move much of the quotations to wikiquote and present a brief neutral description of her public statements with a couple examples from both sides of the spectrum Derex
