A problem in Wikiville 
Apparently there is a problem in Wikiville Wikipedia rules clearly state that so long as there are outstanding actionable objections against an article it should not be granted featured status Giving this article featured status violates this rule Both myself and poster Avenue clearly articulated problem areas that needed to be dealt with yet both our objections were almost completely ignored The objections still stand No one has made any attempt to address them Wikipedias reputation is on the line here
