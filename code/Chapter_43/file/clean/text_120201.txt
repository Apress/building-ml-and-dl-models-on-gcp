I have been watching this page for years and had countless discussions with the adherents of AICP  AlAhbash and I havent seen any CRITICAL link  content  material etc which doesnt contain any lies misinformation etc about the AICP  AlAhbash as per the adherents  proponents of AlAhbash  AICP And this IS the main point here as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which aspires to maintain NPOV as well as the equilbirium and those links are simply part of that equation of maintaining the NPOV  Equiblibrium
