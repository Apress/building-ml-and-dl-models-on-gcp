First off I am not sockpuppet I did create the original edits for the controversy portion as well as removing the alma matter section as it is misleading and biased in its own way However I was not signed in at the time so only my IP appears Fortunately for me others have stepped in to help revert your blatant vandalism of Kristis page The farm subsidies she has received are well documented facts and are not POV or biased They are what they are Its as if I said she was female and you complained that that was POV As of this moment I am reverting the page back and reporting you to the Wikipedia admins Perhaps they will clear this problem up Have a nice day
