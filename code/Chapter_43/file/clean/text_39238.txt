Hi Brian thanks for the offer of help which is very kind of you Yes it has become very stressful Ive taken the page off my watchlist and Ill instead look at it every couple of days in case there are new objections In the meantime to address your points1 ISBNs are never required See WPCITECitation_styles and WPISBNUses and limitations of ISBNs The guidelines apart I cant think when they would realistically be needed by readers2 I changed like most other rules it was ignored to but as with the sale of alcohol it was a rule that was not enforced Ill either find a source who says this explicitly or Ill remove it3 I will add metric conversions4 I have no idea how to find conversions from shillings but Ill ask the person who first put up the pounds conversion though I question the value of them as they must be fairly wild guessesFinally thanks for doing the nobreak spaces  talkcontribs
