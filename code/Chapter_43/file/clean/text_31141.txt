I understand what the confusion is about But for clarity lets clear this out These are the contentious edits and their summaries

 That feels like WPWEASEL

 Inferred by TBA status

 To me this says theyre on the entry list but we dont really believe it will happen

 Same as before

Crucially you only went to the talk page after making these edits These edits were then followed 4 hours and 24 minutes later by three edits to correctly format the footnotes after you were again reverted by UserTwirlypen 2 hours 28 minutes later

 If this is going to be done it should be done like this need to make two more edits before changes are fully visible

Now I have two questions

1 Can you understand why contributors could consider those first four edits as editwarring especially considering those summaries

2 Why did you not indicate in your edit summary for the last two edits of that contentious set of four that you were reformatting them and thus making consistent with community opinion if that was your goal and why did you remove the content entirely in the first place if you only wanted to reformat

I still dont think you actually broke WP3RR because the policy clearly states a series of continuous uninterrupted edits can be considered to be one revert I can understand though that this is deemed to be a minor edit war
