List of James Bond villains 

Is there anyone out there with copies of either Death is Forever or The Man from Barbarossa by John Gardner The entries for these books on the list were almost complete rubbish and have been blanked either in part or completely till correct information can be put in If someone has the right info feel free to put it Im going to try doing Barbarossa by getting the book out of the local library but I probably wont have the book till after Thanksgiving
