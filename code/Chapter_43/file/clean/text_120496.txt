Hi Rhodochiton atrosanguineus does need a short Cultivation section but I had to remove the one you added whole chunks of text are identical to the RHS source You must not copy and past into Wikipedia unless actually quoted Everything else must be rewritten Its a good idea also to read WPNOTHOW Cultivation sections are tricky to write because instructions are not allowed By all means  the RHS guidance but dont copy
