Replacing this article with a redirect to libertarianism

Given that there are many sources that say the terms are used interchangably but that libertarian is a far more common term and a less controversial word this page should be replaced by a redirect to libertarianism

FloNight thank you for your efforts to salvage this whole mess but I do not think you understand how and why this phrase is used It is a propaganda word like partialbirth abortion and merely having an article under the heading just as having a partial birth abortion article expresses a viewpoint that is biased
