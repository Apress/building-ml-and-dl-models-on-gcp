Thx  sorry 
The article is almost certainly made up so I will assume that Interesting theory but I believe you have it backwards at least in terms of notability The conflicts between an epic hero and their nemesis came first and are considerably more discussed in literature so the essay should be written to explain and show that bosses are a similar plot device etc as the epic conflicts not the other way around 
Finally in the event that the article is made up such is not suitable for inclusion on WP That is WPs loss if you ask me and you may but no one at WP will ask me and thats the point It is only one persons opinion Many peoples opinion is still only opinion but to play devils advocate somewhat it gets onto WP because it is a large enough phenomenon to mean something
