Because you dont have an account any edits are assigned to your IP address IP addresses can change so you probably would have had a different IP on the 17 November 2006 Someone else was most likely using it at this point Sometimes there are people on a shared IP address despite having completely separate internet connections I highly doubt the message was intended for you and seeing as it has been 3 months since the warning was issued it wont be taken into account others will assume the person behind this IP has changed Seeing as the message wasnt for you just disregard it it doesnt affect you in any way If you want to edit Wikipedia a lot you can create an account which will prevent messages that arent intended for you reaching you But of course its up to you Thanks User talkJames086Talk
