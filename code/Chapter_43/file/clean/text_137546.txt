Hello I see what I did became reverted Yes there is several ways to spell modern name for Yerevan Problem is that Yerevan is in Armenian The persian spelling is originally from Ilkhanid times and we see diverse spelling like Airavan Irevan Erevan and much more The spelling used by EI is one I adopted I thought it would be easy just to say Yerevan but seems people are upset I know Encyclopedia of Islam English and Turkish version will have articles about this and also the book by the American scholar Bournotian as someone above mentioned His work is considered the most important work and most authorative on the topic and is a big book opposed to several page article in iranian encyclopedia Also anyone who studies this state will affeliate it with nothing but Persian empire of Safavids and Qajars and anyone between I studied bournoutian book beofre and he spends a lot to explain about ethnic groups of persians kurds armenians and Turkic tribes dozens with specific names and islaimc denominations I think Qizil Bash Qara Qoyunli tribe name not to be confused with famous states and organization associated with names these Turkic people were not referred to as Azeris but muslim tribesmen I will get book soon and cite explanation for this I understand and I share your sincere love to own people its history and culture but this  has no any relation to modern republic of azerbaijan2424200113
