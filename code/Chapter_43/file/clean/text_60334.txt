Mr Rubin You asserted that The lede correctly quotes 31 USC 5112 but that defines coinage and the requirements for minting coins not for bills or notes which are also US The statute that authorizes United States currency notes Section 5115 of Title 31 of the United States Code is referenced in the section on Banknotes  And the statute that authorizes Federal Reserve Notes Section 411 of Title 12 of the United States Code is also referenced in that section Those references are correct and they are where they should be Please do not confuse bills of credit eg United States currency notes with money United States dollars Please do not confuse bankissued promissory notes eg Federal Reserve Notes with money United States dollars

The US Constitution authorizes Congress To coin money and Congress has authorized the coining minting of United States dollars The Constitution also authorized Congress to borrow money and Congress done that by authorizing the issuance of bills of credit known as United States currency notes Those notes represent debts payable in United States dollars Similarly Federal Reserve Notes are issued by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and those notes are by statute redeemable in United States dollars 

Each Federal Reserve Note identifies the issuing bank by the first character in the notes serial number For example the letter A represents the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston A complete list A through L can be found in Federal Reserve Bank The Organization Cetificate of each Federal Reserve Bank is on file in the office of the US Comptroller of the Currency Each certificate lists the names of the private banks that own and control the Federal Reserve Bank named in the certificate

United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes are not United States dollars  Those notes are evidences of indebtedness not money as the word money is used in the US Constitution Please understand the distinction between money and notes payable in money
