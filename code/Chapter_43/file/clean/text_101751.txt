Sfacets reply to uber 
   The following conversation you will find on ubers talk page it clearly shows he has personal agenda here he calls other people idiots and now he has others against me i do not care if all the world is against me i can manage that but he is the one who calls people idiots and more 
   No Personal attacks 
   With regards to your comments on TalkExecution_of_Saddam_HusseinExternal_Links_26_Spam3F Please see Wikipedias no personal attacks policy Comment on content not on contributors personal attacks damage the community and deter users Note that continued personal attacks may lead to blocks for disruption Please stay cool and keep this in mind while editing Thank you Sfacets  
    
   I only state the facts Sorry I dictate my External Links edits per Wikipedias policy  UBeR   
   Does the policy also cover calling other editors idiots Comment on the edits not the editor Sfacets   
   I dont believe I ever called you an idiot If I did I apologize and will remove it  UBeR   
   First of all he did not apologize second of all again he replied to sfacets who i believe is an administrator that he is just following wiki policy no he is not as simple as that 
   Why should I waste any more of my time the above is black and white
