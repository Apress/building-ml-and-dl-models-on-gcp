Howdy 

I see we have some common interests

I remember reading of the cancellation of the Arrow in AvLeak when it happened I was upset then but had I known about the U2 photos I wouldnt have been No use for an interceptor with nothing to intercept

My primary interest in Earhart is in the mystery I have arrived at an opinion which satisfies me but not without much investigation and introspection

I am a bit concerned when I see stuff like the outright assertion that radio communications were heard for days after she failed to land at Howland

Although I was born in the first half of the last century I missed the golden age though my library didnt

I had the good fortune to talk to a number of the old heads and understand why some folks on the Earhart discussion page cannot comprehend the nature of the time and thus have problems with context

I have been trying to get a feel for the contributors before I spend any time editing

Most of my work on the Wiki has been on lighter than air and atomic weapons
