I would like to add my agreement with Kierzek Pincrete and Nick As to what Jonas said about our readers wanting to know what Hitler said when asked about the killings that is precisely why I feel we should not include this quote particularly a truncated version that only includes his response The problem is that the quote does not tell us what Hitler said when asked about the killings it tells us only what Henriette von Schirach claimed that Hitler said when asked about them To conflate these two things and then present his response as if it were somehow validated or confirmed that he both said that and felt that would be to do a great disservice to our readers in my opinion
