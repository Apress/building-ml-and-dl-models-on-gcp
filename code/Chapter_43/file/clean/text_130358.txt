As I said earlier I respect the victim Maybe you didnt read my earlier comments in this section But it doesnt matter whether you or I respect the victim Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion and I have stated this fact again and again It is one of the main policies of Wikipedia Besides can I ask how is keeping her name a secret going to protect her dignity It is not the victims but criminals who hide their names The girl had done nothing wrong but wrong was done to her Why should her name be kept secret People should know who that girl was Revealing her name will be true respect to her This was the same thing her father said too and you think that by hiding her name you are respecting her No you are doing the total oppositeNot only that her name is completely verifable Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion but still revealing her name will inspire people People made a publicity of her death and you say Im the one disrespecting her Looks its easy to blame those weaker than you If you really respected her you would have said that those who made her death a publicity event were the ones who didnt respect her Tell me can you say to a political leader who is using her name for political agenda Of course not because hes way more powerful than you Its easier to blame the weak and tell themtheyre doing the right thing but we cannever do that to those more powerful than us Think again before saying that I dont respect her Her father and I share the same opinion that revealing her identity will be true respect to her Tell me will you say that her father does not respect her
