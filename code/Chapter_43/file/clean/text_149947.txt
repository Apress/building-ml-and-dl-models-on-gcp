Im too tired 

I am way too tired to debate with Everyme right now and I am getting extremely tired of that users high handed debating style  IE I know the rules way better then you so shut up and stay in your corner  So I am going to be quiet before I say something stupid in that debate  Ive said my piece and even tried a compromise version which Everyme shot down as a Strawman argument and that I should stop distracting the discussion  On a side note I am getting really exhausted of that user bandying around all the policies like we dont know them  You know where I stand and what I am worried around  Thanks for letting me vent on your talk page
