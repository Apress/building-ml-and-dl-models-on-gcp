I mean really they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith adding information that was included in an already used source Their edit summary didnt show any hostility so you should not retaliate with any Odds are they havent even looked at their talk page so your comment wont be read anyways If the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out maybe this is a problem you should see about solving instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you Plus Antoshi already warned them on their talkpage and they have not added anything since showing that maybe they have listened to the advice Your threat was completely unnecessary Maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added but rejected and why would be a better option 
WPAGF and WPBITE are very important Like I said in the dispute resolution page I dont mean to make any enemies I think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects Although your attitude when people do things against your wishes needs to be worked on if you wish to avoid further complications  TalkEdits
