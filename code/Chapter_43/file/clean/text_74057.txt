21st century 

The period history articles go up to the 20th century As we are about to enter 2016 in the 21st century I wonder if perhaps there are some things of historic record or interest which have occurred in the present century Many changes or developments have been covered in the Economy section but there must surely be more 

Id welcome any ideas on how to bring this up to date with a new 21st century section or whether this is indeed needed
