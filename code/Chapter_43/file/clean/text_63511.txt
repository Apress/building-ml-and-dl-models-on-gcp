Hello again  

Well  seems to be working out well  I patrol CategoryProposed deletionendorsed and add the empty boilerplate then fill it in  this manual tedium may lead me to write my first Wikibot 

On a related note Some Other Editors appear to have embraced the Flag templates for deletion warnings as witness the size of CategoryFlagged articles and CategoryFlagged editors  I manually examine them once a week and remove the Cat from articles that have shown improvement  cleaning up the editors is a bit more labor intensive though

Happy Editing
