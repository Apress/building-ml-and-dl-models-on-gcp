Restructuring 

Okay let me explain some of my restructing
I removed the history section because I dont think it will ever be expanded The records of achievement is pretty much the history of the team 
I adjusted the lead paragraph Excluded is rather POVleaning even though it was the truth I changed that to the withdrawal which is the official usage 
I grouped all the participated competitions together so that it looks organized
Removed the statistics the Taiwanese team is not even in any of those tables 
Reformatted the Roster section Since its the national team its really unnecessary to include the flag when they are obviously all from the same country 

Good work on the article AQu01rius   Talk
