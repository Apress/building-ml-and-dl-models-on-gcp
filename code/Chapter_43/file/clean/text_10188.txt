DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB so why blame the christians rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent who had refused to worship adam also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN Old Testament 2 Samuel later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul Satan by Pharisees Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS revelation also reveals woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious The Devil had pride then disobedience then Jealousy then slander then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar murderer and thief
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions Why so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA who was a TEMPTER Jesus even spoke to St Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St Peter like wheat whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven who became too full of himself later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM all do except for ONE ANGEL later called LUCIFER He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay however GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB some mention that in ISAIAH O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL but I also consider it to BABYLOON as in revelation fallen fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life GOD has talks with the SATAN so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a nonentity as GOD does not talk to nonentities Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil others realise that this is negative nonsense I know that people were possessed by demons fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming Ha Jesus you Nazorean what hast thou to do with us hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us Jesus then would tell the demons to shut up or be quiet So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible some truth is also in the Quran
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits Pagans invented their gods and invented strange myths concerning their false gods

Jews and Christians had the opposite GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY AND THE LIFE
