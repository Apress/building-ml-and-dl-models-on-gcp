Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was you didnt immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others Ive bumped into Very much appreciated A rare quality  I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter 

While there are occasional exceptions a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world new or old doesnt show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line For instance FYROMRepublic of Macedonias title  lists Macedonian Скопје pronounced ˈskopje Albanian Shkup or Shkupi1 their two largest demographics There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities

Also I would like to note the WikipediaNaming conventions geographic names specifically states 

The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names  ie not must be 

It further clarifies the point with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line

Relevant foreign language names one used by at least 10 of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages ie Armenian name1 Belarusian name2 Czech name3 or ar name1 be name2 cs name3

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10 of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place I dont believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers and should be used in articles with caution

Notice the words and should be used in articles with caution I think its pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts

I think perhaps youve misunderstood my motivations here a bit The issue for me wasnt whether the names could be mentioned they obviously always should be in there somewhere but exactly where in the article they are mentioned Unless it is historically important eg Constantinople any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities
  
Im sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions Id even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me to confirm I have or have not convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions

Thanks in advance for all your help
