undent  Heres what IMS says However natural progesterone and some progestogens
have specific beneficial effects that could justify their use besides the expected actions on the endometrium and  Micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone used in association with oral or percutaneous estradiol may be associated with no increase in risk or lower risk than use of synthetic progestogens for at least 4 years and perhaps even 8 years of treatment

That seems pretty positive to me Sorry its not discussing compounded bioidenticals but the article makes it clear that it is discussing bioidenticals as does Boothby when referencing the same data Compounding does not define bioidentical anywhere but in your mind Yes they are associated but that does not mean that they always go together

Heres another quote from a NAMS postgraduate course  BHT is principally a construct within conventional HT that can usually be fulfilled by the use of existing commercial products that are familiar to all practitioners There are valid reasons for prescribing compounded BHT for an individual patient including lack of response from conventional manufactured HT greater dosing flexibility lack of a commercial equivalent and especially patient preference  They were teaching that almost three years ago You talk a lot about convergence and I think that some of these articles are converging on a place that you cannot or will not see because you are so focused on only what you want to see
