Editing on Hypertension 

Hi DocJames 

As a long time wikipedia watcher I feel like Im talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages Im a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently and now that Im getting to the end of my training Id love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training 

As you can see Im fairly new to the editing scene so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated Regarding my recent edits on the Hypertension article as I mentioned in the talk page Im basically trying to find a way to get rid of the daunting wall of text problem that I feel the article has at the moment Id like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering whats that can browse with relative ease As such I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content most of which is only relevant to medical professionals on specific pages and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points Let me know what you think about this approach and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit
