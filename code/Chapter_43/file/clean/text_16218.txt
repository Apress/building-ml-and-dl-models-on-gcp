Early Life

Can someone confirm citation for early life Im pretty sure he was brought up in Hoylake not Prescot and attended Hibre high Schoolcan be confirmed if we fall to arguments
Im confused now caldyhilbre every 5 minutes S

Daniel Craig attended Hilbre High in Hoylake and played for Hoylake Rugby club  I put this yesterday but someone delted it all  I am going to add it again and if its deleted again I will report the person doing it so dont bother

He also did attend StEdmund Arrowsmith in Prescot Merseyside  I think just for one year c198283 I added this  but someone has deleted

Pic
What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top Its current and its a much better picture Sure the top one is more real but its a little too real Like just rolled out of bed poured some beer on his cheerios and walked out to get the paper kind of real When I brought this page up I said Yikes That guy is uglier than Roger Moore The Bond pic does him justice though  
Id rather leave it as is Alternatively you could find a better image to replace the roll out of bed picture  
No problem just figured Id run it past you Im sure if there were any public domain photos of him out there that are more flattering a better Bond fan than me would have found one by now Happy editing  
Someone needs to get the correct pictures back after some idiot decided to replace the pictures with pictures of woman I fixed most of the references in the text thoughthey changed them to female as well ie actressher  1612  18 March 2006UTC
Done Im sure vandalism will increase the closer we get to the film being released Just beware 

Born during the Bond film series
I know that Craig was born the year after the release of You Only Live Twice and the year before On Her Majestys Secret Service am I right I just put down a year before On Her Majestys Secret Service He was born in the Sean Connery era right not George Lazenby
Its correct but I wouldnt say Lazenby had an era at all  
I would say Sean Connery era because he returned in Diamonds are Forever in 1971 after Lazenby in OHMSS Lazenby did not have an era The preceding unsigned comment was added by  talk  contribs 

Introduction to US audiences
I dont know if its correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didnt do Lara Croftlevel box office was still a substantial success in North America Thoughts  

I hadnt heard about that but its no big deal to me either way I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue If there is clear evidence of Elizabeths priority I have no problem with that  
Im not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper  

While its probably the better film  and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar  from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one Certainly he wasnt one of the main stars who were pretty much Cate Blanchett Geoffrey Rush Joseph Fiennes and Craigs Our Friends in the North costar Christopher Eccleston
