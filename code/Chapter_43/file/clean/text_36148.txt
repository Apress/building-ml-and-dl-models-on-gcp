I have restored the OR tag It was removed by HighKing without any discussion and he then had the gall to remove it again following a restore and to claim BRD in doing so The fact that it was put in place by a user who is now known to be a sock is totally irrelevant but the main reason for putting it back is that this article is total 100 OR There is no comparable treatment of this dispute anywhere else All weve got are a few people groups and organisations who sometimes complain about the term and dont use it We have no demonstrations in the streets about it no campaign groups exist You dont see posters anywhere denouncing the term There is just nothing other than some random opinions This whole article is a complete fabrication It could almost be regarded as a hoax article It is here simply to promote antiBritish Isles POV We might as well have an article about the dispute as to whether curry or fish and chips is the national dish of England Such an article would not last long even though Im sure we could find loads of references and opinion pieces on the matter Conflicting opinions do not equal a dispute Could someone please put it forward for deletion Im not sure how to do this   Talk
