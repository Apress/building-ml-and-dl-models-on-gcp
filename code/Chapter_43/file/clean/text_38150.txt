It looks that you are so obsessed  to associate  certain terms and professions with the Ezhava community There are many ignorant people editing wikipedia articles no doubt you are one among them
You consider looking like a Dalit is Bad
Fair skin is superior
Your  sick mind will churn out more epithets 
If you want to know about your looks you need to know about the first order Tipu sultan gave to Nairs after capturing MalabarThis order in its orginal form can be seen in the mysore museum recently I found the same in one sitesYou can just read it here below

Here after you must proceed in an opposite manner dwell quietly and pay your dues like good subjects and since it is a practice with you for one women to associate with ten men and leave your mothers and sisters unconstrained in their obscene practices and are hence all born in adultery and are more shameless in your connections than the heasts of the filed I hereby require you to forsake these sinful practices and live like the rest of mankind and if you are disobedient to these commands I have made repeated vows to honour the whole of you with Islam and to march all the chief persons to the seat of the Government162

Martial Race
This is a British invention Martial races are intellectually inferior people who would fight someones war and get killed for somebodyThis is one of the reasons why Pakistan invaded India 4 times There are many martial tribes in Pakistan who assumed that they can defeat a bigger Armyindianas one pakistani is equal to 5 HindusIt has been proven wrong again and again
It should be noted that Nairs never challenged the supremacy of Brahmins and KashtriyasVarmaThey were always obedient servants who fulfilled every wish of their masters
