Please sign posts folks  Im sure the Jones link will be scrubbed  That said if youre looking for humor Id say it was hilarious when Rothschild claimed Jupiter was closer to the sun than earth  It was also hilarious when Jones said Take me lord Rothschild take me in immitation of a woman being impressed at Rothschilds selfgiven title of adventurer  Also Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neofeudal empire he did however infer that his family was involved with such  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil  Anyway if were to believe David de Rothschilds book then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars and build straw houses  If anyone can show me a Rothschild of the actual European banking line that doesnt live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house I will actually waste money on this chaps silly insulting book  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book  As for Rothschilds demeanor of course he was somewhat calm its part of the training  The best liars are always calm because they have gone to schools where that selling point technique is taught  Its called public relations and it only works on dullards in my opinion
