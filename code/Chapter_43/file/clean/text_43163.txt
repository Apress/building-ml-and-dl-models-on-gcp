OK This may soon become a pertinent topic whether we like it or not due to the clamor over more and more prominent Republicans showing disdain for the direction of the GOP leaderships positions Im not just talking about Colin Powell and Christopher Buckley but pockets of people all over the nation in recent times diverging from the party line who are calling themselves Goldwater Republicans Eisenhower Republicans etc Both Pat Buchanan and John Dean have been saying these things in the media for around a decade or more that the GOP leadership isnt truly representative of a conservative position on the major issues that concern the United States This isnt POV its really just whats been happening and with Colin Powells recent revelation on last weekends Meet the Press this has become an issue that is blatantly and embarrassingly visible
