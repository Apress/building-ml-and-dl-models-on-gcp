Please reverse this merger The simplest and most important reason is that aside from its function as a thyroid hormone thyroxine is simply a chemical compound that should have its own article For instance go look at the triiodothyronine page and youll see the standard chemical description page there with molecular weight chemical formula IUPAC name etc  a wealth of information uninteresting to and therefore absent from the thyroid hormone page this link now redirects to The original thyroxine page should be restored with all of this chemical information Regarding some of the above discussion  it is true that thyroxine produced in the thyroid can be either enantiomer and that the isolated levothyroxine enantiomer is what is in the drug This is specifically interesting because levothyroxine can only be converted to normal T3 not reverse T3  which is the other enantiomer This has physiological consequences for those on the drug So I think this is good information that we should add to the Thyroxine page once it is restored  but I dont think a separate page is needed for that We just need the separate Thyroxine page back to have a place for that information to go  along with all of the now absent chemical information since merger with the Thyroid Hormones article How do wewho can reverse this Thanks20611275195  mjd
