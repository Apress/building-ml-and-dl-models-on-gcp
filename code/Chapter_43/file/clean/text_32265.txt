On second thought Id ask that you just give your final evaluation of the article the next time you look at this If you think the article fails in its current state solely because of the dead url I disagree but thats fine Given the pace at which our discussion is moving however I think renominating it and getting a fresh review seems like the fastest route to its revision and passage This review is just moving too slowly has become too adversarial and seems to me too disconnected from the GA criteria for effective collaboration to be possible
Sorry this didnt work out better I do appreciate your improvements to the articleyouve made a lot of good suggestions
