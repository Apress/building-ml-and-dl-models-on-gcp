I dont want to go about beating around a dead Bantha but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order In one shot we see Palpatines face becoming the Sidious of the OT followed by more lightning to the face After a few closeups on a conflicted Anakin the camera focuses back on Palpatine who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin and then fading away and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says hes too weak to continue If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting why did his face go from normal to Sidious to seminormal and back to Sidious again If the lightning wounded him wouldnt the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and reappearing Watch your DVDs youll see it I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to By the way both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood In the commentary Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the true Sidious drip a bit more menace Thats all well and good but there must be a withinuniverse explanation for it
