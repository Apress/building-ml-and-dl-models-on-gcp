Succession boxes
I noticed you added back in the succession boxes in the article for Without You Badfinger song While the general opinion in various discussions at WTCHARTS is leaning against them a true consensus has not been reached and it would be great if you can add to the discussion to give reasons why you prefer to have them for songs and albums that went to number one on any chart Thanks
