Myopic is not a swear word it simply means shortsightedness and was in line with his opening remark which i took offense at Most intelligent rational people WILL assume that a 9 year old is immature clearly implying i am neither of these while emphasising the word Will this by definition is shortsightedness since he clearly has no knowledge of history Secondly speculating on someones background is not an insult and that is joke if you think it is well unless you seem to think being a christian is insulting he clearly divulged his religious background when he said he would be busy with Christmas so i was not speculating on anything nor did i comment or imply that being christian is negative so their wasnt even an implied insult

this entire matter is a joke if your holding me to these standards while i have seen far worse remarks elsewhere and nothing is done by any moderatoradmin or whoever waves the stick around here
