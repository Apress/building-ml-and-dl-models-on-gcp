Unblock request 

The length of this block is excessive when you consider what actually happened See the comments by Marx0728 on the User Talk page of the blocking admin for all details I will do my best to refrain from disparaging motives of others in the future

Also since several editors appear to have this page on their watchlists Id appreciate it if one of you would transclude my Strong support for the currently proposed voter registration section on the ACORN Talk page Thanks
