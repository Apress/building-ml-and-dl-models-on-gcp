I like your proposal and also the discussion on WikipediaPushing to validation If I had a vote I would vote to approve the proposal Saying this does not help with my current my issue Even validation will not help with the issues I see Because an editor can easily find a cite that is not correct  You could cite this and your article looks correct Without actual learned knowledge you cannot discern this  It would be like the expert tag but instead in edit mode just flag the person in edit mode that to edit this article they need a working knowledge of the subject matter This would not stop them from editing it just warning about this The tag could only be added or removed by an admin  If this is possible  When you return I would love to discuss this with you further  There are article out there that have been wrong since 2005 and other editor build on the misinformation And thanks for replying as I said this can surely wait till you return  talk  contribs   count
