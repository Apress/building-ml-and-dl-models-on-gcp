Sun7 Chesterfield Series 

Hi Falcadore Ive started an article on the Amaroo Park Sun7 Chesterfield Series but have left blank 1972 and 1973 in the List of Winners table I was wondering if maybe you have Racing Car News  September or October editions for those years which should have the Sun7 final results to complete the Winners Table Or maybe the Giant Killers magazines would mention the winners particularly if it was Bondy Thanks Cheers
