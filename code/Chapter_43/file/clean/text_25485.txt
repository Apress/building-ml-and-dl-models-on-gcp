Em excuse me but I did nothing to warrant your edit summary I simply tidied the section as I thought best making no comment on your edits I simply pointed out that you were incorrect in your assertion that users cannot edit their own talk page and that I thought you were overly aggressive on the Spore talk page I supported the addition of the endgame to the article and have not removed it again I was tidying I dont quite understand your use of San Francisco or they or the fact that the entire edit was direct at ClosedEyes who I dont see in this discussion page And finally I didnt call you uncivil I said you were bordering it which you are Thanks
