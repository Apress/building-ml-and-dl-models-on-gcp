Oh I see actually its using completely the wrong font Wikipedia doesnt have many fonts installed for SVG rendering if you need a font not listed at mSVG fonts youll have to use the Object to Path command under the Path menu Also you might want to consider whether PDtext could apply to the letter images I suppose it mostly depends on whether the font used is considered a common font
