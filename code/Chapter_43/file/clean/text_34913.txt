around 

This article is nicely written since it details the historical use and not just the words origins and definition  Circa literally means around in American English I remember vaguely that in British English about carries the same concept of following a curve or circle  I added around since about isnt often used in this sense by Americans  Also there could be links to circumference circumvention and other cognates
