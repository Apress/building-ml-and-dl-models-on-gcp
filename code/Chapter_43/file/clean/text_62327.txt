I take no pleasure in being correct 

You will notice that my account is no longer blocked  Do please take a step back from the hostile and combative attitude that you have displayed  Wikipedia is not a battle unless a user chooses that it be one  In the future you should consider a more helpful attitude rather then assuming such hubris by judging credible work as rubbish  Hopefully you have learned something from our encounter  have amended your arrogant obtuse attitude  Good luck to you in getting other valuable contributors to Wikipedia deleted  blocked  Surely you shall need it
