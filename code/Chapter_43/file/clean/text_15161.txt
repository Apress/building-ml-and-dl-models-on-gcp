Id also be curious to know why my challenging of a source was dismissed The source was put forward in support of an edit to the content of an article it was done in a discussion with me involved at the time The supporting citation was shown to be utterly unreliable not a whit of the claim was found to have even a passing resemblance to reality If an Editor wishes to put forward as support for a content edit his claim of an Oxford degree  then the claim will be considered on its merits If my questioning the purported superior authority of expertise was against any rule suggestion or even cultural norm of Wikipedia I would very much like to know this Please inform me if this even rises to the level of a faux pas Thank You 754922352
