Literal text 
I have changed According to the literal text of the constitution the GovernorGeneral is the representative of the Queen of Australia to refer to Queen Victoria instead I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister who is undeniably the head of government even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the GovernorGeneral from a cursory reading of the Constitution The Constitution declares that there shall be an InterState Commission but the truth is that this body does not exist

Please if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong  you will search in vain for the title Queen of Australia for example  or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title Queen of Australia was introduced  2344 11 Feb 2005 UTC

Skyring  It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view  I did this to make a point A point about literal text is make by using the adjective literal Your point belongs elsewhere

Anyway the literal text does not mention Queen Victoria it mentions the Queen It further states that the Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time This is what I has done Maybe there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution but Queen Victoria Thats wrong wrong wrong

Is it Have you checked the original I think that you will find that instead of checking you jumped in with some more untruths Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons  2150 12 Feb 2005 UTC

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this It just wastes time Also when you say Please Read the constitution you are showing contempt for others

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it  2150 12 Feb 2005 UTC

If you refer to the literal text of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a Queen of Australia and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution  0156 12 Feb 2005 UTC

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it Then skyring put in Queen Victoria  So I reduced it to just just Queen ie no substiution I have no problem either way  1156 12 Feb 2005 UTC

Lets stick with the Queen shall we Thats probably the best bet  2150 12 Feb 2005 UTC

I thought the point about literal text had been made but I see that it has not been appreciated The Constitution does not state that the GovernorGeneral is the representative of the Queen If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition then by all means do so but dont go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there when it clearly isnt  2349 13 Feb 2005 UTC

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement the GovernorGeneral is the representative of the Queen Nowhere s2 states A GovernorGeneral appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majestys representative That is a clear statement of intention I noted s101 previously which states There shall be an InterState Commission There is not an InterState Commission so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the GovernorGeneral is now the Queens representative given the example
