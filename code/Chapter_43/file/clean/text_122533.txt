Youre surely referring to my depopulation of CategorySouthern artists I mean for every artist who was marked with this category I removed the category

The reason was simple For every state of the US I think there exists Category state artists and certainly for every one of the artists whose articles I fiddled with there was one or more of CategoryLouisiana artists or whatever For conveniences sake lets stick with female artists from Louisiana If somebody is so notably a Louisiana artist as to deserve to be so categorized shes also automatically a Southern artist

I suppose I could imagine an artist who never stepped out of the Pacific northwest  or indeed the Netherlands or Karelia or wherever  but who yet was claimed to have a Southern sensibility But I saw no such claim made for anybody there

Thus CategorySouthern artists seems utterly superfluous 

I dont think theres much point in discussing any other contributoreditors attribution of motives and predilections to me so I shant respond If youre that dissatisfied or otherwise concerned there are channels by which you can complain about me to Wikipedia in general However Im happy to clarify anything thats not clear in whats written above and Im open to an argument for how Im wrong and CategorySouthern artists is not rendered superfluous by CategoryLouisiana artists and the rest
