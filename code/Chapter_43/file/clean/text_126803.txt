Let me also add that I understand how frustrating it is to be up against a banned editor who has no qualms about gaming the system to get what they want I have no time for that editor and will gladly help to WPRBI whenever I spot his edits But its important to separate the issue from the person The fact is it is not only that banned editor who supports the piped solution Therefore you going around changing it on an articlebyarticle basis is no different from what he did  you are forcing your interpretation on the article This issue is going to rumble on and editors who are willing to edit war to push their own interpretations will end up restricted Trust me Ive been around for long enough and have seen it time and again And the patience of the admin community is tiring on this subject The only way this will be resolved peacefully and with any permanence is to come up with some sort of consensus that can then be applied consistently If you care about this issue then please engage in that discussion Thanks et 
As above the piped solution doesnt apply in the article under discussion Second I will continue to revert edits made by banned socks  Third I will continue to engage in discussion with legitimate editors as I always do  Less of your highandmighty tone please
