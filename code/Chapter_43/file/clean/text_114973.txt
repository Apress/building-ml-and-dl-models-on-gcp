Hmm i remember reading about that in the news recently aswell Im sure if that did happen then the other Commonwealth realms would follow suit sometime in the future I doubt if any of the other countries would do anything until after the Queen dies though because im sure Canada  Australia will hold referendums on becoming republics and probably win it after the Queen does die I agree with the equal rights for male  females the bit i dont understand is allowing a catholic to become monarch How an earth could a catholic become the head of the Church of England If the UK act is passed then it would be worth a mention on this page about the legal implications for the other commonwealth realms
