Hey Andrew
Forgot to mention another thing the main image on the points of sail would be  ImagePoints of sail for single sail double masted sailboats I recently went over the sailing for dummies book again and here 2 masts with sails are shown for the schematic this is more accurate most common sailboats have only but 1 mast but 2 sails which work like a 2 masted sailboat with 1 sail per mast In a schematic it is best to simply draw 2 masts with 1 sail The reason why this is done besides being just more accurate is also because it makes a noticable difference at 180 to the wind running here sails are placed goosewinged so the efficiency and method is similar to a square rigged ship at this coarse With a image you have now 1 sail 1 mast this isnt possible and so the image if faulty in a way This is btw also the reason why I myself got a little confused at first on this I mentioned before that you could make a square rigged sailboat points of sail with this suggestion this would not be so required instead you could best make this image first and not bother about the other image any time soon
