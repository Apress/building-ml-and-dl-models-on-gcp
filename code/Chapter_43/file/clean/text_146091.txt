Proposal for a revised introduction

Okay I have a proposal for a new intro which needs to be worked on more but I wanted to put what I have so far out there Im not at all wild about the specific wording at points but I think youll get the drift  The intro has been the victim of a lot of reversions and I think it would be good for us to get that straight  Right now there is no criticism of Chomskys position on Nicaragua v United States in the intro actually Ultramarine appears to have added it back but I have a different version and I think there obviously should be  Ive also added some new stuff  Here it is and Ill try to explain what I was trying to do and what I think is missing after the proposed text The first two sentences are the same including sources though I have removed some italics which seemed unnecessary
