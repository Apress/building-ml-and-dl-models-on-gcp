You have resorted to undermining what I have written because you are simply uninformed on TNEs full history and as such you have no other defense I think that just becuse TNE was first established at Wes you must also feel that you have some authority over its history Let me ask you is The Machine the same outfit and behaving in the same manner as Wes TNE Do you consider The Machine to be a legit part of TNEs history or an illegitimate offshoot just using TNEs symbolism
