Sylar is a tyrannical monster who often toys with his victims about the fact that he is not only prepared but actively enjoys killing and dissecting them for a genetic abnormality over which they have no control He rarely regrets this and save for one dramatic event in which he laments killing his mother and has the whole Who am I Why do I like murder so much he in no way exhibits any kind of tradegy If he was gaining power to avenge a fallen loved one he would be a tragic villain If he exterminated the mutant race because he felt they were responsible for the death of a loved one he would be a tragic villain Insanity power complexes and the inabillity to do other than murder are not reasons to brand a killer a tragic villain If they were then we may as well add The Terminator and The Predator to this list
