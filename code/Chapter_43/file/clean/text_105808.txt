Editing own comments 

In the context of misrepresentation may I draw your attention to WPTalk

Altering a comment after it has been replied to robs the reply of its original context It can also be confusing Before you change consider taking one of the following steps
 Contact the persons who replied through their talk page and ask if it is okay to delete or change your text
 use strikethrough or a placeholder to show the comment has been altered
 Strikethrough is typed like this and ends up like this
 A placeholder is a phrase such as Thoughtless and stupid comment removed by the author This will ensure that your fellow editors irritated responses still make sense In turn they may then wish to replace their reply with something like Irritated response to deleted comment removed Apology accepted

Please restore your original wording so that the responses of other editors remain meaningful and consider alternative methods of making a fresh proposal
