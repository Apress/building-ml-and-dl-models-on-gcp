These two diffs by the user in question throws enough light on how serious he should be taken and the level of his integrity as a wikipedian Utcurch has a long history of edit warring and bad faith edits on yadav related pages So it would be wise not to join hands with him rather you would do well by having some discussion with me because I am the only person who for years have added cited materials on this and several other related pages FYI even admins can be blocked for 3RR so if you have integrity worth any value you should warn yourself Shame  NoBlast
