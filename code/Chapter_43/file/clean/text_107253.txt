Well about your method of participation here looking over your comments here and elsewhere one is left its clear that you either are unacquainted with our governing content and behavior or willfully ignoring them Assuming good faith Ive went with the former but if you still insist that its the latter Ill take your word for it Either way its becoming disruptive and incivil and needs to end
