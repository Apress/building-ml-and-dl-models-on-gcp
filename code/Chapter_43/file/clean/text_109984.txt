Proposed Additions to the Barton Buhtz text  

I am going to add in some other text from the Buhtz article This should help to show what the Redemption Movement is about ACCORDING TO AN ACTUAL REDEMPTIONIST BE WARNED This text is not in harmony with Wikipedias never give credit to anything that was stated by someone who later on broke the law whether or not it had anything to do with the idea they quoted with purveying unspoken rule The text will read 
Redemption movement proponent Barton Buhtz has written that when a UCC form is processed by a states UCC filing office it becomes a public legal recordfact and that those who have filed UCC1 Financing Statements correctly have not broken the law Buhtz states that no court can dispute the validity of a properly filed UCC1 financing statement Buhtz claims that negotiable instruments properly written and presented by a true Secured Party can lawfully and legally be handled via local financial institutions by theTAB
Secured Party through the Secretary of the Treasury as well as ledgered by the financial institution via theTAB
Treasury Tax and Loan TTL account Buhtz makes it clear that the UCC Redemption Process is not merely a get rich quick scheme and also warns of potential imprisonment for those who fail to follow the law in regards to this process    I propose 3 days to rebut this proposal on the grounds that it is legally invalid NOT ON THE GROUNDS THAT BUHTZ MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN JAILED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS
