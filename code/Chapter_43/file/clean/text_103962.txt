Please have my account permanently deleted
I did ask for this account to be permently deleted at the beginning of April and was told that it would be by user Musical Linguist It seems she didnt do this as was requested

It now seems that someone else has been editing using the account because the edits on April 20th and April 23rd are not by me and I am amazed that user Deskana would want my talk page unprotected  why could that be he said so he can contact me but over 24 hours later he hasnt 

Now could someone now PLEASE permanently delete it
