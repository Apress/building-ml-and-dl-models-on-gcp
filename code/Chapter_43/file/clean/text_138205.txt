Paragraph one if you are uncertain as to whether Lincoln was an important spokesman for the American System why on earth would you be editing this article

Paragraph two I used the qualifier arguably and I think it is justified to discuss the track record of the American System approach which is now virtually unknown in its country of origin to the track record of the other two options which are normally the only ones discussed Feel free to cite a success story for Marxism or LaissezFaire However I agree that this paragraph might be better couched in a proponents of the American system assert a and opponents respond with b format I wont attempt to edit it however until we get arbitration because you Andy and your cohorts are in the revert dont debate mode

Paragraph three simple statement of fact Can you name another outspoken proponent of the American System other than LaRouche Remember your dislike or LaRouche or of the American System is not at issue And just out of curiosity what is your gripe against Sun YatSen 2032 13 Jul 2004 UTC
