Wikipedia inclusion guidelines 

Hi Florenta Whilst I recognise that you are trying to do something nice for your friend by including him in Wikipedia please be aware that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information We have guidelines and policies regarding what can and cannot be included the most important of these is that subjects must be notable For a simple explanation see this page

Dan Lake does not appear to meet the criteria for notability he has not been the subject of substantial coverage in multiple independent reliably published sources and so is not a suitable subject for inclusion here There are however many aother websites which you might like to consider submitting to instead  雲水
