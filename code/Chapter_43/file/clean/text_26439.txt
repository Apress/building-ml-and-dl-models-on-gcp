Observation Only 

I have quietly observed the tension concerning my brother Jeff Merkey and all Native Americans on Wikipedia  It seems that Mr Jimbo Wales has challenges with Native Americans  If so the problem is his and not a problem of our people  Mr Wales doesnt seem to like it when anyone has a difference of opinion that himself  This is a narrow minded approach and is his problem  There are numerous others here that seem to be on the same infantile path as Mr Wales  This is most unfortunate  I will again set back and observe  These comments are of my own doing and not a product of anyone else whatsoever
