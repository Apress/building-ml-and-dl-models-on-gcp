Theres also a little state called Judaea  It was independent from about 160 BC to 6 AD and again  from 4144  although it was a Roman client after 63 BC  In the intermittent period under the Persians Ptolemies and  Seleucids the Jews largely ruled themselves through their high priest although they didnt have political independence so I wouldnt describe it as rule  But certainly the Hasmoneans and the Herods were real rulers of the region
