The part of 2  3 I dont follow is that in the wikipedia article it specifically states that the MWI explains the finetuned universe which refers to physical constants changing Which is ofcourse a blatantly inaccurate foolish statement The MWI does not explain the finetuned universe as listed The statement made says that the MWI may provide an explanation for the finetuned universe which is obviously false and inaccurate Do you know what a finetuned universe means or refers to Its no wonder wikiepdias accuracy is known as laughable with the most unnaturally foolish wiki editors141156133161
