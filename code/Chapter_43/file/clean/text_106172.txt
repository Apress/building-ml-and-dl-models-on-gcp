repress notability and COI 

Basically I am surprised at your response to my article I see many publishers with websites that are clearly COI or marketing driven and they offer nothing to the publishing world Reed for example boasts massive profits made on their page which are extracted from governments around the world with high priced journals that cost 20K a year to subscribe to not to mention their connections with the arms trade but repress a publisher that releases titles  as open access and give 100 full viewing of all books is some how a COI We consider repress to be a serious intervention into publishing as opposed to other companies who are profit driven
