I second that  This perfectly illustrates how I explain it to my friends also at least when I force them to listen to me talk about N dimensions   I noticed the X and Y colors in your legend did not match the illustrations so I uploaded a new version that corrects this FileDimension levelssvg  I hope thats ok with you  I dont know what graphics editor you used but I just fixed it with a text editor to preserve the readability of the file by your original editor
