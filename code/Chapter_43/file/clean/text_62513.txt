Apocalypse Tapestry
Why on earth has this article been deleted  The item which the article described is the largest woven tapestry in the world 
I am about to recreate the article as Apocalypse Tapestry as this is the name it is commonly known as amongst English speakers The French use the plural tapestries of the I have checked out the French language article and  as a teacher of French I will be able to translate it   
If you can make a good article about it go for it  But the copy I deleted in 2006 was not that article  Heres the complete text It is a part of the priceless collection in the Ch√¢teau dAngers and had a stub tab attached  Seriously that was the entirety of the article  Also _2006_  Anyhow I look forward to reading an article about it that does it justice  Best of luck    
Its been a while but Ive created such an article   
transplanted from my talk page I visited the page and it looks fantastic  Well done Apocalypse Tapestry has become an excellent article
