So you want to be an administrator 
When a contributing editor makes multiple individual contributions to an article in good faith  a good follow up editor will evaluate each individaul contribution to ascertain the merits of each individual edit A follow up editor with a particular negative agenda toward the contributing editor will revert all the edits indiscriminately As I see this occur I will make note of it here and on the reverting editors talk page The impetus of course is if that particular reverting editor is desirous of admin authority at some future date it would be prudent to make those determining the candidates agemda apparent for consideration

editors who have made indiscriminate mass reverts

a sxeptomaniac Adding to scripture There were no verses in the original autographs and the thought or statement of paul was incomplete

bEscape Orbit reverted one edit You reverted approximately 10 edits with one revision 

Good luck on your journey to Admin Glory
