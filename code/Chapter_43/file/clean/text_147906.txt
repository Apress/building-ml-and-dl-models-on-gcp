B1B2 

Is there a reason you redirected the article on invitation letters to B1B2 visas Although it is in regard to that visa type no where in the redirect page does it address the how to of the letterwhat goes into it etc Furthermore I had the Consular Section of the US Embassy read before I posted it to verify accuracy The purpose was to help people understand and clarify what they needed to include in such letters and your redirect does them a disservice
