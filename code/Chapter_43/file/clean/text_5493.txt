Oppose all  I was going to support things until I read Amakurus statement we should put the EU second because of its unique position in international relations and because we should focus on the country with which its relating  Meanwhile we also shouldnt have country after Georgia because this is a situation in which its unambiguous US states arent able to have foreign relations so the only time when Georgia could have foreign relations was before the United States existed and there wasnt an EU at that time  Note that we have many other articles in which the disambiguator isnt present because of the context List of Governors of Georgia and President of Georgia are undisambiguated because the country has no governor and the state has no president National Register of Historic Places listings in Georgia is undisambiguated because the US governments historic preservation program doesnt include places in the Caucasus and Coast Guard of Georgia is undisambiguated because the state doesnt have its own coast guard
