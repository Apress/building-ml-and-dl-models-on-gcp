Kimberly Williams Lacks Credibility 

The ravings written above by Kimberly Williams would probably be considered evidence of some form of emotional or personality disturbance by most people The claims she makes above lack credibility The link to Williams own web site simply contains more of her unfounded rantings Williams seems to understand so little about Wikipedia that she does not understand that Andrea James is NOT the author of the Wikipedia biography about her The information about the colleges  Andrea James has attended and her degrees from them are well known and easily verified facts The other facts in the Andrea James biography are also easily verified There is no requirement that Andrea James provide documentation about the biography of her to Wikipedia editors If Ms Williams were at all credible it would be her responsibility to produce notarized letters from Wabash College and the University of Chicago that Ms James did not receive degrees from them Ms James is a well known author film maker and activist whose laudable efforts are well documented Ms James activities are also well documented by national magazines newspapers and television appearances Ms Williams has no such credibility The evidence is clear from Ms Williams infantile response above and her infantile behavior on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet that her beliefs are the product of some form of delusion on her part Kimberly Williams does not appear to be someone with any intention of providing an appropriate contribution to the Wikipedia
