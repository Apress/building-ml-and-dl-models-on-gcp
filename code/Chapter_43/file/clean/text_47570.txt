I want to retrieve Dar tribe which has been tagged with Dhar 

The Dar tribe is quite distinct from Dhar where it is being redirected but I do not know how to retrieve the old Dar tribe article which has been perhaps vandalised by the person who has put a redirect for Dar tribe This vandalism is continuing with all kashmiri muslim tribes under totally unrelated hindu castes without any basis I think it just brings down the reputation of wikipedia as encyclopedia source
