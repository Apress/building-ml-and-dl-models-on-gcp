New Edits  

1 Added some info in the ethics section on moral philosophy adequately considered 
2  Rewrote the criticism section The quote from Gilson second handedly attributing an opinion to Fr Balzic that Maritain would be condemned as a heretic seems irrelevant It is an opinion of contemporary and not from the source In its place Ive added a list of some of the main criticisms that come up in the literature with references
