I checked with my father who worked for BR in the 1960s and he advised that the TOPS list never had a class 80  He wasnt sure about class 41 however Yes class 34 was originally assigned to the latter class 331 as well class 30 was for the latter 310 and 72 for the 730 Obviously the list was revised at some point but I would agree that it would appear that assigning class 80 to E2001 is speculation 198134262
