You could try reading WPSOURCES which will explain why someones Twitter page is not considered a reliable source WPNOTPROMOTION and WPCOI  All these will help you understand better what is wrong with your article  There is nothing to stop you creating the article again but you will have to follow the guidelines on notability to prevent it being deleted again  In particular you need to find that substantial coverage in thirdparty sources to justify the inclusion of this person  I couldnt find anything much through Google just a lot of promotional material and a few mentions in nonnotable blogs  Also if you decide to start again make sure to avoid phrases such as Her style carries an endearing childlike quality unless it is a direct quotation from a thirdparty source  That kind of wording is considered nonneutral
