As I have already stated on the RI article Talk page I am not going to make any more edits to that article for the rest of the year When the article was unlocked on February 1 I made a lot of progress on that article and it continued until Ramdrake recovered from a health issue and started obstructing progress again and he did it with the backing of Slrubenstein Slrubenstein has been hanging out on that article for over 6 years If you want to do something useful to help Wikipedia I would suggest that you review the obstructive editing behavior of Ramdrake across a number of articles and also how his buddies like Slrubenstein and Wobble work with him
