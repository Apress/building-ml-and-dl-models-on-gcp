Ah so you asked me to simply give up and let you have your way but you did so politely  I am not trying to get a point into the article  You are making a completely unsupported claim and I am trying to remove it  By claiming that I am trying to get a point in when the situation is the opposite you are misrepresenting the situation  I have already addressed your points on the talk page and its rather arrogant for you to declare that I havent  Its also rather rude to say Ive already addressed this issue see my response to others
