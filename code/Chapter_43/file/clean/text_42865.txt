In any case Depardieu has not renounced French citizenship   
This articlereference disagrees with that httpwwwdailymailcouktvshowbizarticle2251340AdieuFranceGerardDepardieulandsRomerenouncingFrenchcitizenshiphtml   
 You shouldnt trust rags like The Daily Mail 2127192145  
Seriously i dont know why i even try Next you know all newspapers are rags and diplomatic sources such as the Kremlin website are not reliable Oh wait We already went to that stage   
 As I explained above the Daily Mail   a notoriously unreliable English newspaper  s article is from 20 December and is talking about the earlier controversy about Depardieu saying he was going to renounce French nationality  It was impossible for this to be true since he did not have any other nationality to fall back on    

Alledgely claims by Depardieus Agent

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 8767143211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references   

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium Thats all for the moment

1 France did not remove Depardieus citizenship yet otherwise where is the source

2 Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship

3 Ask your Prof of International Law I did

4 See here httpwwwspiegeldekulturgesellschaftfilmstargerarddepardieuvonputinzumrussenernannta875537html Die Formulierung des Kreml wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einb√ºrgerung gestellt hatte wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert

In English The formulation of the Kremlin that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization was denied by an assistant of the actor

So yes the Kremlin lied

5 Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month

6 Ask yourself If tomorrow every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport what do you do Will you consider hes a AfghanistoAlbanioAlgerioAndorroAngoloAntiguoBarbudoArgentinoArmenioAustralioAustrioAzerbaijoBahamoBahroBangladoBarbadoBelaroBelgoBelizoBeninoBhutanoBolivioZambioZimbabwean actor
This is nonsense Putin thinking hes God doesnt rule out international law
