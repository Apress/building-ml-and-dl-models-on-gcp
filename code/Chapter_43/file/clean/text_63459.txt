Make this 69 then  The fact is very clear  I am not Oprah  Even if you dont believe it Oprah and I have no common article edits so the sock policy permits it  There is no checkuser linking me to this Derek  Oprah is not Derek per the checkuser and is nonpartisan unlike Derek so behaviorally is different The only similarity is that Tvoz a very partisan editor opposes anyone who doesnt edit like him
