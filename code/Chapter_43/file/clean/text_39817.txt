Im not clear whether a picture of a childs genitalia is legitimate or not  you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me perhaps you should ask whether images of childrens genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia

I object to it for several reasons  The is first that it is an image of a childs genitalia albeit deceased which is not usually accepted online for nonintersex children and I am not sure why intersex childrens genitals should be an exception to this  Second the example in question is quite an extreme case where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking and as you are no doubt aware it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people  So is it a representative image and link on intersex  No it is not  So why is it there  Finally I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity  just as I resist the reduction to XYXX chromosomes and all that entails  I am sure that there would be better fully consensual images available if required  although I am not sure why they are necessary  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful so the only purpose appears to be either for shock value or voyeurism neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia
