Limited support under Android 19  22 native browsers 

Im seeing some limitations in what SVG content will render properly under the default browser or alternative browsers running on Android 19 I believe this is also true for Android 22 The SVG wikipedia page doesnt provide any insight regarding Android support for SVG

Can anyone confirm what support there is for SVG under the Android browsers and update the Wikipedia content accordingly

Thanks Paul
