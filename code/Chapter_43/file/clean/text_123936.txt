Lone boatman you have repeatedly removed the word democracy from the sentence referenced cited with the National Review And you claim that you are not starting an editing war but are doing it again First you replaced democracy with constitution to support your argument that Germanys Basic Law is a constitution and after I explained that the reference cited was speaking directly of changes which move away from democracy ie The eternity clause establishes that certain things above all democracy can never be changed even by parliament and asked you to please not remove the word democracy you again removed democracy replacing it with Basic Law You claim that we must change it because the word democracy is too broad There is nothing broad about democracy especially when the topic is about protecting democracy The eternity clause make specific provisions to protect democracy as stated in the article referenced in National Review Now please leave it because your changes are repeatedly taking the article off course off the topic ie the intent of the eternity clause to protect democracy as stated and referenced in the National Review cited
