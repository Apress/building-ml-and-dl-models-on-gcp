Hi  Thanks for registering and for your offer of help  As requested by Hu12 a request which I completely agree with we first must determine whether is support for adding the IUPHAR links at the appropriate Wiki Projects WPMCB and WPPHARM I will post a proposal and you are more than welcome to take part in the discussion  If there is support for the proposal it should be straight forward to 1 add an optional IUPHAR parameter to the GNF_protein_box template and 2 add the appropriate IUPHAR accession numbers to the appropriate Wikipedia protein articles  Cheers
