Celtic Language

It says in the article that after St Patrick was captured he began to learn the Celtic language  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic eg the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland etc  So did they speak the Celt language I defer to an expert on this one 

To be more precise what the article means is that he learned a Goidelic language or the Old Irish language Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain he might have known a Goidelic language as well Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages   Talk 

Are you kidding  Please identify your source in claiming that is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace preceltic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization  Second Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Qceltic branch of the Celtic language family thus the Irish of Patricks day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language  Ergo he learned a celtic language though as noted above he probably already spoke a Pceltic brythonic language prior to his enslavement

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire these not only include Picts Scots Irish Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English I will have to dig the book out with dates  

St Patrick Fact and Fiction

I have removed was captured by Niall Noigiallach as it is an obvious error I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material

What are the sources for the following statments

1  born Patricius Magonus Sucatus
2   seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte dAzur from 412 to 415 He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417
3  Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431 and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius the first bishop who had died earlier that year 
4  There was some contact with the pope Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444 
5  Popular devotion to Patrick began in France long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patricks life are those of 461 arriving in Ireland and 491 death are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments Thank you 

Ive rerevised the article again in line with what I wrote above for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite  1852 pm 18th April 2005

Hello Pete glad to hear from you The basic issues I have with the article as you wrote it  forgive me if I have mistaken you for another editor  are outlined above I have no problem whatsoever with them being included in an article concerning Pat so long as they are placed under some heading along the lines of Speculations about St Patrick Because we know so very little about Patrick I really feel it is vital to seperate facts speculation and hagiography And  I mean no offense  much of what I have outlined above falls under the latter two categorys Thank you for your time  2208
