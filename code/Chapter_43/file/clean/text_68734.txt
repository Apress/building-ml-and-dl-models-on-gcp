Thanks for this sanity reminder Bogdan I myself added the following template to the top of this Talk page just a few days ago Remember that article talk pages are provided to coordinate the articles improvement not for engaging in discussion for discussions sake Do not use them as a discussion forum What this means is that we can not censor MarkStreet or anyone else because of their opinions or ask them to shut up But we can and should ask everyone including MarkStreet to only comment on issues which are relevant to editing the main article Edit suggestions sources etc
 PS I just archived the 300Klong Talk page as Archive 7 I kept topics open where we still have some pending issues to take care of in advance of the protection being lifted
