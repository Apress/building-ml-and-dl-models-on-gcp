What is this 

The major gag near the end of the second actwhere Homer gets raped by a pandais held in a very low light by the series viewers and honestly one of the series rockbottom worst moments wonder what the public would have thought if the one who got raped by the panda was Marge

The hell is this This is strictly POV and the last part in parenthesis is really out of place Im removing it 

You shouldnt because its true that this moment Homer raped by a Panda is widely regarded as the worst most tasteless gag in the whole series I accept that the bit in parenthesis shouldnt be there its pure POV and not encyclopedic at all  
Yes but is the worst and honestly are POV If we say its considered to be the worst no problemo  
Yeah then we agree the fact should be there just rephrased  

Agreed That was the most tastless gag ever It may have been a decent episode if it were in season 11 Or the repeating of a job for Mr Burns or the selling of ones soul OR the fact of maybe more
