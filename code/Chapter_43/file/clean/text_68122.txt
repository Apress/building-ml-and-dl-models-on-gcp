Garrigues 

I am currently proposing that the Garrigues page should be replaced by the content now found on the Garrigues disambiguation page and the the material presently on the Garrigues page should be moved to a new page to be titled Les Garrigues Catalonia If you have the time I would appreciate your comments on the Discussion page at Garrigues I hope you will agree Sincerely
