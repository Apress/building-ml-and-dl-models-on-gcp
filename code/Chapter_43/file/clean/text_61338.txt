you can make an argument for prestige with many unis  may I ask what criteria you use to make such statement

The purpose of an encyclopedia is indeed to state that something has prestige if it indeed has it  think about it  what else do you suggest is to be omitted from an encyclopedia  do you have any defined definitive criteria or are you just making statemnets without reasoned basis
