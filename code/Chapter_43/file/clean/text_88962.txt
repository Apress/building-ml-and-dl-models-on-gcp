Well there 7580125107 have it your way I find your sudden interest in removing my contribution humorous as I know it is valid or else I would not have put it in the summary believe it or not I have better things to do than to insist on posting untrue statements on Wikipedia It was born in my own words from statements which can be found on various websites made by Erica Messer the person who happens to be the Showrunner for Criminal Minds Its no big deal though I understand why you took it down and I can always update it after the episode airs Just thought Id share that Please know that I do not intend for this message to be malicious Thanks for contributing May peace be with you
