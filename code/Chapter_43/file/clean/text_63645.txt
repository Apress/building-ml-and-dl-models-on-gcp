IRS disambiguation 

Dear Ciciban I needed to revert your edit at IRS because consensus is that most people searching for the term are looking for the Internal Revenue Service and not International Railway Standard however I added your term to the IRS disambiguation page which lists other uses of the term IRS  Please let me know if you have any problems or want to discuss further  Thanks for your contributions  Best   talk
