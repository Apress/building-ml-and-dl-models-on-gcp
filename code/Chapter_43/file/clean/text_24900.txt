Things my garden center didnt tell me 

My local garden center didnt tell me that when diluted with water to a 10M solution Thuja occidentalis became a cure for some sort of disease  They did tell me though that when planted in the ground and fed water through its roots Thuja occidentalis becomes an attractive hedge  They also told me to plant it in full sun to light shade and that it would grow to about 1215 feet tall and 68 feet wide  That turns out to be a good choice for my landscape because planting another spruce tree would have been too tall for the power lines that I planted it under

Either my garden center is participating in a conspiracy to suppress the truth about Thuja occidentalis or this article is giving too much weight to the medicinal nature of the plant   Elkspeak
