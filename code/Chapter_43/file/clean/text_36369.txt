Just thought Id weigh in here We or at least I are am not saying Afghan is incorrect I actually use Afghan and would not use Afghani or Afghanistani But theres a source for Afghanistani so dont we have to include it as well I really dont think WP is supposed to be normative if thats false please direct me to the policy The version which I want to see includes all three demonyms with sources and Afghan listed first
