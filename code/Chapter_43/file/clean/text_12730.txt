 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved This applies to articles about you your achievements your band your business your publications your website your relatives and any other possible conflict of interest 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged If you create such an article it might be listed on articles for deletion Deletion is not certain but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability All edits to articles must conform to WikipediaNo original research WikipediaNeutral point of view and WikipediaVerifiability 

If you are not notable under Wikipedia guidelines creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion  If your achievements etc are verifiable and genuinely notable and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later See WikipediaWikipedians with articles   TravellingCarithe Busy Bee
