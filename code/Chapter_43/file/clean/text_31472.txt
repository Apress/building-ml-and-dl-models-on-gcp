Scope of the article
David Arts book is mentioned in the article so I think a good starting point should be what he wrote  In this book I use far right as an umbrella term for any political party voluntary association or extraparliamentary movement that differentiates itself from the mainstream rightRadical right refers to a specific type of far right party that began to emerge in the late 1970sThere has been a convergence around the term in the literature Inside the Radical Right The Development of AntiImmigrant Parties in Western Europe 2011 p 10  He then says his definition draws from Betz 1994 and Mudde 2007

My first comment is that since Art says there is convergence on use of the term we should not use in text attribution  We should just acknowledge that while there is no consistency on terminology the term normally refers to the wave of rightwing parties that began to emerge in the 1970s  We should only  use intext attribution when someone says something original  For example Art refers to Betz when he provides Betzs explanation of why these parties are rightwing

Second we need to ensure that the article is about a specific topic in this case the parties and groups that began to emerge in the late 70s and include only comments about these parties where the author is clearly referring to them  For example some writers use the term radical right to refer to parties such as the BNP but not UKIP  Other writers may not use the term radial right but may call them third wave of the Extreme Right Party family as Mudde did in his 1996 article The War of Words Defining the Extreme Right Party Family  Incidentally we should have an article that family too  Its definition is similar to Arts use of far right although that term is more usually used for the more rightwing of the Extreme Right Parties such as the BNP
