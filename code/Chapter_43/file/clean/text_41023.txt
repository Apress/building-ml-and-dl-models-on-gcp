No I am not the same person as the other IPs that user leif has been accusing me of I only have one IP that is 2416867238  Alai when you ask me if I am not 24168 you need to know that I am not the other IPs that share the first two numbers that my Ip has I even spoke to Infrogmation today Leif left a link to a page for Infrogmation to look at that had a whole bunch of IPs with 24168 and two last different numbers which is not me and also the 63 numbers which I am not either Just because I have an IP of 24168 does not mean I am the IPs that this guy is accusing me of and I am not deleting all the surrealism articles Nor do I have a vendetta against Dan I like Dan I disagree with his position on surrealism today but I agree with his position on Breton we disagree on current surrealism Do you understand 02
