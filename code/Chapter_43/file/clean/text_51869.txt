UN Security Council 
The human rights enshrined in the UDHR the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are theoretically enforceable in law In practice many rights are are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them 

None of the above have reliable sources Nothing is theoretically enforcable The UNSC MAY enforce anything that is wants to The problem from your pov is that it doesnt want to You are presuming that human rights violations are ignored and I agree but how did you and I determine that there were violations Neither of us may do this for WP

My Translation You hold strong opinions about human rights and the failure of the UN and national authorities to enforce your opinions We likely mostly agree on this Our opinions and those of commentators are merely opinions The law is what the UNSC says that it is Am I missing something here
