By not responding to the survey and providing cryptic explanations for why your userpage says you attend UCSD it is both implied and reasonably inferred that your knowledge of UCR is limited  the assumption I made and I stated it as an assumption was perfectly in order  With your most recent response it is clear that you have some knowledge of the campus itself and I will assume that this is a response to Question 2 above  Keep in mind that if you had just stated what you just did it would have saved at least 34 paragraphs of nonsense discussion in this TALK page  Your unwillingness to show at least an element of good faith is not looked upon favorably in my eyes especially since Amerique and Danny were good enough to cooperate
