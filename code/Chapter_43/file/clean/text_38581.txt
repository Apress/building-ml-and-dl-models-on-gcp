Ill be sure to schedule an appointment for an optician soon but for now how about adding an inline citation correctly The numerous citations added are still just bare links and does not specify the book page being cited as Ive noted in my edit summaries Perhaps TemplateCite book or whatever else is acceptable with WikipediaCiting sources
