Hardcore version
The statement that the hardcore version is not in any available cuts is too vague The hardcore version was widely available on VHS in the early 1990s and in fact you can find the uncut version for download online so it most definitely is available Perhaps whoever wrote that part of the article meant available at the present time ie cable or DVDBluray versions currently circulating Its also possible the uncut North American VHS release was unauthorized in which case a source would be required to this end Either way without removing the statement altogether I had no choice but t tag it as dubious for now 6814670124
