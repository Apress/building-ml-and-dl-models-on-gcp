I think the one that has gone far is the IP annonymous user He reverts every edit users make in the Dominica Republic without caring about what other user believe I been in wikipedia for past half a year and have made numerous articles and he is the first person that gotten me angry Wikipedia is suppose to be a place for concensus not self edits like the annonymous sure didRight now they are 4 peoplecounting me that go against his policies and then he warns us of vandalizing the Article

WE are dominican and we knoe the history of our country while he blames us that we are only racist and go against African BloodI think you should warn him too the same way you did to me because the only one responsible of my acts is him

You could ask users like UserDominicanUserVirtualDelight and others that know the truth and that they always back my points while IP User64131205111 I never have come here to disturb and always got along with other wikipedians like UserMoebiusuibeomen

He Accussed more than twice about vandalism and i think that if you neutral enough you should warn his of being blocked tooHe comes up here and make himself seem as an innocent editor while he is truly not

Thats all i have to say and ill say one thing moreIf he continues acussing me i will continue offending him the same way ive done it beforebecause he is not the only one here with priviledges
