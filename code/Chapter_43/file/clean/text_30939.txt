Thank you Hasteur I have read over the information and I do think I am in compliance with the COI I do not intend to use this article as a source of promotion nor use it in any sort of marketing as you can see from the article itself there is nothing in the article beyond the fact that we exist and are a real school I simply want to make sure that such an article for EBC exists as I know from my own experiences empty links are a cause for concern Whenever I encounter it in my personal life I simply have to ask What are they hiding

If anything in the article comes across as Promoy please do let me know and I would be happy to remove it

Kind regards
Paul
