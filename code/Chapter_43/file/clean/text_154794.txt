I have so little time to devote to this today So far Ive spent my entire morning dealing with this editor He just got through having it clearly demonstrated to him that it was at least 21 probably 31 consensus against his wishes hes the only holdout so far Notwithstanding that he restored all this deletions of entries that GFHandel and I have told him are inappropriate Maybe you can try to straighten him out that such bold moves must first be discussed and a clear consensus for them agreed to before wholesale deletions of material can be made The discussion is here at TalkList_of_computeraided_design_editorsComplaints_over_unfair_removal Please check his recent edits If he persists at what is increasingly looking like disruptive editing against consensus this may have to go to ANI He seems to be convinced that his views of the facts trumps consensus I have to go for the moment real life needs tending to Ill be back this evening Thanks for your efforts so far on this your above digging up of citations that is really helpful and whatever may happen with Duncan today Hopefully too GFHandel will weigh in today too Perhaps you might want to wait until after he does so
