Gregalton Youre Still A Douchebag Signed 

Im not an editor so I really dont have a problem calling you a douchebag The fact that the article considers anyone who criticizes the practice of FRB as nonmainstream raised the flag in my mind that is made me check the discussion page Youve done more to bias the article than these supposed conspiracy people probably did At any rate fuck Wikipedia and fuck Gregalton I wait for the day when Knol has a good article under the same title and its written by one of these nonmainstream economists the article talks about

Delete this again gregalton youre dealing with a loser with more time than even you so dont try 

besides its not like Im editing the main page I was looking for information and you screwed me out of it
