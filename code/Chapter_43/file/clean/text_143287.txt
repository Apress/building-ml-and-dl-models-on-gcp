Comparing bronze apples to fresh sprouts 
Ah so now you spring your little argument youve been itching for a while to do In otherwords How can Wikipedia support the supernatural claims in the Bible and not those in my particular brand new religion 

First of all Wikipedia doesnt support anything Articles are to be written NPOV  that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak rather when it is used its used in proper context In the Bible etc etc 
This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians this is not the Christian Encyclopedia  

Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting but your wording  that whatever it was called is like channeling etc  was not neutral and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter  trivial because supernatural claims despite our understanding of them in faith are not encyclopedically substantive 
This is of course the problem with religion  a little knowledge is a dangerous thing and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible Its interesting but you need to poing out specific examples and then you need to deal with them on a case by case basis Maybe you have a point here  I cant tell ATP Dont forget the log in your own BTW

Its obviously a very touchy subject but we deal from time to time with people seeking to push a POV in their writing and after a while they realize that theyve already added all the information necessary to the article but leave the writing to others Its an important distinction  I myself have a couple times had to defer to others sometimes in cases where a conflict arose between two different POV writing styles The question is are yours and mine different enought to require outside help in resolving any dispute Finally Ill let you doesnt work here  its not your article though you have had more part than anyone in developing it And I was simply rewriting it for sake of neutral tone  something which you should welcome not reject  as it legitimizes and adds to your work just as your work adds to the project Sinreg t 0502 10 Jun 2005 UTC
