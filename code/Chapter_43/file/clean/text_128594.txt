Harpers Island 

While the statement you refer to regarding JDs death is indeed from Karim Zreik Karim was not a producer for the episode in question  The wound on JD is quite clearly visible here within the episode and would not have resulted from a bludgeoning   
Regardless of what you say he is someone who read the script saw it happen and told the actor that he would die that way So due to that we must honor what he said for it was the way the show was going and not just assume that since it looks like a stab that it is Since this site is about stating the facts you need to leave it the way it was written in the show and not put your opinionated thoughts on the matter
 There is no reference to the script whatsoever in the blog entry so how can one base their thought on assuming the script was read by someone who has no stake in the episode in question  As a matter of further reference direct from CBS it is stated as a knife wound here  As such I have again reverted the article and added the appropriate external reference  I also ask that if you are going to continue to make edits and call into question revisions that you register an account so that actions can be more easily trackeddisputedresolved
