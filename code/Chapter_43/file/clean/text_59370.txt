Response to James B Watson 

Thank you for your reply
 
Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing All because I complained about my treatment lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen you just dont like it when I diagree with a point of view Are you following the orders of Blixx and co Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me  they have called me a nasty piece of work an islamist Haddads puppet etc Have you even warned them I think not So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished One rule for one and one rule for another eh
 
Thank you for explaining what the word contraversial means to me Maybe you can explain the meaning of another word for me  HYPOCRITE
 
I want to end by apologising for any offence caused but you have to understand my frustation at being treated this way
