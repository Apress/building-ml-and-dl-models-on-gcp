The talk page archive you linked to is not relevant as it concerns the inclusion of the quote not the use of the word famously  Indeed few things are banned on wikipedia but there are very clear guidelines  Why do you think they shouldnt apply here  Why do you think that this one single fact needs to be described in this subjective way  If it was silly to describe the opera itself as famous then you must believe that a critics opinion of it could be more famous and more widely described as famous than the opera itself  Thats clearly absurd  20083101199
