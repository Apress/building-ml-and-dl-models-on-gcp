Comment Its incomprehensible that a point of such importance Symmetry inflection the solutions and critical points evaluation isnt mentioned within whole article Moreover the circle at Figure 4 is unnecessary dislocated above Ssy_S omitting even a vertical line up to the center of the circle as done at Figure 2 of New approach  by Nickalls R W D see note 29 again  Tschirnhaus transformation isnt only unneeded but also responsible for such a failure hence t_S  0  doesnt mean that an inflection point S0q doesnt exist It seems to me reasonable the unknown t along with the variables p and q to be abandoned in favour of graphically grounded ones which are also easier for memorizing
