More like based off of the Reptile page which is a SA 

This stands for Shitty Article and not Sturmabteilung and Ill tell you why

Repeatedly the same internal links including MANY redirects some were just recently corrected curiously after my cleanup was reverted but only some of them
No external links whatsover still and no Gameplay section too
Gameplayrelated notes in Reception section
And more

I fixed all of this rewrote for a better flow also expanded where it is important who created him when he became playable the Nintendo Power Award 93 this kind of stuff Now its more like a Good Article alright

Reptiles page is also pretty bad Or rather used to be because I fixed it too And what is not bad My Mileena and Kitana articles for example I also fixed Shao Kahn but it was only a cleanup like here maybe more because he used to have just no reception whatsoever and I had it research and write all of it Or maybe I just have higher standards being a perfectionist but no you cant change it
