Not trying to whitewash anything but also not take every allegation as gospel 

Im writing this directly on the theory that it never hurts to have direct communication I am thoroughly confused about what you are saying about SPA and selfacknowledged CIA employee if you are referring to me 

As far as mainspace contributions Ive done a good deal in computer networking fisheries management and monitoring some medical work and various areas of interest that caught my eye I have never been an employee of any intelligence agency although when for example I worked for the Library of Congress I did work with some counterparts at NSA and CIA about shared technical problems These were mostly about how to make 1970s vintage workstations work with nonroman alphabets and how to wire up large campuses before LAN technology was commercial  On Wikipedia my first intelligencerelated contributions and those of which Im most proud dealt with the management and cognitive processes of intelligence independent of any national agency
