SD criteria 

Hi Ive noticed your excellent SD tagging work However I saw you recently tagged an article about Star Wars filming locations as original research While it certainly was that WPCSD notes that being OR is regrettably not a valid criterion  would be better for OR if you cant find a SD criterion Happily I did speedy the article as no context as there was certainly very little of that Cheers  talk
