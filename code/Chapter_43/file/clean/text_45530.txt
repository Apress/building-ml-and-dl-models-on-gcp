For the record Ryulongs deliberate deletion of my message from User talkKhoikhoi is seen in Ryulongs user contributions at 0144 3 September 2006 And Ryulongs deliberate misrepresentation of my request for help as vandalism is clearly seen in his edit summary It should be seen in Khoikhois talk page history record as well How much worse can it get You follow Wikipedia procedure by requesting help through someones talk page and then the troublemaker monitors your contribution list to spy on your request for help so that he can quickly go to that talk page and erase your request for help Then he tries to cover up what he did by falsely describing your request for help as vandalism and marking his edit summary as minor hoping that nobody will discover what he did Jimbo Wales really ought to hear about this one Just how low can a user stoop on Wikipedia
