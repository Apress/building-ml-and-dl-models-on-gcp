Well thank you I am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it and for that I shall rest my case As for the part over the assumption of good faith perhaps I may just remind that your introductory comment in my talk page as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits To revert another purely due to the unnecessarily terse edit summary is simply unacceptable in wikipedia If you have an issue with my comment talk it out in the relevant talk page and I would prefer it to be either in the articles talk page itself or in a more centralised location This is not some kind of a you vs I issue alone Others should know what happens in the background too This is a community remember not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point That you are suspicious of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action It speaks of nothing but very bad faith so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do reminds me very much of global politics for some reason D

My comments are unbelievably inflammatory Well I am sorry but I do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind and I dont mince my words You will have to get used to my bluntness I suppose as much as I have to get used to your behavior as well

The last I checked you created the three articles for alliancesm with NA at the top for each of them Now please explain to me in what way is NA the home continent for each airline alliance CO for your information was created by me way back on 10 December 2004 and it started off with an alphabetical listing and it has remained that way until 8 February 2006 when you unilaterally came along and changed the other callig it standardization No one said anything about it after this change Well I did and almost immediately I dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history and I certainly do not see anyone commenting on the preexisting alphabetical listing for a good 14 months straight even when NA is COs home continent

So now that we know just what exactly is being standardised here are you going to apply them to the three articles you created
