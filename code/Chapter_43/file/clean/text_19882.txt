added section Hoodoo Conceptual System
I added the above section and two subsections Mosesas conjuror and bibleastalisman  My goal was to add some more description to what hoodoo is by discussing some of the underlying symbolism and worldview  Im missing a quote that I havent been able to track down in Hyatts book vol 1 HoodooConjuration and soforth there is an informant who says something along the lines of if I cross someone and it works then it happened with Gods permission  This isnt exact but just an approximation  If any of you have access to this book and find it before I do can you add it and the citation in the sentence marked citation  I think Hyatt even mentions this quote in his introduction if I remember correctly
