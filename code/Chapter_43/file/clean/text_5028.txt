Greeks are indeed White people Every European native including all Southern Europeans are White people and this is according to pretty much every White Nationalist What Hasselbach stated is laughable if he really did say that since the Nordic National Socialists were in the extreme minority Hitler himself was far from Nordic

The Nazis indeed made some huge mistakes the antiSlavic agenda was what ruined them But despite this these days neoNazis generally include people from pretty much every European ethnic group including Southern Europeans and Slavic people Presently the term neoNazi is synonymous with White Nationalist and doesnt necessarily refer to a belief in the Nazi policies of the 30s and 40s
