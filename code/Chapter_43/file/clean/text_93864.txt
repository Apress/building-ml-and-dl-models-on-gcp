I think its a good idea to have both separate sublists and the full main list George youve made a good start splitting off the 5 victories list but Id like to make a few changes before we go and split up the whole list I think we should follow the example of Airline codesAll If you look at that page it is a very long list of airlines but if you try to edit it you will see it is actually just a bunch of sublists on separate pages put together My proposal is to have the main page List of World War I flying aces and then many subpages List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories AF List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories GQ List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories RZ etc I chose those names based on other list series and so that they will be able to stand as lists on their own Each list will then need some extra coding which I can do And wed have to create List of World War I flying acesPage top and List of World War I flying acesPage bottom easily done What do you think   MacInnis Contribs
