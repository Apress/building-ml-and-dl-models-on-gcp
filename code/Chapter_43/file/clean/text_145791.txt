Christian video games 

I removed a section on Christian video games because it was mainly original research unrelated to the article most of the sources were just links to the websites of Christian game developers and none of the sources related to this articles topic the few legitimate sources were just news links related to specific video games not the genre of nonviolent games Just notifying everyone in case someone wants to try to clean this up but personally I think this entire article needs a rewrite
