I dont get it 

Under the Design section the article says that First Contact was one of the first Star Trek films to use purely computergenerated models rather than physical miniatures However it soon describes the fabrication of the EnterpriseE miniature in actuality rather than in a computer I assume the lead paragraph means to say that some of the ships were entirely computergenerated This should be clarified
