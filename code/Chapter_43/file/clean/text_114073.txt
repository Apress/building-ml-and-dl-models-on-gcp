Cultural depictions of George Byron 6th Baron Byron 

Ive started an approach that may apply to Wikipedias Core Biography articles creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc which has become a featured list  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion Id like to suggest this as a model for the editors here  Regards
