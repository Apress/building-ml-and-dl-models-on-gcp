Dylan and the AfD 

I dont understand how you can vote to Keep an article that has listed on it convert to Christianity for Dylan I am of course referring to the AfD here If Dylan isnt a Christian how can he be a convert to Christianity Have you looked over the AfD since you posted on it A lot of additional arguments and counterarguments have been posted You can still change some aspect of your wording or provide some objection to the inclusion of Dylan on that list which I think is clearly objectionable Thanks
