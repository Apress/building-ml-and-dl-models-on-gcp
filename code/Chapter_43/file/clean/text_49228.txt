Sheila Graber
Re your inference that a birthplace requires a citation on Sheila Graber this is quite simply wrong Do you think that Fred Dibnah needs a citation to says hes from Bolton or Paul McCartney to says hes from Liverpool No Please stop inserting citation requirements where they are not needed it reduces the credibility of the site for a casual reader  These tags should be used where there is genuine reason to suspect that the fact is incorrect controversial or blatently fraudulent lawsonrob
