No Original Rangers were called The Rangers Football Club PLC but were registered in the SPL as Rangers FC which is a trading name now owned by Sevco Scotland however Sevco Scotland cant use that name as its still being used by The Originals in the SPL so they have registered The Rangers FC next season they will probably use Rangers FC as The Originals will be dead and no longer able to use it However they might always need to use The Rangers FC as for all I know once a Club uses a name they are then known as that forever
