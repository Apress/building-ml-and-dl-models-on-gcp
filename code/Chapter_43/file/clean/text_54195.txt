Again you have just as much COI as I do youre taking your personal opinions seeking sources to justify your position and ignoring evidence to the contrary some of which is in your very own documents  As you stated yes the CDC only has one page for TGTS people this is because were all in approximately the same risk category MTF or FTM  MSM have different risks from TGTS individuals and education needs to be targeted to each group specially generally only in the top most use condoms way just like women who engage in risky heterosexual sex have specific risks  Dont worry I will ensure that whatever I quote from the CDC will be referable and independently verifiable
