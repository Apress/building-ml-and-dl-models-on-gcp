I tried making some improvements but I left the issue along about the quote from Chase Its a hard one cause he makes clear factual errors in his description of events and I almost want to add an uncited tag on his comments I agree that the quote absolutely cannot be included without clear statements afterwards showing that he was wrong but that is hard to do without looking like youre dragging him through the mud The quotation should not be excluded either because Chases statements are themselves so noteworthy that they need to be included as a follow up to the story of Jensen and evidence of the continued attitude of the group that followed Jensen 

As an aside the newspaper references are very poor It would help to have more details and if possible a link to the entire article Its easy to cherry pick information without the full source If you have copies of them you might want to scan them in    Talk
