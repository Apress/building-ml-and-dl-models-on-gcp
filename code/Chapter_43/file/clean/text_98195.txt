decline5 reverts in a 24 hour period is clearly edit warring  Despite requets to discuss it on the talk page by the other editor I cannot find where you attempted to discuss the edits  The argument he is an edit warrior so I must not be does not count either it takes 2 to edit war  You chose to continue to revert without engaging in discourse an important part of this project  Take this as a cool down period and come back refreshed   Chris Kreider
