Why the revert on the iTunes article 

I know that you might feel that the iTunes Art Importer is unnotable but thats exactly its problem  its not nearly as well known as it should be I discovered it back in the days of iTunes 5 and its served me well since AND through iTunes 7 Its far better than the built in ArtAdder with iTunes 7

I strongly ask of you that my revision be allowed as I hope more people will use it and that it will encourage the author to write a final version of it instead of just the beta copy that Ive been using for quite a while

Thanks
Zach
