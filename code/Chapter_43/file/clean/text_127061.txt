Is this really important 

On the July 14 2008 episode of Raw Marella was defeated by WWE Diva Beth Phoenix in an intergender match after Marella issued an open challenge to the entire Raw roster28 The angle continued the following week after Marella lost to the returning DLo Brown Marella and Phoenix shared a kiss to which both expressed considerable confusion to afterwards

This is nothing more than reporting week to week events and not at all significant unless the angle with Beth turns him and Beth into a Power Couple Until then Im deleting it
