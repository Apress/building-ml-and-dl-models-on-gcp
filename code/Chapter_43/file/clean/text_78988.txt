Im familiar with your site  I owned and operated Bangkokcom from 1997 to 2005  I was among the first Westerners to bring the internet to Thailand    You cant rush in headstrong to an article that the rest of us have been tending for monthsyears and promote your own site with a link  I daresay that the other editors involved with the article would agree with me    Heres what you need to do  You need to go to the Bangkok Talk page and start a new section called CityPhoto and make your case for why your link is appropriate for the article  People involved with the article will either give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down and when a general consensus is reached we can act accordingly  This is the most democratic way to do things and hopefully youll consider it to be fair  OK  Thanks   

Oh one quick thing  Try to sign messages you put on Talk pages including user Talk pages with four tildes  or by using the signature button between the No W and Hyphen buttons at the top of the edit box  Thanks
