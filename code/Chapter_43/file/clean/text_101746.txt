Wade Park 

The whole point is that the park is much more than the museum its more than 10 of a square mile so its a significantly different entity from the museum itself  Because theres no article on the HD we shouldnt have its infobox anywhere at all  Granted we shouldnt have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole but we also shouldnt pretend that another article fills that hole either    

You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article  the park isnt the entire district but you are also partially incorrect Youre saying The park itself is not the district and the National Register database indicates that the park isnt even part of the district  where that I underlined is where youre erring  The NRHP website lists this Roughly bounded by E 105 St East Blvd Chester and Euclid Aves  Cleveland 650 acres 7 buildings 1 structurehttpnrhpfocusnpsgovnatregsearchresultdofullresulttruerecordid339httpwwwnationalregisterofhistoricplacescomohCuyahogadistrictshtml Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites and you havent either spent time in Cleveland or at the very least looked at trhe area in question on the map then youre not taking into account two three things 1 the 650 acres includes Wade Park Google Map it 2 The name Wade Park District explicitly and even implicitly if youre familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland 3 and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland Jeptha Wades property which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from The CMA Botanical Gardens Natural History Museum and Severance Hall which all are part of the district would not be there if Wade Park wasnt set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered its NRHP entry

Lastly given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district We could argue about this ad nauseam But whats the point

Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD including the Wade Park itself Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding it is simply redundant Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense the article is hardly complete and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD and the reason I put it there in the first Either way the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians and moreover as members of Ohiospecific Wikprojects to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative userbased encyclopedia or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information that is an important part of a large US City available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information
