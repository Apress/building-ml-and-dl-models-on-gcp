I think youre splitting too many hairs here  Its very apparent that she and Summer are gonna have some business and its become obvious that shes graduated from from mere manager to a fighting diva  People like Paul Heyman or Zeb Colter or HoganLitaGunn Tough Enough are there in nonphysical roles and are listed as such  Lana has clearly made the jump from that status Personally I think the Other onair personnel list should be strictly for those in nonphysical roles  Once Lana started throwing down with Summer and it became clear that theyre destined for a match then Lana showed that shes above being merely other personnel  UserVjmlhds user talkVjmlhdstalk
