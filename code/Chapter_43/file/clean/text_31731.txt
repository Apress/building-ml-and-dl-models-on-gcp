Bhikkhu Bodhi advert tag 

Hi Demophon 
I see in May you added an advert tag to the WP Bhikkhu Bodhi article  Ive tried to neutralize some of the fluffier phrasing  Ive not included criticisms of Bodhi but solely because I really dont know of any certainly nothing published or widespread  Given these changes would you be against the removal of the advert tag at this time  If not could you identify concrete reasons because frankly I can be pretty thick at TalkBhikkhu BodhiAdvert tag  I very much appreciate your help  With metta  talk
