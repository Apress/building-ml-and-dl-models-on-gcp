I added a comment made by one of the editors in question they had posted on their talkpage with use of the word we and personal knowledge of the situation to say that they had a COI and a COI only without specifics it is still being said its a violation of WPOUTING which I dont understand can you answer my question there and explain it to me If Im off base with the second one I really need to know how if I am not to repeat it in the future the first one I do understand and agree it should be RevDeld but I did make every attempt to make the second something useable to at least say we had a COI using comments from the user made on their talkpage I would appreciate some guidance in this issue if Im off base
