 Canvassing 

Hi KaragouniS you may not have been aware of it but the kind of vote canvassing youve been doing for the football template is rather seriously frowned upon Can I ask you to stop Thanks   
Ah yes just going to say the same thing    talk  

Honestly I have no idea whats going on in the football pages Apparently there have been precedents and some perceived consensus among football editors that only world championship teams should have such templates Nothing I personally care very much about to be honest   

No KaragouniS Greek users should not have been notified before it was put up for deletion  All the other templates of the group are deleted so its clearly ripe for deletion  And to notify all the Greek football users individually means slanting the votes towards keep for that reason  This is an encyclopedia for everyone even when it comes to Greek football templates and the votes should be universal    talk  

I am the third about canvassing the votes Please do not do it again It is divisive and disruptive

 link to defender 

Hello Thank you for your recent edits regarding football players Your edit included one or more links to the page defender which is a disambiguation page This type of page is intended to direct users to more specific topics Ordinarily we try to avoid creating links to disambiguation pages since it is preferable to link directly to the specific topic relevant to the context You can help Wikipedia by revising the links you added to defender to refer directly to the most relevant topic such as defender football by writing out defender footballdefender Regards   

As a typing tip you might also consider using the HelpPipe trick That is type only defender football which will automatically produce the correct defender footballdefender when you press save  Silver
