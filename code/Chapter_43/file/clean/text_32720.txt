Did I vandalized NO Did I insulted anyone NO Am I the only one who thinks the the picture should be removed NO  This means I have just as much right to reedit the pictures You blocking  me though someones request is an violation of wiki users rights Whats the point of going to the talk page if you cant resolve the problem in anything You only solution is resorting in blocking and the END RESULT is nothing has changed I will still report this page to other wiki administrators  talk talk  contribs 703 11 march UTC
