Aah the WikiCop once againnothing better to do with your life than to talk to people like theyre idiots  I deleted a talk section that contained no actual sections and only one line that simply read Buy MLB 10 The Show thats called spam I guess you didnt know that   I also replaced it with actual discussion about the article itself How once would consider that replacing a page with blank content is beyond mebut then again I dont possess the infinite wisdom you do  Perhaps it would benefit you to actually view the changes that were made before flashing your badge
