I dont know if this is good news or bad news but I have decided to call it quits on Wikipedia this time for good  n pril 2007 I pulled out for a few days then changed my account name  I hope that I have made a constructive contribution to Wikipedia  even I have embarrassed myself even being suspended several times and I have bullied some decent editors  even driving them off the site  Tecmobowl probably was the most unique editor I encountered but there were others  I hope that I havent done enough people wrong to jeopardize my chance to go to heaven  Thanks to all of you for what you have done for me over the years  I will stick around until the end of June  Bon voyage
