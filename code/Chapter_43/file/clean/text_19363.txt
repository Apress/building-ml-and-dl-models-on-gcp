Le Grand you are not innnocent So why do you continue to act like the victim here You twisted many of the things around on me I talked with Ran on his talk page about you thats the only case you are right about The other cases you assume collectarian and Judgesurreals talk pages I didnt mention your name once Instantly assuming things isnt helping matters Its clear you havent avoided me either the list of Ring of Honor events AFD which I believe you explained with Im part of the wrestling project is one example Project members arent required to visitpost in AFDs of the projects scope You couldve had restraint there but didnt The fact you come here to harass me during a block is also bad faith in my view In response to McJeffs RFC link he provided see this section WikipediaRequests_for_commentRobJ1981Findings It was found that McJeff was a part of the problem Remember it takes two to have a conflict and the evidence I provided at the RFC shows McJeff isnt innocent either If he ignored more things it would be a different story But for the most part McJeff harassed me and egged me on to get a reaction out of me Also Le Grands repost of ANI comments here isnt productive in my view People can see the ANI post clearly so theres no need to be redundant
