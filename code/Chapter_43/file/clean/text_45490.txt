The NYT article at the article on him does not state gold medal anywhere  There was no medial awarded As such I removed the misleading mention of gold medal
Please leave the Outside Magazine article quote and source and section revealing his use of a prescription steroid for an Everest speedclimb
The source httpwwweverest1953couk that you keep removing is a well known Everest history and Everest news website run by Collin Wallace of England  Most websites are published by one person eg ExplorersWeb is published by one person Tina Sjogren  So its selfpublished as well
