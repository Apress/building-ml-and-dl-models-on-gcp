Dear Heresiarchess  I was wondering where that fantastic gobbledegook was coming from How stupid of me not to have thought of you as the author of that brilliant piece of logic that so fiercely reminds of Alice in Blunderland Is Barnesen a Protestant He says no he submitted formally to the Pope but you with your Infallible SuperMagisterium know something that only God could possibly know  that Biarnesen is according to your ineffable Omniscience a cryptoheretic And then the further wonderlogic that because a mans a Protestant hes incapable of receiving and conveying valid orders Obviously you have been given a SuperMandate over and above that given to Peter and his successors by which you have nullified all of Catholic theology and teaching that do not conform to your own looneybin Procrustean constraints But you must excuse me I will never turn back to your god Moloch I will stick around with the God of Israel against the High Priestess of Core and Dathan  LJM 115249115244
