Yes Jdvelasc its a little hard to figure out what your objection actually is here  If this sentence is not a formalization of what its asserted to be a formalization of then there just is no such thing as a formalization in firstorder logic  No firstorder sentence can fix its interpretation
Your original claim is that x cant be a natural number due to the soundness theorem  But thats not so  the soundness theorem says only that there is really no such natural number x  It does not refute the possibility that the theory T happens to prove that there is such a natural number  T may prove false things and if its omegainconsistent must prove false things  The soundness theorem does not refute that because the soundness theorem applies only if all the axioms are true and some of the axioms of T may in fact in this case must be false
