Blocking and sockpuppets

Okay yes I DID vandalize the RD Reynolds article Twice But I am not a sockpuppet of anyone I could understand blocking because of vandalism sure but because of sockpuppetry Who is this peripirus or whoever person who did this Surely that is abuse of blocking power Also this DX97 is quite clearly a vandal himher self Again if I have been blocked because and only because I vandalized an article I can accept that But this sockpuppet stuff is unfounded Could these two people the blocker and the one who tagged me actually state their case without just being smug and rash
