It is indeed haha Thats how you say Archaeogod good sir I had to selfout because of that awesome cover and also some academic work being done involving Tel Kabri For the most part they do have something of a language requirement in the US because when you have archaeology departments outside of anthro departs theyre typically rolled into or heavily associated with classics This has actually been the topic of conversation on several pub trips an essential element in archaeology Thankfully its never too late to dig though so age isnt a factor in the actual process of digging  Say Shalom 11 Tevet 5774
