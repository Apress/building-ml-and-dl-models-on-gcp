WPNSPORT 

Hello I agree that there is a double standard with respect to some sports Please note that this is not intentional and why editing the sports sections must occur Gaelic games has only been written by a single author I have no clue what makes someone notable in that sport If you are familiar with that sport I suggest editing that section so that it is more consistent with the rest of the document Personally I think bringing this essay to guideline is actually a good idea because it will get more people to edit the document
