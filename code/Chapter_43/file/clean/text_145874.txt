This edit is just the readdition of material that was removed earlier  What about removing the ages of subjects is that not POV  And Wily what were worried about here is how the article reads not the history of the edits  If editing a certain section of an article is POV then Wikipedia should just shut down since every edit would be POV 20812417534
