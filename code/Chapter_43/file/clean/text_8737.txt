Hello Gerardw If you click on Forsenas contribution list and review the edit summaries it is hard to believe that hes patiently seeking consensus on Kosovo matters For instance Removing data from albanian extermist vandal member Angelo De La Paz In particular look at this edit of Battle of Kosovo where Forsena goes against all the cited references and actually removes most of them On the matter of disputed country versus disputed region if Angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first it would be worrisome Though your point about the Balkan topic ban is noted since Forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced it is too soon to give him credit for following it The announcement that he was under Digwuren restrictions on 7 January seems to have had no effect at all on his edits I will leave Angelo a note that his editing was discussed here
