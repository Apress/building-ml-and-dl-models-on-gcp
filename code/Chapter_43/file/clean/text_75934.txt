My own guess would be that it is a religious reference that the three wise men referred to are the Father Son and the Holy Ghost

You have to go to Don McLeans American Pie for this
 
and the three men I admire most the Father Son and the Holy Ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died and they were singing 

The wise men come down from heaven Blunt Having caught the last train for the coast McLean those three men buy a semi by the sea Blunt 

On this basis this song may be a general rant against human nature mankind having mainly turned their backs on God 

On earth the wise men Father Son and Holy Ghost cant escape from bad human beings and are actually sorry to have created mankind in the first place mankind generally being pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress  Who just judge each other and try to impress 

God only made man because he was trying to have some fun but he made a mess of the product ie human nature is imperfect and now he cant escape from mankind cant be free from mankind And has no way out of the problem that mankind is and the imperfect creation God has made on earth So God takes refuge from us on the coast
 
As individuals and as the human race collectively if we proceed in a godless way we have to ask ourselves the question Where are we now 

Blunt isnt alone however as he himself has God 

Only my guess Pure speculation Probably well wide of the mark I suppose someone else will tell me
