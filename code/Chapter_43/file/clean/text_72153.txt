Republic RC3 Seabee
Hi Niteshift Thank you for your interest in my Republic RC3 Seabee section of Aircraft in fiction  I am interested in any ideas and suggestions you or others may have  Sorry I didnt realize anyone wanted to discuss my work when I first submitted the Seabee piece recently  Im new to this type of editing and discussion  I have since tried to made significant changes to the original piece and find the best footnotes I could  I find writing for Wikipedia pages very challenging but interesting  I will check in with your page again over the weekend  Looking forward to hearing from you  Thanks
