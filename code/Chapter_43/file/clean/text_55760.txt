Excuse me but could you explain this statement please The person who removed the link persists in mixing up the link to the performances and the link to the specific edition which was also removed but on a different wikipedia page

Which Wikipedia page  And exactly how do you know this Again I ask are you somehow connected to the publisher of this edition  Why is this so important to you
