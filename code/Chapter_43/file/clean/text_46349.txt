Does make sense 

Have a look at WPUSERNAME The block was for two reasons  one was a name that appeared to represent an organisation Wikipedia accounts are for individuals and not for groups and the other was advertising See WPSPAM Thats what I do when the two things come together Theres a softer block for having the wrong name but editing reasonably well  that just usually requires a change of name or even just a new account not mentioning the company or knitting circle or whatever it was If theres spam from a username that passes USERNAME they get a caution from me if it looks deliberate Theres two more levels and after Level 4 theres usually a Spam Only block Most of these are just trying it on and give up after the first attempt to plug their corner florists and martial arts gym or whatever The bag sellers and fake Rolex pushers are professional spammers and get no mercy OK Any more questions you can ask on my talk page If Im not around theres quite a lot who stalk it and usually sometimes give better answers than I do
