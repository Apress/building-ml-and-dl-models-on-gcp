I was just reading through the very intelligent commentary here and it occurred to me  why dont we arrange by decade I mean we would of course be starting out with the Fleming and progress by author and film in chronological order  The benefit of this is that we can map the characters evolution with cited commentary from each of the actors portraying the character and subsequent written treatments So long as we focus on how real people wroteportrayed Bond wed avoid any inuniverse issues
This would seem a nice middle ground and has the added benefit of  once we are all done with it  having the only real sections undergoing ongoing editing would eventually be the more current decades and not the whole history Thoughts
