Please take a break
I have been reading this snafu  You are doing yourself no favors please take a break    
I just want to work on improving and creating articles etc  Yes defending myself is a laborious activity but to hear exaggerations and hypocrisy thrown at me in an effort to demonize me for expulsion to protect the encyclopedia is hard to stay away from the overall nature of said activity is WPBAITing and things like the CfD and the hostile RM closures is AGFNPA in the extreme who should take a break is the choruscadre whose primary activity on Wikipedia seems to be attacking contributing editors by any specious and POVAGF rationale available I know Im not alone in being attacked and vilified this way and yes theres far more productive things to be doing than arguing with people who only want to argue
