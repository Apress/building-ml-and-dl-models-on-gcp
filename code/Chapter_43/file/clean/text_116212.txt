You did not address my argument If I created a religion called Wikipedia Judaism where people worship the sun would that be included in the Judaism page as well Simply because something is suffixed with the name Judaism means that they are truly related to eachother Orthodox Jews do not even consider Conservative or Reformed conversions valid and therefor consider most Reformed Jews to infact be nonJews That said why do they share the same page If Christianity was called Christian Judaism which it essentially is would that be included as well
