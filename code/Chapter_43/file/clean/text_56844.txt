The FIDESZMPP are nationalists and very likely ultranationalists Why First of all a number of mass media articles and other coverage both domestic Hungarian and foreign have concluded based on their actions statements rallies and their own admission that they are nationalists or ultranationalists Something I witnessed in Budapest during the elections in 2002 FIDESZMPSZ the part after the hyphen has changed over and over told their voters most of whom do not deny being nationalists to wear the national colors pin or cocard and carry Hungarian flags during the elections at all times if possible to show that they are true patriotic Hungarians unlike the MSZP and their junior SZDSZ who acccording to FIDESZ are traitors of the nation Of the total Hungarian voting population at least 50 of them favor MSZP SZDSZ and an assortium of other progressive parties or the relatively moderate MDF In fact Mrs Ibolya David head of the MDF Magyar Demokrata Forum broke up with Mr Viktor Orban and have since been bitter rivals for the affections of the rightwing voters Anyway I will not put the term nationalists or ultranationalists myself since I was the first to notice the ommission but I strongly suggest it should be done for historic accuracys sake FIDESZMPP are more like Austrian Jorg Haiders Freedom Party than Wolfgang Schussels Conservative Party Ultimately anyone concerned can contact Amnesty International or French Conservative party Chirac will no longer take Orbans callswonder whyand Angela Merkel of Germany would not come to Hungary to show up for Viktor during the 2006 Spring electionshmmm
