Aright well let me ask you a question then If I had said leave me alone would have that been taken as an attack And as you already read the first attack was out of unawareness of EVERY wikipedia policy honestly do you know how long it would take to read them all And ignorance think about that word for a minute Is calling a user ignorant when they post a comment like this Even though mediterranean people are commonly Latino anyway a personal attack I dont know why dont you go ask the members of WikipediaWikiProject Latinos or any one of the wikipedians belonging to the CategoryLatinoHispanic Wikipedians Once you have done that get back to me please
