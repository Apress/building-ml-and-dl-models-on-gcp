In comedy 

Deleted the In Comedy section it adds nothing to an understanding of Jack Ruby and distracts from the rest of the article Any significant influence by Ruby upon comedy could be placed in the Popular Culture section any Rubyrelated jokes are gratuitous at best   

 In the popular culture section NOFX reference 

I dont think the reference to the NOFX song The Man I Killed being about Jack Ruby is correct From what Ive read and my interpretation of the song it is about someone perhaps Fat Mike the lead singer killing a world leader most likely George W Bush Unless a good reference can be found to support the claim I dont think it is appropriate to have this claim listed under the Popular Culture section I am going to remove it for the time being  
 

 NixonRuby connection  
A number of sources claim that there was some sort of connection between Jack Ruby and Richard Nixon    Even if this is all conspiracy nonsense it should be somehow addressed in this article so people looking for information on the connection can get the truth and wont continue on to some other less reliable source

Ive seen a physical piece of paper which of course I couldnt yet scan at the National Archives in the 70s My father was a good friend of E Raymond Lewis Librarian of the House of Representative IIRC and I would hang out talking to whomever while they met Rubenstein had been subpeonaed by McCarthys Subcommitee on Investigations Nixon sent a note which is what I saw saying that Ruby had been working for him in a confidential capacity and it would be unacceptable to question him in public I forget the exact wording the subpoena was revoked I think the paper might have been in the congressional record

See WPNOR crank   

 Ive got a xerox copy of that document and it has a zip code on the FBI letterhead  Thats a bit of a problem since there were no zip codes when it was supposedly was written  Its actually widely admitted to be a forgery  John McAdams

 A case has been made for explaining the ZIP code  that the onepage xerox is really a composite of 2 different documents The top on FBI letterhead is a halfpage undated typed note NOTE Extra copy Inclosure not verified by official report Return to file This is sensitive used as a transmittal sheet stapled on top of full page underneath Only the bottom half of the full sheet dated 1947 is seen  If this is correct the presence of the ZIP code on the letterhead need not affect the dating of the bottom half See discussion here  

First let me say I dont know how to add new sections on Wiki or Wiki Talk pages so Im putting this here even though its not related to Nixon Its related to JFKs VP Lyndon B Johnson Im absolutely speechless after looking through this article that Johnsons name isnt mentioned anywhere considering he WAS Kennedys running mate and theres a very famous picture of Johnson smiling at a man off in the crowd who is winking back to Johnson as if theyre sharing some secret joke while Johnson has his hand on a bible and is being sworn in And I think its a very possible motive for having JFK assassinated he would and did advance to the presidency upon JFKs assassination

Something else I found that I stumbled across using StumbleUponcom was that according to the articles i read which were full of hotlinks to other information around the web according to that author all 4 presidents whod been assassinated were assassinated because they opposed central banking or artificial banking not sure what the proper term would be that is the fact that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned corporation which prints money for a fraction of the cost of the face values of what they print Something to think about

Ill go look through my stumbleupon history to see if I can find the article Im talking about in the previous paragraph but there are quotes by Lincoln and Kennedy talking about how they were against the Federal Reserve for lack of a better term Im not sure what it was called historically I doubt it was always call
