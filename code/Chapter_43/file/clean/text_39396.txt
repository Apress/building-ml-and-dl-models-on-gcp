Its truly disturbing that such a slimy disingenguous troll is allowed free rein here without sanction and the apparent support of the administrative section You KNOW that Freeman was a far greater expert on Samoa as he is universally described by the secondary sources But you are looking for any tenuous excuse to belittle his authority because you are so transparently biased and dishonest Yes his dissertation was on Borneo does that preclude him from being an expert in anything else As you KNOW it doesnt Boas dissertation was on the color of water should I write Franz Boas whose own research was on the color of water everytime he is introduced in an anthropological dispute to discredit him PLEASE STOP WASTING MY TIME WITH LAME SOPHISTRY BIAS AND DISHONESTY Thank you
