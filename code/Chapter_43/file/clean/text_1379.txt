Im back I already created  ID occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class C when I do I collected a massive number of diff edits on Balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is  on record getting blocked for saying this about Greeks under a previous handle not to mention his personal talk page is one big antiGreek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles

No Assfuckers has a nice ring to it D use it as a pejorative term 

I was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin Futper and a few others eg Macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antiGreek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking  Im going to avoid escalating this further for now ns 

As for the current naming disputing article I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I dont think that reduces the existential threat to Greece Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic Athenians and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left 

There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasnt Greek I didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didnt think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course

February 26 1992 The FYROMs President Kirov Gligorov at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report Easten Europe stated We are Slavs who came to the region in the sixth century We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians

January 22 1999 The FYROMs Ambassador in Washington DC Mrs Ljubica Acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans she stated We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language Greece is The FYROMs second largest trading partner and its number one investor

February 24 1999 The FYROMs Ambassador to Canada Gyordan Veselinov in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen he admitted We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian There is some confusion about our identity

I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior He directly contradicts FYROMs own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names in order to get recognition

Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan who claims to be related to Alexander the Great then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians and dont get me started on that incident where Gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of United Macedonia was clearly present which also seems to be missing from the existing article
