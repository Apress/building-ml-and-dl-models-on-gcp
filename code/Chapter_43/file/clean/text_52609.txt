ah OK  If you ever want to approach FAC I can give you a long list most importantly the External link farm should be seriously pruned per WPEL WPNOT inline citations would need improvement and footnotes should be formatted per WPCITEES Cultural influence is listy the text between split images in the lead would be a problem and there are some WPMSH issues  Its probably GA quality though  none of those are particularly GA issues  GA is seriously backed up by the way and it can take up to a month to get someone to look at the article I dont participate in GA as I think its a large waste of time   Talk
