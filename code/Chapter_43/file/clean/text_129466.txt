Interaction ban 

You are the one who posted this Does that make you the admin who imposed the ban or would it be someone else Im asking because Im curious what the proper mechanism is if any for reporting possible violations of interaction bans I asked at AN and they told me to ask the admin who imposed the ban  Whats up Doc carrots 
By my recollection that rfc was reclosed by someone else Apparently when they reverted the closure I had done they neglected to place their own name on that page you linked to
Regardless afaik there is no restriction that places one admin solely as responsible for enforcing any user sanctions And afaik thats part of  what WPAN is used for After all There is always another admin  Feel free to link to this response on WPAN at your discretion   
They basically sent me your way so Im just going to let it simmer on the back burner for a while longer  Whats up Doc carrots 

 Baseball 

As a fan of baseball I thought you might be interested in this link that I ran across  talk 
Awesome Of course the nature of the game has changed The current records for saves were never approached by the oldtimers And thats the other side of the same coin  Whats up Doc carrots 

 Richard III  

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lourd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures 
Grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
And now instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
I that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph 
I that am curtaild of this fair proportion 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
Deformed unfinishd sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover 
To entertain these fair wellspoken days
I am determined to prove a villain

Richard II

This royal throne of kings this scepterd isle
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars 
This other Eden demiparadise 
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war 
This happy breed of men this little world 
This precious stone set in the silver sea 
Which serves it in the office of a wall 
Or as a moat defensive to a house
Against the envy of less happier lands 
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England 
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings 
Feard by their breed and famous by their birth 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home
For Christian service and true chivalry 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry 
Of the worlds ransom blessed Marys Son 
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land 
Dear for her reputation through the world
Is now leased out I die pronouncing it 
Like to a tenement or pelting farm
