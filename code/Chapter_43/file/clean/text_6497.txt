Disambiguation Page

Does this need a disambiguation page I would argue that the other Billy West is not prominent enough to cause confusion There is not even any article linked for him and the Primrose article is pretty minor 
First I moved this to the bottom of the page because thats where people usually expect new material to be This way people looking will be more likely to see this question no biggie To answer your question no I dont think this really needs a disambiguation page for the same reasons that you listed
