The problem with this disambig is Michael that it links to events in history that barely can be called a Polish invasion on Russia  for instance as there was no Russia in today meaning of the word  and they show rather a Russian Ghirlandajos POV Without any disclamer term used in Russian historiography a reader can think we claim that they were Polish invasions on Russia what is not exactly my view  Thats the main problem and Ghirlandajos insults and his weak explanations afterwards that he was understood wrongly yeah right only make finding a good solution more difficult Best  Î´
