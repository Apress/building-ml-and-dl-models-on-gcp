I think were going to need to have some wider discussion about this because this seems to me like its about bigots getting crafty and exploiting the rules  Im not Jewish but I do use the internet and so I am unfortunately more familiar with the Zionist Banker Jew Communist conspiracy theories than I would like to be It is absolutely not ok for someone to create a page called Jews and Communism whose primary purpose seems to be to advance the idea that Jews dominate communist movements Ive never accused anyone of antiSemitism on Wikipedia before so I have no idea how else you talk about patent antiSemitism than to call it what it is  care to comment
