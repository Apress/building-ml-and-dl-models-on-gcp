The picture of Kate Winslet

Putting a picture of Kate Winslet on this article gives a deeply misleading impression A reader could be forgiven for thinking that she has an important connection with the subject matter when really she has little or nothing to do with it  she just happened to play a very minor role in a film adaptation of the novel Ideally it would be nice to replace the picture of Winslet with a more appropriate one but since I dont have one Ill just go shead and delete
