Sixteenth Ammendment 
Hi The reason I changed this is because I searched for 16th ammendment and did not find the article I believe that I saw the 25th ammendment article written as the number not spelled out as well as one other ammendment I think it makes more sense for all of those articles of be titles with the number rather than spelled out People usually do not write by spelling out the word if it is a number Sorry if I changed that one while leaving the other ones the same If it is changed back I wont change it back I just thought it was a better title Thanks for the message
