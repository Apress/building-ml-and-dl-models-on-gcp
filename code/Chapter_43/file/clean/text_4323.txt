Hmmmm are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing if so what do you recommend
My understanding is that it was Constantinoples position that Rome objected to which granted was at the core of Justinians pentarchy but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole Even so though its not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time In other words it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements some of which led to temporary schisms but to my understanding Justinians system even if not everybody liked it became a practical reality one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away
