To all of you who think this can not be true 

I live in Sweden My sister was locked up against her will in a similar institution here in Sweden but run by the municipality when she got her first child without being married And the bureaucrats tried to take her child In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth Their only crime being that they got a child without being married the father of the child being absent and not protecting the woman and the woman not having a family that could protect her 

When my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her The bureaucrats clearly had not realised that my sister had a big family that could protect her After that the bureaucrats attacked us by all legal and illegal means at their disposal We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack And this happened as recently as 19992000

Why the bureaucrats do these things I dont know Perhaps there is black money to get in the adoption business or they simply do it so they have something to do so their department wont get downsized The scary thing is that this is an ongoing thing defenceless women but good mothers are still being locked up and get their babies taken like that in Sweden
