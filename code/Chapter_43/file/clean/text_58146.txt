Apparently no one else thinks the templates are correct there either because no one has readded them even after you asked for comments from other editors
 Do you think that the cleanup tag is inappropriate 
Your remark about my behavior being transparently puerile is a personal attack and your refusal to assume good faith on my part is bizarre Its impossible to work collaboratively with someone who thinks hes never wrong and insults people he disagrees with Im sorry if my try at starting a productive discussion with you was fruitless Id hoped that we would be able to work collaboratively because I do agree with most of your edits Its unfortunate that you cant agree with any of mine
