I was able to post the above list so quickly because I already had it in a text file in my hard drive  Ive been meaning to get around to updating the sound list for some time now 
As far as generating interest  Ive spent four years trying to drum up more interest in freely licensed full length classical music Unfortunately my attempts failed  Im still effectively the only one who does it The classical music wikiproject was not interested Wikipedia_talkWikiProject_Classical_musicArchive_5Need_help21Wikipedia_talkWikiProject_MusicArchive_3I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talkWikiProject_MusicArchive_2Raulbot2C_and_the_music_list So I really had given up trying to interest others  
The sound list was featured on digg a while back  httpdiggcommusicWikipedia_has_free_classical_music_downloads  It got 1600 diggs which is IMO very impressive
