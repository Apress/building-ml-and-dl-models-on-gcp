Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger
I reverted your edit because you just destroyed the continuity of that section 

As for your claims I dont see any standardstemplates set for what a players season recap should include I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information and certaintly not enough for individual players I think those articles are poorly done and Im not interested in improving them I do not like the prosestyle recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of In week X of the XXXX season Player X did this and that against Team X in a XXXX winloss For the longest time thats how Drew Brees 2009 season a great individual season that deserves better writing read It still has some of those problems 

The way Ive done it gives it structure You dont have to repeat who the opponent was what week it was or the result And these are NFL players Theyll play 16 games a year 20 at the most with the playoffs Im not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games Its a small sample Write a sentence or two for each game and youre talking 1640 sentences at the most Hardly creates a long section

I really suggest you look at Denard Robinson Michigan QB and his current season recap He has subsections with lots of text for each individual game this year And you know what I dont see anyone changing it or complaining about it It doesnt bother me While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players so dont get worried I have to say their info is written pretty well and its sourced and everything That much info on one game is pretty crazy but you know what where are the restrictions on space

Come on man this is the internet Were not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia The space is there Ill make sure to refrain from any further mention of teamoriented things like going on a bye week but other than that the text has been about Ben so its on topic and referenced I dont see the big deal and I cant say Im seeing other people questioning it besides yourself I didnt even start Mannings 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today Looks fine to me And since theres been free reign given on these kind of sections again I dont see the problem
