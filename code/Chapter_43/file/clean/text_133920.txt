Forumula1net as an External Link 

I would like to throw this subject to the floor for consideration

The site has been included within the external links section by a number of different users over the past year and I feel there should be a final decision on whether or not it should have a place on the page

For

The site is independent not overly monetized by design no popups or intrusive banners provides unique daily news and features and supports an informed community

Against

Its not the largest F1 site on the internet nor is it well known The site does not have a pictures contract

I personally believe its independence and lack of commercial nature offers something different and unique over the other external links and probably deserves to be included However what are everyone elses thoughts on this
