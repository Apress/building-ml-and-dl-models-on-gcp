If I might butt in here speaking as a newer admin you are both sort of correct In the case of AFDs the closing admin is expected to analyze the debate and either keep or delete the article based on its content Speedy deletions however can be carried out by an admin without any community input This is because speedy deletions are only for unequivocal cases where there is no need for a debate The point is these supposed privileges come with a lot of extra baggage Admins need to carefully consider the consequences of their admin actions before making them Even if they make the right decision they often have to deal with angry users who are upset because they believe the admin acted incorrectly That is why we have WPRFA to weed out those individuals that lack the judgement restraint and policy knowledge needed to wield the extra tools
