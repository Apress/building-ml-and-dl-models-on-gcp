New user 

Hello Apologies for bringing more trouble to your page but Im at a bit of a loss about what to do I have met and helped a new user at the Teahouse He is writing lots of articles but have so far not interacted much with other editors He is very sure of himself and insist he knows English and editing which is not really the case I have tried to suggest that he get some help from copy editors and others but no luck Should I just leave it be or should I do something else It is really a shame since he seems very capable and the articles are not bad I just think it would be better if he learned to edit properly before creating more articles Suggestions My suggestion to him his reply Best Talk
