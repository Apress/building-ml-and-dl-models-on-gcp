request for mediation made

hi slim  heres a copy of my initial complaint in case u havent already seen it by stalking my edits 

Im being subject to harassment by two administrators UserSlimvirgin and UserJayjg among other users who object to my editing and are trying to drive me off the Wikipedia with persistent interference factitious objections and POV censorship After trying and failing to set me up under 3RR they are now accusing me of disruption and threatening me with a ban because I have objected to their harassment Among their complaints is that I have been uncivil An example of Slims own standards of civility can be seen on my User talkJamaissur she stalked my editing until she found a chance to make an aggressive and uncivil objection to it apparently not feeling obliged to follow the same rules as she applies to others I have little hope that a complaint about administrators will be successful but here is one anyway

and dont worry  advances in brain modification and control will soon mean that ppl like me can be prevented from even having heretical thoughts a brave new world dawns and ure 1 of its shining heralds
