Threats
I would appreciate it if you would not threaten me with blocking  If someone accidentally changes an article slightly and puts wrong information it is automatically assumed that it is an act of vandalism  I often try to refrain from editing due to people like you who assume the worst  I see here that there are many similar complaints against you  I would highly advise checking with the user before jumping to accusations
