Hi  1 I mustve mistakenly thought Ian was an original member bc hes always viewed as the bands definitive axeman  2 Yeah I almost bought an Akai Headrush looper a few years ago because of its notorious role in Don Cabs oneguitarist recordings  I settled on a Boss Loop Station instead rather than a Headrush or Boomerang due to those twos reliability  price issues respectively Check out Hovercraft Southpacific  Auburn Lull if youre into this kind of hallucinitory guitar looping  I thought Don Cabs new lineup was incredible when I saw them in 04 but I skipped their classic lineup in 98 so I cant compare the two performancewise  Best  0654 3 May
