The publication The Chamcha Age  An Era of Stooges written by Kanshi Ram is not copyrighted unless someone seems to have copyrighted it after his death Kanshi Ram was editor of a publication The Oppressed Indian issues of which of the late 70s and early 80s I have read I have also had the opportunity to witness him addressing gatherings on quite a few occasions I felt that the content at the moment is drawn mostly from media reports that dont objectively represent this individual and his struggle for the emancipation of the downtrodden masses in India Therefore it should be okay to retain the first paragraph that is compiled from text on About the Author from The Chamcha Age At present in web space bspindiaorg appears to be close in terms of being authentic in representing the views of the Bahujan Samaj Party a political party founded by Kanshi Ram Although this site claims copyright over the contents it doesnt formally acknowledge the source from which it has drawn content that is available without copyright I wouldnt mind writing to the webmasterbspindiaorg to get permission for use of content on their site for reproduction on wikipedia 

Secondly I can modify the article appropriately so that content from bspindiaorg and other sources is only used as a source of information instead of article content

I feel strongly that the page on Kanshi Ram needs to be changed appropriately so that the reader will get a proper perspective on his life and mission in ushering political change in modern India
