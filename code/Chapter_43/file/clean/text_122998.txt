Hopeless How can Ryulong have the nerve to meddle in linguistic topics without knowing linguistics at all Considering his antiintellectual attitude combined with 100pagesperday edits I cannot imagine how tremendous damage he has done to Wikipedia
First of all he must learn the difference between phonology and phonetics Thats a minimum requirement to join the discussion Everyone in the field knows the distinction
Showing that Ryulongs accusation against me is groundless is as easy as pie Just check John R Bentleys A Linguistic History of the Forgotten Islands 2008 for example You can find the spellings I used above
The real problem is that the book is a serious linguistic work If Ryulong reads it without even knowing the distinction between phonology and phonetics he will taint Wikipedia with another bunch of errors
