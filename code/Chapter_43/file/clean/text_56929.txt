Thanks Tim I think that the only thing we can do with a persistently subdisruptive editor hey look I coined a phrase without a major shift in wikipolicy is for each of us to keep on top of him patiently and kindly nudging him in the right direction and calling in others when our patience wears thin If his collaborative skills improve in time fantastic if he persists in his behavior however then well be in a better position to reconsider our approach Unless anybody has any better ideas  Soul
