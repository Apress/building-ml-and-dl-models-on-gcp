I never said that I was against adding more massacres comitted by Turks you have too much prejudice Everyone is free to improve the Byzantine massacre article But we should not claim every source that we WPJDLI to be dubious or unreliable You have yourself added extra info about massacres against Greeks in Ayvalik Smyrna and Akhisar in the list of massacres in Turkey If you would find more you would happily add more but nobody accused you of wppov when you did this
The massacres in Turkey article was completely lacking info about massacres comitted by Greeks against Turks which happened numerous times in this war  So I rightfully added these ignored events and you claim that I am pov and you want to remove them all It is clear to everyone what is happening here
