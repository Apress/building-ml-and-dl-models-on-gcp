I do not wish to start WPs equivalent of a Witch Hunt by alleging socketpuppetry but please would someone inform me what is the correct forummechanism for airing my belief that Brixton Busters is not really a new editor entitled to a certain degree of latitude and a greater degree of assuming good faith but has instead recently edited on English Wikipedia using a user account not called Brixton Busters

Sure users may have a right to vanish  but do they have a right to then reappear and continue their old biassed editing agenda while their mates attempt to pull the wool over peoples eyes by alleging that the reappeared editor is a new editor
