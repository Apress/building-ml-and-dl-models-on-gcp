Disagree It specifically goes to Youngs point in the subsequent paragraph and hence is highly relevant to the current controversy and a point of contest between the two sides The quotation is therefore both relevant and interesting as well as being illustrative of Darbys point btw it occurs to me that we have no information about procirc organisations and their activities The only one I know of is the Gilgal Society and I dont know much about it But in the interests of balance we should say something about these if reliable and nonpseudonomous sources can be found I thought you might have a better idea than me
