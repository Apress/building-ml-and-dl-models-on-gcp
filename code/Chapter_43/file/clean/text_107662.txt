Inverted Ad Hominen is nonnotable 

When I correct the ad hominem article later Im zapping the inverted ad hominem term  It is completely nonnotable 86 hits in google and was invented and inserted into the article by UserLayman  Heck the article itself even attributes it to Layman a random web user as having said it

Original edit inserting it under an ip address
Edit by UserLayman the same day

Theres a reason why the term wasnt invented by logicians too because inverted ad hominem is still ad hominem  Theres no inverse about it  The socalled inverse ad hominem is just a case of ad hominem where someone says my qualifications are better than yours instead of directly saying your qualifications suck  The meaning is the same and there is no reason for another term

I really dont think there is any question that this and the silly thing about it being coined should be removed
