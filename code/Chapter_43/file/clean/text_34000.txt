MBT3000 engine power and numbers 

Ive edited the MBT3000s engine power

Im not sure why but english sources have the engine power rated at 1300HP when the chinese reference have them at 1200HPhttpwwwguanchacnmilitaryaffairs2014_12_05_302564_sshtml As an export tank it would be more likely that the numbers are overstated than understated Hence I think the 1200HP is more reliable

The source is an interview with a Norinco designer and he rattles off some numbers If anybody here would be an expert and determine their reliability I would be glad to include them

Frontal with ERA 700mm RHAe

APDS penetration 700mm 1000mm with advanced penetrator
