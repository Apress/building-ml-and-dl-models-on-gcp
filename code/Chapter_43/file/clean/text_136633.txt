I dare you to delete this for the eighth time Protect yourself 

I have made several contributions to wikipedia in the last few minutes and it is sad that on such an open source project I am being attacked and not allowed to post any new information on several pages I think the deletion of my entries is baseless and as you can see here my writing is neither incoherent nor pejorative Please describe to me immediately the reasons you have taken such actions or I will have no choice but to report you to the Wikipedia authourities
