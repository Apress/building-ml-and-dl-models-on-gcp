Hospitals in Japan already implement the therapy and have had sweeping success 

Do tell how it accurately describes its dangers when you have testimony after testimony after testimony Oh wait let me answer that for you bigot Oh well uhhh you know cancer cures itself sometimes or it was a misdiagnosis Is that what you tell yourself at night I think its glaringly apparent youre willfully biased and uninterested in the facts The fact of the matter is Gerson Therapy hashad been implemented time and time again if the treatment were ineffective do tell why do thousands of testimonies exist Magic Oh wait let me answer that again well uhh you see it was a misdiagnosis Dont worry I got your back

When you can discontinue from being a closedminded bigot feel free to come back with something of substance that isnt blatantly biased in the favor of drugs which do nothing for human health

 Beyond uneducated and biased wiki page 

The therapy is both ineffective and dangerous

First of all I believe the writer of this page needs to look into people such as John Christopher Richard Schulze and Bernard Jensen Following your research you need to look into Hippocrates Health Institute These men and that institution implements many dynamics of Gerson Therapy and all have had wildly impressive results with numerous testimonies

The supporting sources make vague allusions to inconclusive results simply because no largescale studies have been conducted 

There is very little scientific evidence to support the use of other components of the Gerson regimen
There have been no wellcontrolled studies published in the available medical literature that show the Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer

As per the very site you source The fact of the matter is Gerson Therapy and its many dynamics have been in use by a multitude of other alternative health practitioners and institutions all the while having more success than our modern cancer treatment  Â Preceding unsigned comment added by 2602306CC6DB1402DF8E1A56C821D53
