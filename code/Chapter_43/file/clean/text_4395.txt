About my deletion requests 

Hello Schutz First of all I should introduce myself I am pl sysop de simple fr nl and commonsuserodder sysop On en wiki Idont have this username because of it was taken by I guess one of my opponents So simply write to my odder 
Second I think that these redirects are simply stupid and not linked from the main space too Why The good redirect is redirecting from the shorter to longer article name not from the longer to shorter I dont know any person that will be writing the longer article name if heshe can write the shorter one Dont forget that Wikipedia is for readers not for writers  
Best regards
