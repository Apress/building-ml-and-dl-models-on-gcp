Ants evolved as a statement of fact 

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article
Ants evolved from wasplike ancestors in the midCretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants
Also perhaps this statement should begin with the words Many experts believe or Evidence suggests etc etc rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact  Preceding unsigned comment added by 62614918   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that havent been statistically proven which points out several flaws in the statement  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps but them first appearing the the midCretaceous period is hard to statistically prove  I suppose this should be changed if Im right but I may not be   talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence   
Very true   talk

where do ants mate
how long do they live
do they have sex  Preceding unsigned comment added by 717207156   

heh viable question  This spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and I did some rewriting  It should be doublechecked for good measure  The article answers these well enough  Ants live varied amounts of time depending on many things  Some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years   talk 

 Common ants varieties 

There is almost no mention of Little Black Ants or Red Ants in this article I see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them
Im not sure where you are but if its Europe then those guys are probably Lasius niger and Myrmica rubra They arent common everywhere UserSeanhoyland
