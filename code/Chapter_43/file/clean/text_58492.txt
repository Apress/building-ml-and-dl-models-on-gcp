All wikipedia content requires a valid citation  There is no validity in the common sense claim because things dont always follow common sense  All of the tubes listed in the paragraph claiming low output were specifically designed to give rasonable output at low voltages  One the 35L6 is capable of managing 15 watts with a plate voltage of just 35 volts when the bias is properly adjusted  Oddly and because of the tetrode characteristics it actually rises to 25 watts at 25 volts  You cannot claim that is significantly lower than it maximum rated output of 3 watts  None of the tubes listed will turn in less than 15 watts at 32 volts Article ammended accordingly
