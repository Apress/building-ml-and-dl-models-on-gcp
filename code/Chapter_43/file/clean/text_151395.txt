Im glad that Hugo has admitted that Im being competent in getting Xerographica unblocked  which is my goal  Right now its actually Hugo whos doing the most damage to that with his wild accusations  Im also glad that he has proven by his very link above that I did not call him a jerk nor have I called him a liar  Srich and Arthur  I highly suggest that you 2 disengage from Xerographica  indeed I would expect that any unblock conditions would include some form of interaction ban between the 3 of you  Srich  any further edits by you this talkpage will be considered harassment unless it is a formal notification or valid warning of some type  Hugo have a little good faith sometimes  I declined your unblock after it already expired  thats proven  Now if you really want Xero unblocked youd be wise to stop raising shit
