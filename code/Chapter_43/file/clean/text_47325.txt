Some other inaccuracies or perhaps misconseptions is a better word first you assume that taking part in a war for independance is a violation of ones obligation that is often a matter of interpretation  To a Mason like George Washington he was not being disloyal to England rather he was upholding his obligation by being loyal to the country in which he lived ie Virginia and later America  Second You seem to assume that Masons were united in their opinions  They were not  In each of the conflicts you mention there were Masons on both sides all of whom felt that they were living up to their obligations  Freemasonry was just as divided as the rest of society Yes today we celebrate those famous Masonic Leaders Washington Franklin and Handcock thats because they won  If the Americans had lost the war for independance you would probably read all about those famous Masonic Leaders Bannister Tarlton Phillip Skeen and General Cornwallis  As Lexicon says you can not make the assumption that Freemasonry is involved in independance movements only individual Freemasons  Freemasonry is often involved on both sides
