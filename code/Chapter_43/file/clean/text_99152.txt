It seems to me that the Grinnell Glacier picture was taken from near the summit of Mount Gould about midday A midmorning time would reduce the shadows on the left side of the image I would guess the ascent to be straightforward from the Highline Trail and could be done in about 15 hours It would be splendid to have a high quality current picture for Retreat of glaciers since 1850 especially if it shows significant change since 1981  talk
