I see you have already been cited for prior abuses but I will take you at your word that this administrator elitism is pervasive To be honest this episode has given me a lot of insight into the social structure of Wikipedia Apparently administrators such as yourself stare at a screen looking to censor anything but the most innocuous contributions from anonymous editors The NPOV fact that Tom Delay was found guilty of money laundering is suppressed by a very conservative editor who by his own admission supports the very controversial Confederate States of America I am African America and find the Battle Flag of the CSA to be very offensive and a response from me on his Talk page the proper forum to discuss such issues results in the threat of a ban from another conservative editor with a history of prior abuses If ANI is not the place to resolve our dispute maybe I should reach out to the ACLU
