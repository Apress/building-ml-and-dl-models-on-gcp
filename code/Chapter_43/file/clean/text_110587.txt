Good Samaritan Hospital 
Thanks for the copyedit I cant believe I missed so many   
No problem As Im going through Wikipedia articles every once in a while I see a worthy article that needs some assistance While so many will just walk by and ignore the article or even worse try to get rid of it I hope that by stopping to edit the article that I can offer some of the assistance the article needs to get on its way
