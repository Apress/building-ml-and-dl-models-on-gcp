Battle of Britain Aircrew 

Thanks for helping me with the BoB aircrew list Im now in Canada so probably working on it through your night  Do you have access to Kenneth Wynnes book Men of the Battle  I cant get hold of a copy out here so if you can get one from a library it would be fantastic
Theres loads of events going on to celebrate the 70th Anniversary  check them out at httpbattleofbritain1940netbobhsocindexhtml  I just wish I were in the UK  I doesnt seem like five years since I was saluting Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as they unveiled the Battle of Britain Monument in London
Best wishes and thanks again
