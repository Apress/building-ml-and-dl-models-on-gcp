Sekrit answer can you tell SF that I saw someone comment of 8 significant edit wars to break out during the case WMC was a primary participant in seven of them is twaddle you may of course use rather more polite phrasing or not at your pleasure and that commenting on such a case by merely repeating tittletattle is a poor way for an Arb to behave
 As for Coren I dont think there is much hope of cradcking the veil of denial but Hs comment xhez NYB first that you should immediately cease all backroom negotiations is interesting  perhaps you could ask C if any deals were done Also Id be grateful if you could entirely ignore Cs advice about whipping the incident into a froth your risk  that is all selfserving on Cs part They are embarrased by the stupidity of the situation they have created and are desperately hoping everyone will shut up
 As for RD you should point out the anomaly of my being blocked while Cla gets off free
