Sorry I messed up Can you find a different wikipedia user who is willing to include an acceptable article The Last Airbender worst movie article Please do because I know it has definitely earned its reputation for being the worst movie ever made Another movie that also earned its worst movie reputation is The Cat in the Hat 2003 live action movie Im sorry I wasnt able to contribute an acceptable article anyways Im going to let someone else post The Last Airbender movie I wouldnt have tried to post The Last Airbender if it wasnt considered the worst movie Im very sorry for M Night Shyamalan and his actors and actresses who didnt know how to make it like the cartoon Avatar The Last Airbender TV series Anyways Ill be waiting for The Last Airbender movie to show up in Films considered the worst
