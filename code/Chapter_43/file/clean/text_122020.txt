Avoiding sportscaster grammar 

  
Why is there now a would epidemic in writing about sports  I remember when Notre Dame simply finished or endured or went  now they would finish would endure and would go  This is bad grammar and it reads like exjock sportscasters sound  ignorant but wanting to seem important  Lets try not to become part of the problem  Past tense is perfectly acceptable and at times is necessary if we wish not to look and sound like morons who try and fail to be eloquent
