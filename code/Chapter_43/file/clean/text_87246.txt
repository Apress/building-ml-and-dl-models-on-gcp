I have to agree with the deletion MPerel I personally find in an interesting perspective but there are a couple fatal problems with it as far as including it in Wikipedia First it is essentially an Israelis interpretation of the Palestinian perspective  a secondary source Its probably accurate but I cant imagine that there is such a dearth of Palestinians offering their perspective that an Israeli has to be found to speak for them Second hes not really that notable within the context of this article In an article on Israeli peace activists he would be notable but here he is marginal That said it would be nice to replace his quote with something that gives a broad Palestinian perspective
