Art Jewelry Forum
Hello I am working on a pet project to help digitize information about the field of metalsmithingjewelry I started with making a page for Art jewelry forum AJF and have a list of artists that I would like to make pages for as well The AJF page has been nominated for deletion because it is questioned if the organization is notable I am reaching out to you because I saw that you edited some pages that relate to studio craft and thought you may have an informed opinion unlike the mathematician who nominated the page for deletion about whether or not it is a notable organization If you have an opinion one way or another please way in on the articles for deletion discussion httpsenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaArticles_for_deletionArt_jewelry_forum
