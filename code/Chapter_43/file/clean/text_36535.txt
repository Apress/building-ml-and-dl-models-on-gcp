Straw Poll   I think I know what you were trying to do but its best left unsaid If any editors are sincerely interested in the article they will go through the talk page line by line just like I did when I first came Thats a pretty pathetic excuse you just gave me talk   
 The Catholic Church talk page is conducting a straw poll here  to decide on a new version that will drastically eliminate about 50 of the information on the page including the Origin and Mission section and the Cultural Influence section and much of everything else   
 The new shorter version is here  and the older more informative version is here  A support vote will make the page become the shorter version an oppose vote will reject that proposition
