Picking fight

Yeah youre making yet another threat based on the utterly pathetic authority youve got as Wikipedia Administrator

What can one make of this

You see Im fervently hoping that you confirm my thesis that you are a fool You can fulfill my hope by banning me

You are misremembering your earlier threat to delete I suggest looking at talk page for Buckberg where these silly threats are on record

Why cant you now recall this Are you fundamentally dishonest to yourself or only to me
