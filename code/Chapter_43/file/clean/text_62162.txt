Hi Jay I disagree with you on that There are two topics here One is about the actual Jews of Syria or from place XYZ and then there is their history two entirely different fields of study In the case of Syrina Jews they have their own Halachic customs and they are a subethnicity like Yemenite Jews and their types extend beyond Syria or Yemen but when they were IN Syria or Yemen they had long histories not related to their ethnicity per se You seem to lack the historians appreciation of Jewish history and it only serves to undercut the quality of the articles by creating compressed versions of two streams of scholarship
