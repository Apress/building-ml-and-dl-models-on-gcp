Hello friend 

Just to tell you that I cannot tolerate wrong information on wikipedia 
You guys have to give all aspects of a information be it good bad acceptable unacceptable or controversial without hiding anything to make the information complete  Wikipedia is the information people trust upon so it implies that has to be 100 true Be bold that is how you can bring a change you are in the position to do just that 
One who fears has a very good reason that he cannot face the truth
