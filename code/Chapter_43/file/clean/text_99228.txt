WP admins 2 The request to replace Webapp user account with this user account here was both requested and approved by the WP admins Issue 1 article was removed 2 months after  a harsh discussion concerning notability not spam suggesting that my involvement on that discussion was spam is nothing but a lie 2 if Webapp user was such a bad boy 2 years ago how come the transfer to the new account was requested  and approved I would appreciate an honest and deeper look into the facts underlying ethos and logs there has been to much pathos reasoning taking place already Thank
