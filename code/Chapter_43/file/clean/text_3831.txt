Marduk  Abraham 

The early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world

Marduk is a regional variant of Abraham So is Zoroaster

Adam as we know him was the first prophet of Dyeus and the first human consciousness we see in history Dyeus became Zeus Jupiter with piter from fertilitycult distortions and Yah etc God ofcourse for many
Idris was the second prophet of Tengri which became Thor many places sometimes god sometimes more of a prophet and again Indra Prometheus Osiris
These concepts are known everywhere with local variations
Knowing the regional names one can see the same change in the regions who talk about Marduk as here A change from early prophetic teachings to that of Abraham

And Sarai of the Bible is Saraswati in Hinduism and Sarpanit here Obviously we all have the same prophetic line teaching monotheism  God is without others

Peace Be With You
