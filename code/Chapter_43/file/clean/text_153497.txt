Article flagged  could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode 

Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand Firststatistically pit bulls are less agressive naturally than beagles german shepards and other breeds Secondly the dogs only want to please their owners that is why if you watch the disgusting videos of dog fighting you will see 90 of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owners encouraging them to fight A perfect example is the Michael Vick case his dogs were taken and put into kennels as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the high profile of the case Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down which means that is only 12 Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too Blame the Deed NOT the Breed which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs just the ones that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls I mean there was Petey little rascals and betty boop had a pitbull Plus many other famous actorsactresses  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start but is insufficient I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission but Im adding a request in any case   

 Why does the article need that Any dog breed can attack  Theres nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks The muzzle image is fine it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public  Talk 

 A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article  Or a Jew in a concentration camp or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression but those wouldnt be true to Human character would they   

Isnt a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws Some places such as some public parks require all dogs to be muzzled while attending regardless of breed so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations As I wrote in my first post for an article that discusses pit bull attacks an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text WikipediaImages Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the articles topic Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images httpwwwktulcomnewsstories0108485244html and httpdallasmorningviewsblogdallasnewscomarchives200802mandatoryconfihtml Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons I remember there used to be a photo of a smiling pit bull in the article see archive Nov 1 2007 We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance
