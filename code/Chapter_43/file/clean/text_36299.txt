No I specifically made the proposal as I did to get an answer to the question How much of the time does this article spend in a vandalized or erroneous state In other words for a given interval this article spends X of the time being a bad source of information From which one can infer that ones chances of getting bad information from it based on a random visit are also X
It would be interesting I guess to find out how many times its been vandalized in some interval but I think the number above would be a more useful metric
