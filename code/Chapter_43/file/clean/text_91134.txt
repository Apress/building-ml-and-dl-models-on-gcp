Abstract
Background
Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging burning and biting sensations under the skin Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease

Methods
Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination designated as the fiber group were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers

Results
The fiber group consisted of 122 patients Significant findings in this group were an association with tickborne diseases and hypothyroidism high numbers from two states Texas and California high prevalence in middleaged Caucasian women and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse Although depression was noted in 29 of the fiber patients preexisting delusional disease was not reported After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were crawling sensations under the skin spontaneously appearing slowhealing lesions hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal intense pruritus seedlike objects black specks or fuzz balls in lesions or on intact skin fine threadlike fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin lesions containing thick tough translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out

Conclusions
This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease

Introduction
Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging biting and crawling sensations under the skin1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation MRF website more than 14000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease2 Considerable suffering occurs as threadlike fibers work their way out of the victims skin causing pain itching and open disfiguring lesions Figures 1 and and22 Unfortunately patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease35 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission6

The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 Figures 3 44 and and55 Observation of the skin with a lighted handheld 30  to 60  magnifier enables visualization of these red blue black and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped fuzz balls or as black specks the size of coffee grains Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers6
