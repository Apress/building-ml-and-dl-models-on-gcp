Hello Bellman

I really like the Australian and New Zealand Flags alot   Their respectively National Flags Blue Ensigns are both elagant and beautiful designs in my POV  I also love their Red Ensign counterparts

I really love this Star Constillation theme  The Australia and New Zealand Red Ensigns have the Southern Cross and in kinship the proposed Canadian Red Ensign has Big Dipper

I sincerely hope that the Red Ensign page will become unlocked someday and your contributions Bellman would be a true pleasure to read

Sincerely
