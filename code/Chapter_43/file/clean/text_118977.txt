I dont care either way  The line about 23 times as high was put in many months ago in order to satisfy arguments from people in YOUR camp not mine  I didnt want it there to begin with and I will now remove it   Furthermore I didnt put in the statement about may be a function of low student happiness  that is pure speculation and I am removing it  None of this changes the information conveyed and therefore I am satisfied with it  I hope that you people can live with this compromise as well  Honestly the information needs to be conveyed and I think you guys can help make it sound objective without making it sound positively biased
