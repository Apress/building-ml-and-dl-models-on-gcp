Just for hahas would someone want to calculate how much of the time this article exists in a vandalized state based on the history log say over the last couple weeks or so Or pick any random interval In other words what are the chances that a random visitor here will see a vandalizederroneous article Im curious My feeling unconfirmed by evidence as of yet is that this article spends a significant amount of time in a corrupt state as do many many articles on this socalled encyclopedia
And yes Im too lazy at the moment to do this Besides Im not really a statistician
