Please consult the article Ball culture which states drag queen or transgendered WPOR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together  As well the term Femme queen does not have an article so the term is currently of dubious usage as its a neologism which WP policy suggests to avoid using  You state a source TGMSMNET however neither this page nor the mainpage refer to such a reference  From the way you talked about it I linked it to the MSTSW reference  In the future if you could could you please site resources on this page by using this form httpexamplecom httpexamplecom That way it shows up like this httpwwwexamplecom and one can simply click on the resource rather than search through the article for the reference itself  Your data is backed up there as well  However we still have issue how would the CDC consider a postop MTF living in stealth as anything else but a female the MTF would obviously not admit to being a transsexual and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female  I wait for further evidence that TGTS is caused by biological factors and thus the term biological malefemale becomes complicated in even research no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is biologically a male  As well I understand the point of not using WP as a soap box however in talk pages Im still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having URAP
