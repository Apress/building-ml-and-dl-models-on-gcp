Unblock 3

I understand i am blocked but without reason I was trying to reach an administrator to unblock me and not to evade a block 

Look at this section He is talking rude about me although he has been warned 

Dave did NOT disengage

And next 

Dave1185 is just an insulting rude editor Look at the top of his homepage TAB 
Vandals trolls and other fiendly visitors please note Wikipedia is a community not a crazy den of pigsTAB 
Social experimenters please note Were an encyclopedia not a bunch of lab rats in a cageTAB 
I personally try to respect anyone and not to prejudice like Dave1185 That does not mean that i am always forgiving I DO judice But even just using the ugly rudeness of   

I cant see whats wrong about that Just repeating that Dave1185 is calling others pigs 

I am blocked for repeating the words of Dave1185 

So there is no reason at all to block me

There is no reason for a block Just block UserDave1185 and UserEdgar181 

UserDave1185
is harassing UserWispanow for hours on many usertalk pages    and did not not stop He was warned  He was additionally warned several times by me Wispanow

Another link

I request to block him

UserWispanow
was blocked without any reason Just for repeating the rude comments of others The block was made by Edgar181 

I request to immediately unblock him 

UserEdgar181
blocked UserWispanow   without any reason Just because Wispanow was requesting UserDave1185 to stop harassment

I request to block him
