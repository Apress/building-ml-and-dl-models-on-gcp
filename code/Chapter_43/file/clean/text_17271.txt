Hi  I see that the article in question is one that you have created yourself good job However it contains a number of issues apart from the one that you have just statedencyclopaedic tone The page has no real references apart from the club website so statement like This step taken by him was heavily condemned by the Bagan fans seems to be your personal opinion Here is a grammatical mistake Bagan confirmed the signing of an well experienced These are just a couple of examples

Please correct these issues If you feel that I have made a mistake please report it to other editorsadmins and Im sure they will resolve the issue for you
