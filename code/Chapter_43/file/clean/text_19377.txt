Hey
whose entire existence here seems to be devoted to defending one editor feel free to look at my contributions anytime and eat your fucking crow I could take a comment like this from someone who has actually done something for this project not from someone with 3000 article edits and a pitiful list of created articles 22 of which are copies of another Entire existence is the kind of hyperbole you are welcome to use of course but using it to attack me on a public noticeboard just exposes you for the mediocre editor you are since it invites an investigation into your own existence I thought you did well to stay away from MF for a while but I guess you cant teach an old dog new tricks
