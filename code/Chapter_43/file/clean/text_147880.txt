Conclusion 

I dont know whats your problem with the word conclusion but changing it to opinion weakens Davis teachings and makes him appear unauthoritative He descended from that lineage and in that book he is presenting each of the gurus in his own parampara It wasnt research or scholarly work it was a Kriya Yoga textbook written by an insider an ordained representative of the same lineage that is being discussed It is not a book of conjecture or hypothesis If Davis claims that Mahavatar Babaji is Hairakhan Baba then that is clearly his conclusion it is not some popular idea that he just presented for the readers to decide he stated it as a fact The person is a Guru of the Mahavatar Babaji line not just an ordinary initiate
