Tens of thousands of innocent Muslims  Jaysus gimme a puff of whatever you are smoking  Either its good stuff or I need a new calculator  Noone has killed tens of thousands of ANYBODY  Need I remind you that it was rhetoric which started the Tan war and the Civil War   Plus all the actions of the various bodies calling themselves the IRA since 1922 and who all claim descent from 1st Dail   Isnt that what they all start out with we are the legitimate successors of Dail Eireann  Need I also remind you that on the day of 911 it was only the grounding of all transatlantic flights which prevented terrorists detonating devices on US airliners heading out of Great Britain   For the record I abhor violence in any shape or form but am realistic enough to know that wars happen  Even Irish troops have killed people in modern conflicts you know and been killed themselves  Look up Operation Rum Punch  As for Irish Republicans I can condemn them just as easily as I can condemn rabid Loyalists   We were born into the Realpolitik of Irish affairs that doesnt mean to say we have to repeat the mistakes of previous generations by perpetuating the hatred and sectarianism which partition accentuates   There are times when I wish the Civil War had been between the North and South because no matter who feckin won at least it would all be over now and wed have learned our lesson  then again maybe not because the Irish north and south are that imaginative that theyd soon find another reason to start it all over again  Something along the lines of you calling the Briish guys who dont share your views Nationalists which you well know irritates them because of its racist connotations
