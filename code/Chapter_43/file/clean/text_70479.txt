I would certainly suggest that the wording be altered that references his bestselling author status since as a nonUS citizen I hadnt even heard of him before I started researching Mormonism to a deep degree  I feel its quite weaselwordy to say that hes an American author and then say separately that hes a bestselling author because the way that is done implies hes a bestselling international author which clearly isnt the case judging by the fact that Amazoncom rank his book 25 out of 100 in the category Mormonism Controversial and only in the late 617000s as an overall sales rank
