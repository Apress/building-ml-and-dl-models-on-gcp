Repeated falsification of Tabors views by several IPs was judged by an admin to be vandalism  That is why the article was locked  Admins dont lock articles for violations of OR  I have reread WPNPA  I agree with you that I should not have called the IPs religious bigots  Rather I should have said that their vandalism was religious bigotry because they knowingly falsified a secondary source and replaced it with their own theological POV  

No you should have called their actions vandalism Bigotry is something different  smile back
