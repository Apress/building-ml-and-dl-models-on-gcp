Editing Etiquette 

Hello
Please can i ask that in the interest of courtesy and for ease of understanding when making edits like you have done to Fantasy Ride can you provide an WPedit summary this helps other editors identify what changes have been made to articles I know myself that sometimes i forget to do so but it does make things easier for other users if you can provide a brief summary of the additionsdeletions or changes you have made to an article
