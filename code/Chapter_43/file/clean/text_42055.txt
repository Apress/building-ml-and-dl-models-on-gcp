In the 60s there were no fraternities at ISU and Normal was a dry town By the time of the infamous beer riots Normal was no longer dry and there were frats all over the place I can imagine Jesse Fell doing the toldyouso dance I dont mean to imply there was nothing at all going on at ISU in the late 60s There were indeed demonstrations and no small amount of tension on campus Just not like at SIU where they had to close the campus and send everyone home following the 1970 riots  Whats up Doc carrots
