Answer to Ftutocdgs claims above
There is no interpretations or gossip or false allegation All these points have been already cleared in this talk page above in the last AFD and in current AFD 

Khuzaima officially claimed to Qutbi Bohra in the article of Hindustan Times on 15 April 2013 and again as mentioned in this article at the time of succession in Indian Express on 6 February 2014

Just see the article of April 2013 it refers to a person Hasan name changed who is talking with his family for six months regarding converting to Qutbi Bohra sect no person would take such a major decision of his life based on a rumor further more it is mentioned that other than his family 15 other families have decided to follow Qutbi Bohra sect That would amount to 64 people deciding to follow Qutbi Bohra just based on a rumor No the word rumor is added to undermine the truth This article was published by reputed newspaper on the front page newspaper will not print rumors on first page and the article is not a rumor

It can be seen in the Azad 54 issue where Qutbi Bohra and Khuzaima Qutbuddin  is clearly mentioned and the number of people deciding to join the sect is put at 640

In the same article Saifuddin Insaf claims While the mazoon Khuzaima Qutbuddin has declared on record that he is the Syednas successor There is no clarity as to how much support he has Now where is this on record that Saifuddin Insaf is mentioning about It is this article in which Khuzima Qutbuddin has provided the declaration

Now to answer the connection This person Saifuddin Insaf is a Progressive Dawoodi Bohra and is the executive secretary of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra an organisation formed by Asghar Ali Engineer Asghar Ali Engineer is also the founder and leader of Progressive Dawoodi Bohra sect The autbority with which Saifuddin Insaf asserts that  Khuzaima Qutbuddin has declared himself successor shows the close relation between Qutbi Bohra Progressive Dawoodi Bohra and Asgher Ali Engineer

The aggressivity of Khuzaima Qutbuddin towards Syedna Muhammad Burhanuddin can be seen from the number of times raza permission had been blocked on Khuzaima Qutbuddin for different acts and omissions by Khuzaima Qutbuddin Mentioning the acts will be amount to defamation of Khuzaima Qutbuddin but since Ftutocdg insists so much and since this is talk page let me mention two incidents 

Performing a get together without raza permission when Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin is nearby admist a function For this Khuzaima Qutbuddin was reprimanded

Khuzaima Qutbuddins aide declared Khuzaima Qutbuddin as successor of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin in a get together it evoked a very angry response from the members of Dawoodi Bohra sect and also angered Syedna Muhammed Burhanuddin who not only reprmanded Khuzaima Qutbuddins aide but took back all his titles and then reprimanded Khuzaima Qutbuddin by canceling Khuzaima Qutbuddins raza Khuzaima Qutbuddin as he claims today never kept quiet of his intentions of becoming the successor but planned ways to bring his intentions into the open

There were many such incidents of aggressivity towards Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin but cant be mentioned due to defamatory nature

The sequence of events for formation begin from the wrongful act of Khuzaima Qutbuddin in Africa in 2003 because of which not only his raza was cancelled but it also ended any claims he might have of becoming a successor The act cannot be mentioned due to defamatory reasons This is what led Khuzaima Qutbuddin to form Qutbi Bohra sect in 2004 and taking the help of Asghar Ali Engineer who in turn gathers all reformist in a conference in 2004 ref given in article to get support for Qutbi Bohra sect 

The progressive theology is clearly mentioned in all article especially verbally by Khuzaima Qutbuddins son the Progressive Dawoodi Bohra members Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra members in newspaper articles related to succession issue Even the exChief Justice of India who is the member of Progressive Dawoodi Bohra sect claimed Khuzaima Qutbuddins support

In the last two para the He refers to Asghar Ali Engineer He has written 70 books and a 1000 articles One of his article is given one can see the amount of hard feelings he has towards Dawoodi Bohrs sect He organised verbal attacks through his gatherings meetings etc excerpts can be seen in Azad and his articles Tried to corrupt minds of people of Dawoodi Bohra sect by publishing false information in newspapers making false claims like the one in The Times of India mentioned in Azad 2005 issue Filed cases in 2004 itself Asghar Ali Engineer filed 3 cases against Dawoodi Bohra community under the banner of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra He has also filed many cases u
