ah yeah i was hoping the literal translation was gonna make sense in english or with the context you would have i cant really figure what it would be in more typical english because this sentence in dutch is i think as unspecified as the english sentence i gave so it would depend on context 
i also think the Dutch sentence may be a somewhat inaccurate translation form German or English itself so
but as the sentence is is supposed to mean that it fails requirement for inclusion in Wikipedia which i find somewhat odd

i would guess what theyre trying to say is that the article is a stub and requires more contend Lygophile has spoken
