In response to the request for verification of the Akins coat of arms I went to the library and photographed the pages from the book A History of Steele Creek Presbyterian Church 17451978 that pertain to the tombstone of Thomas Akins who is buried in the cemetery I have uploaded photographs of the pages from the book onto photobucket they can be viewed at https1038photobucketcomalbumsa470the_scotsman1745Genealogical20recordsactionviewcurrentsteele_creek_01jpg and https1038photobucketcomalbumsa470the_scotsman1745Genealogical20recordsactionviewcurrent008jpg I have also been in contact with a Mr John Cox in Charlotte NC who is a photographer that posts photos on Flickr He has a photograph of the back of Thomas Akins tombstone on his photostream httpwwwflickrcomphotosjohnncox4061843066 and has agreed to take a new photograph of the front of the monument showing the coat of arms in better detail

In addition there is a court record relating to Thomas Akins death that is recorded in the Mecklenburg County North Carolina Minutes of the Probate Court which reads as follows 1785 September Session Ordered that Letters of Administration on the Estate of Thomas Akins Decd issue to William Akins who produces Hugh Parks as Security bound in 600 Administrators SwornWyvren talk
