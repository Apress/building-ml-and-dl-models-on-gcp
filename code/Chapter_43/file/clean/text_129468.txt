OCA 
Thanks for your additions to Oregon Citizens Alliance As you may be aware Wikipedia standards require that factual items be cited to reliable sources So the info that you added should ideally have citations both confirming that the OCA was behind the measures mentioned and confirming the voting percentages Im going to leave it in for the moment because it looks accurate to me but without citations its likely the information will be deleted by another editor before too long
