I saw your comment on the talk page and wanted to drop by to remind you to avoid personal attacks and that all material must be verifiable and properly sourced You might be also interesting in reading our policies on original research Also remember that uncited material particularly if it is contentious can be removed at any time And for the record I dont have any whales and even if I did I cant swim so they probably wouldnt be of much use to me Cheers
