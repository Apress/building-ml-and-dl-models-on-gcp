Perhaps if both questions had been asked in the same survey do you understand the scientific method and do you believe in ESP and the results had shown a significantly greater level of ignorance of the scientific method amongst ESP believers than others then your conclusion might be valid As it is you have two different surveys about two different things and you cannot simply join up the results to show what you want to show Consider if a third survey had shown that 99 of the population believes the world is round could you then conclude that the vast majority of those that believe the world is round only do so because they do not understand the scientific method
