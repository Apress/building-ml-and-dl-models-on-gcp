Freezing 

The article says that the Romans were freezing asparagus in 200BC  I think an explanation of this may be useful as it seems highly improbable  Was it taken up in the mountains en masse or was there a freezing device available etc 

I clarified the freezing reference which was from here  However it would be good to get the original reference rather than a modern webpage
