Not Quite Identical Oaths 
The space filled by AB in the 5 USC 3331 is currently being used for more than just name as currently shown in the article  The army history site httpwwwhistoryarmymilhtmlfaqoathshtml indicates the oath of office includes the phrase having been appointed and also includes the branch of service and grade of appointment The Air Force on AF IMT 133 includes name having been appointed grade and branch of service  Space is also left for the category if that applies  Based on these two examples I imagine the Coast Guard Navy and the other uniformed services have their own variations  The essence of the oath is the same but the variations should probably be noted  As written it seems misleading as I did a doubletake when checking here to verify I had remembered it correctly  I was questioning my sanity until I found the AF IMT with the official USAF version
