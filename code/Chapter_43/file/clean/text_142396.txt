Hi Netsnipe 
Im just letting you know I think there may have been an injustice done with the the block applied to the above user Admitedly I havent checked all his edits in detail but the last couple of hours himself and 4 other editors myself included have been reverting alot of vandalism and WPNPOV edits by User_talk67729887 who is now blocked Could you please revisit this decision or if it for reasons that I am not aware please accept my apologise Regards   talk  contribs 

I didnt block  I blocked User talkTripleH1976 for WP3RR The block notice on Lordkazans page was a mistake and Ive removed it But anyway Ive asked  to review TripleH1976s block
