I am the one who originally added Kelley to the category  I readded him today  Noting that he refers to Leonard Peikoff and Harry Binswanger as two leading Objectivists which they are not though they claim to be it appears that he is an adherent of the dogmatic AntiReason Institute
 Im not so sure that Greenspan belongs in that category though  To be sure he was an Objectivist during the time of the Collective but Im not sure he is one today nor do I know if he still considers himself to be one  I raised this issue on Category talkObjectivists a few days agois the category for people who CLAIM to be Objectivists or for those who actually ARE Objectivists  As a devoted opponent of the ARI perhaps Im not the best person to judge this distinction I know of a few Objectivists who are in fact blissfully ignorant of the schism or at least think its all bullshit but this is something that needs to be decided
