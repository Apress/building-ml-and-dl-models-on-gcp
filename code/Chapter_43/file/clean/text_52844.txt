Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi Satyr  Youll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us on the Wagner subproject a few months ago  How are you fixed at present  Wed like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a Start rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub

Exceptions  articles which have been promoted to Good Article Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner  Also it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually destubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start

Wed like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments  For the Wagner project you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link  if a comments page is present theres a link but if not not  The link will nevertheless appear and work if a comments page is subsequently added

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted maybe

Hope to hear from you when you have a moment  Best
