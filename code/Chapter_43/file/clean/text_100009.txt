Stabbed Kercher getting axed
Hello Wikid77 here I am contacting a few admins about this Now that UserZlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing Murder of Meredith Kercher the wholesale axing of fullysourced text has begun See removal of forensics The apparent WPWikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman with legal expertise trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms I warned beware of colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia Perhaps if American student Amanda had been Adam Knox then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20 misquoted infamous statements I didnt know any evidence in December 2009 now I know much and some seems falsified in Italy Zlykinskyja tried to add how Donald Trump rejected the verdict source but that was quickly deleted Some US officials are conducting a mocktrial by judge to compare verdicts but I doubt that could be explained in the article Then some prankster this week posted at top Breaking news Knox dead in prison from suicide details not confirmed from an IP edit in the London area and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that I wish we could split the article into several lowtarget subarticles I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles The talkpage has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on Amanda Knox and naturally a prior subarticle was AfD deletedHowever I suggest the following
 Amanda Knox redirect  becomes broad neutral article with civil suits appellate trial and college coursework in prison
 Raffaele Sollecito redirect  becomes broad neutral article noting he completed his computer degree while in custody and they met at a classical music concert because he looked like Harry Potter
 Prosecution of Amanda Knox new  would contain all the proantiKnox text moved from editwars in the Kercher article
 Investigations of Kercher murder new  would be a forensic article with fingerprints Low copy number DNA luminol unidentified DNAprints listing exact quotessources etc
 Murder of Meredith Kercher reduced  would be trimmed into an overview linking sections to subarticles
I have seen how other articles split into subarticles greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details so that forensic details would likely match the sources when viewed there This message is just a general notice sent to a few admins and I dont expect an immediate response Also feel free to delete this knowing it was posted in a 1 May talkpage revision as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text Thanks
