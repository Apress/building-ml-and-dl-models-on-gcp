Worldwide military funerals

Being that I am from the US I am not knowledgeable about military funeral customs in other countries around the world Clearly I cannot edit in that section With that said I believe that the Worldwide section of this article needs to be expanded A better elaboration of military funerals in Commonwealth countries Britain Australia Canada etc would be beneficial as well But like I said I am an American so I am no expert on customs in other countries unless I do my own research Is anybody willing to add any input or thoughts
