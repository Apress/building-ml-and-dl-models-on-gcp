Should London be an event listed from 1972 to 1975 Should it not be Canada instead MontrealToronto varied according to year 

In the Wikipedia site for Wembley it says that the tournament wasnt played between 1972 to 1975 So the tournament winners for London that you have for those years Winners NÄƒstase 1972 Okker 1973 Connors 1974 Dibbs 1975  were at some other London tournament Did it have the prestige of Wembley in those years If you look at another very similar site

They have Canada listed in those years rather than London
