Is the hypothesis in such a sorry state that references have to be repeated 
See the reference to Evans and McConvell

And apart from Hales venom is there any chance of evidence ever being presented on this page

Just saying that one has used the  gasp  comparative method isnt particularly convincing

And these hundreds of cognates where are they

The mainstream appears to consist of Evans McConvell and Bowern more or less with Nobody doing the cleanup  or mostly clicking the undolink Even Lyle Campbell who should be pretty dispassionate about the subject calls for much more information and research and assigns PamaNyuangan the label of family status not confirmed

And please dont let poor Medeis do all the rollup Hes just a camp follower

Please present something convincing and most of all answer the question whether Hale committed the sins of glottochronology and mass comparison Dubbing the last one lexicostatistics doesnt make it any more respectable
