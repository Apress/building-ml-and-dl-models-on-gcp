That begs the question  You and your colleagues consistently argue that the only way forward is in dialogue or mediation with LoverofArt a good faith editor you say  Your words I will not ask good faith editors to retire from discussions because you simply disagree with them  Neither his attacks on me nor his editing technique show much good faith

So yes you seem to be in effect pressing a joint venture  intimating that either I join with LoverofArt in working on this project or else depart or be blocked from the site

For all of the speculation about my supposed detriments I have nonetheless managed to write for and be published by the Investigative Reporters and Editors Journal  more than once  a journal that is published by the respected School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in Columbia

My work was checked by the Executive Editor and staff  some of the most competent fact checkers in the entire business

No organization likes critics and the tendency to circle the wagons and define outsiders as illegitimate is predictable understandable

But LoverofArt unfortunately defamed the wrong organization  Wikipedia would be mistaken to allow him to continue in that vein
