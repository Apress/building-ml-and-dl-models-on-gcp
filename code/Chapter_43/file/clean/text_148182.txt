Bar Association of San Francisco  

Hi you deleted my post for the Bar Association of San Francisco  I have permission from the author and the Bar Association to use the language from the Bar Associations website under GFDL in the post  Should I get a confirmation email from the author to you directly or should I give you the email address of the author to get that confirmation  Im still learning the ways of wikipedia didnt realize I needed to have a confirmation email sent directly before posting  Also I would appreciate it if you could send me the deleted post or repost it because I do not have an archived copy with all of the external news links I put in to show its notoriety  Thanks

  
Apologies for the delay in replying I only just noticed your post Essentially there are a number of problems with the article besides the copyright infringement The article had a promotional tone and feel largely as a result of copying the material form the associations website With WP articles we try to maintain a neutral point of view so it may be a better idea to write the content in your own words The article alo didnt cite reliable sources for much of its content in order to help support the claim that the association is notable What Id encourage you to do is rewrite the article in your own words using the information from the various sources to guide you and having very little dependency on the associations own website If you feel you still need the deleted material for this please let me know and Ill strip out the references and provide them to you If theres anything else you feel you need or if youb have any questions please let me know Many thanks moff 

 Oxford Wikimania 2010 and Wikimedia UK v20 Notice 

Hi

As a regularly contributing UK Wikipedian we were wondering if you wanted to contribute to the Oxford bid to host the 2010 Wikimania conference Please see here for details of how to get involved we need all the help we can get if we are to put in a compelling bid

We are also in the process of forming a new UK Wikimedia chapter to replace the soon to be folded old one If you are interested in helping shape our plans showing your support or becoming a future member or board member please head over to the Wikimedia UK v20 page and let us know We plan on holding an election in the next month to find the initial board who will oversee the process of founding the company and accepting membership applications They will then call an AGM to formally elect a new board who after obtaining charitable status will start the fund raising promotion and active support for the UK Wikimedian community for which the chapter is being founded

You may also wish to attend the next London meetup at which both of these issues will be discussed If you cant attend this meetup you may want to watch WikipediaMeetup for updates on future meets

We look forward to hearing from you soon and we send our apologies for this automated intrusion onto your talk page
