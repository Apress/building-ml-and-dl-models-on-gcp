Ill confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions I can say that we should include all significant points of view even Geaves If some say that Rawat had a Sant Mat lineage while other say he had an Advait Mat or Radhasoami lineage then all of those views should be included in proportion to their prominence and we shouldnt take sides either directly or by implication Note that each of those linked topics has an article of its own so we dont need to discuss them at length in this article Anything we do say about them should be relevant to Rawat himself 
More broadly Id remind everyone that we have an entire article devoted to Rawats teachings Teachings of Prem Rawat The material in this article should simply be a summary of that article Since the introductory section of that article should also summarize that article in an ideal world we could simply copy to the intro here as a summary Unfortunately this is not an ideal world That article has needed work for years but there hasnt been any significant editing there in the past year May I suggest moving this discussion to that talk page     talk
