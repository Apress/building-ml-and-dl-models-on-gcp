Hello Ensiform Im not impressed by the dozens of books at Amazon for the simple reason that theyre all published by American Research Press or other vanity presses I have looked for peerreviewed work by others about Smarandache functions and whatnot and there appear to be about three papers or a maybe a few more But I think thats not immediately relevant as Ill try to state below

Smarandache appears to use publicly available resources to promote himself very diligently Usenet FOLDOC Mathworld at wolframcom and even Sloanes OnLine Encyclopedia of Sequences all have lots of Smarandacherelated entries Sloanes is an interesting case since each entry lists an author and for the Smarandache entries the authors are charlestleyahoocom and other possible pseudonyms Alsothe link shown on the FS talk page httpwwwuoregoneduncpSpamSpamFiles3DigitalLibSpamtxt appears to show him sending unsolicited email under an assumed name This suggests to me that it is possible that all edits on the FS page were made by him under assumed names At this point whether his reputation is welldeserved is irrelevant  0556 6 Jan 2004 UTC
