Most Overseas Chinese 華僑 do not consider themselves 中國人 but they do consider themselves 華人 with ancestry coming from what has been known as China in English even centuries before the PRC or the ROC was born  What Heilme keeps complaining about is that he thinks the China page is POV of saying Taiwan is part of China  But the article clearly spells out the current political confusion and conflict between the ROC and PRC over Taiwan  Hes not complaining about the possibility of a user wanting to read about China Maine when he searches for China  His complaint is not about the ambiguity of China but that he thinks the China page says that Taiwan is part of China  Instead of suggesting a change in the redirect he needs to go over to the China page and suggest that it deletes any reference to Taiwan
