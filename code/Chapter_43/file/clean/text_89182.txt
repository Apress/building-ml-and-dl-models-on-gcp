betacommandbot not notifying contributor
betacommandbot recently marked ImageFranklin Road Academypng as not having fair use rationale which was correct i had forgotten to do so so thank you however it never notified me of the marking of my image as without fair use rationale You should fix your bot so that it notifies the uploader that their content has been marked Thank you
