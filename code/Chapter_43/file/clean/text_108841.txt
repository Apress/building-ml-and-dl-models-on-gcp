oh please I think my arguments need a better response than just you calling for ceasing accusationsIts just that you dont even have an answer and you know exactly what you meant when you said that I am trying to make someone LOOK european what do you mean by concentrating on the topic I said enough about the topic we BOTH agreed that borders are not established yet that is why putting them in several regions but europe is uaaceptable  It either needs to be in Asian section as it is now already or in the western asian section where it is now already as well or the european section where it is listed as western asian or it does not have to be there at allit  is everywjere but in europe even though borders are not official yet WHY do you think it is very easy for you to put them in asia or western asia and not europe even though the borders are not established  why do you think those people and me I can imagine how big you think of you as european  are trying to LOOK and be european what gives you the right to give that supercilious evaluation  you are BIASED  thats the only explanationYES I am accusing you and I am accusing you of being a racist and being a paranoid that thinks that everyone is trying to be European and HUSOND is a brave person who does everything to protect them from Unnessesary people and people who he thinks are LESS than him personally because he is european Europe is like a priviledged section where countries can be put thats why its hard for them to be there and not hard to be in middle east even though the article itself says that first european homo georgicus was found in georgianext time if you will bother to write a response I urge you to adress all these REAL issues instead of calling for ceasing accusations
