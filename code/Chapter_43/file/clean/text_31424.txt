I consider your unwanted and unsolicited response to the exchange between me and an administrator on my own talk page to be harassment I thought that this was a dead issue but you are obviously trying to goad me into saying something uncivil to you so you can report me to an administrator and have me blocked again 

I have asked you not to place your unwanted and unsolicited comments on my discussion page NUMEROUS times yet you refuse to comply with my wishes When ever I placed a comment on your user discussion page in the past you had it promptly removed Why do you feel that despite my requests to the contrary you have a right to harass me 

Ill say this one time more in case you still dont understand PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE AND STOP POSTING UNSOLICITED AND UNWANTED COMMENTS ON MY USER DISCUSSION PAGE WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS SIMPLE REQUEST IF YOU CONTINUE TO HARASS ME I WILL REPORT YOU TO A WIKIPEDIA ADMINISTRATOR  0907
