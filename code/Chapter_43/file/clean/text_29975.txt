Now that the AN thread is closed I want reiterate that if the topic ban is not lifted before you need to reapply for the extra tools and if someone holds that topic ban against you I would be happy to explain to them that I was the proposer of the restriction at WPAN and it should be considered a minor thing as you are still allowed to participate and that restriction should NOT be used to limit your access to any tools   2    WER
