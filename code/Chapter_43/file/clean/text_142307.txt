My prediction is at least 5 more horribly bad mistakes by the Fox crew calling the game  Heres what I have so far
Tebow in trouble and hell scramble for a gain of one  a pause for about 5 seconds  Im thinking he sure looked like he got more than one  And he will get five more after that for a gain of six
When Oklahoma was on the goalline they called 2nd down 3rd down 3rd down 4th down then when they still had the ball they realized they were a down off  The commentator apologizes for not helping the playbyplay guy out there
On UFs TD the receivers rear end looked like it was down on the ground  They showed us 4 angles and paused it with the ball breaking the plane and still in his hand  Ok fine I believe you its not a fumble but how about pausing it where his rear end hits the ground and seeing if the ball is over the line yet
I sure dont remember Fox being this bad last year  they have just been awful this bowl season
