Conflict of interest means when Tvoz says nominating it for merge to Sarah Palin where it seems to belong at this point  In other words he believes that it belongs for merging at this point  Then Tvoz starts to take away material objecting to padding  I have just looked at how to kill an article  Notability is mentioned a lot  Article length is not a criteria  So feel free to propose killing the article after it has been given a chance  You may use the excuse is not notable but has too much padding is not a valid criteria  The quality of the article is not the deciding factor
