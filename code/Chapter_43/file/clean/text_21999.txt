Thank you DGG But Ive never advertised myself as a Wikipedia Manager I dont own any website where such an advert is placed Ill like  to see the link if youve got them Except if youre referring to my external profile links on Elancecom Freelancercom and Odeskcom On such platforms I only advertised my services as a Wikipedia editor alongside other services I render such as web content blogging ebook writing etc Wikipedia editing is just part of what I do I only started editing recently Thanks again
