Some Palestinian scholars are using the etymological relationship between the word Pal√¶stina and Philistine to pretend that the Palestinians are the remnants even are themselves the true Philistines and not the descendants of Arab conquerors mixed with native populations of Jewish Hellenistic Arabic or Aramaic descent who inhabited Byzantine Palestine before the Arab conquest Moreover abusing this historically inconsistent argument they go further to say that the IsraeliPalestinian conflict dates back to biblical times Linking the PalestinianPhilistines to their supposedly IndoEuropean ancestors they argue that the Jews an anachronism since at that period they did not exist as Jews before the Babylonian Exile stole the Land of the Palestinians at that very early period This way of importing Nazi style propaganda into the conflict is widely spread in some farright movements and has some misled followers outside those circles unfortunately many philistines use it in an undiscriminating way
