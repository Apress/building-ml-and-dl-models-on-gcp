Ravana Sri Lanka and Sinahalese  neutrality 
He was a Sinhalese Sri Lankan and  North Indian Hindi who wrote orginal Ramayana believes Ravan was Sinhalese  The Hindu reference 
As per Sri Lankan myths Ravana is very powerful  Raksha king lived in Sri Lanka who had two children named meganand and other but not mentioned any of Sita or Indian invasion This page is needed to rewritten in neutral manner Some Sri Lankan myths says Ravana was very powerful capable ruler and others couldnt fight with Ravana so they wrote a book in which they made him as a antagonist and reverted his real world victories by writing a novel 
I doesnt mean to remove any of myths written against him But to mention Ravanas cruelty raping women stories are taken from the hindu myth story Ramayanaya Otherwise stating them as real facts will harm the image of a famous Sri Lankan hero I will put neutrality tag for heavily based on Ramayanaya
