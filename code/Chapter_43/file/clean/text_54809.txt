US Department of State 

The US Department of State  says that Romanian is the official language of Moldova although this is inaccurate in the sense that while many believe Romanian and Moldovan to be the same language the constitution of Moldova specifies Moldovan as the official language rather than Romanian

Why is it inaccurate Heres the quote

 Languages Romanian officially known as Moldovan

We have Romanian officially known officially as Moldovan Is anyone disputing that
