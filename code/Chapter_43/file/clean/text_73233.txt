how do you get problem editors blocked without complaining about them 

how do you get problem editors blocked without complaining about them  i am at my wits end  I asked for help on the Judaism project page to get feedback on a proposed complaint so i could improve it so it would be readable accurate and neutral and within an hour Ive beened attackedwarned that doing so is violating rules and threatened with being permanently blocked this whole system seems stacked against newcomers  is this really how wiki works banned for seeking advice or is the person above threatening me against the rules and should I report him as well this is so confusing and unpleasant forgive me for whining  cimicifugia
