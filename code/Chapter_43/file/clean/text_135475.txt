Many thanks  apologies to others who have commented I found it impossible to make head or tail of wherewho I should ask my question

It would seem there is more than 1 actor called Colin Campbell my father born in 1937 was indeed in a television program called A Family at War where I noticed the deletion he is still alive but not too well so finding this was upsetting  incorrect  He also had a role in The Leather Boys if that helps to identify him

Thank you again for your assistance  hope Im writing to the correct person  I will also try to contact Kuru
