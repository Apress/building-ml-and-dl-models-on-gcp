Thanks for uploading ImageL34419cdd0000 2 15978jpg I noticed that the files description page currently doesnt specify who created the content so the copyright status is unclear If you did not create this file yourself you will need to specify the owner of the copyright If you obtained it from a website then a link to the website from which it was taken together with a restatement of that websites terms of use of its content is usually sufficient information However if the copyright holder is different from the websites publisher their copyright should also be acknowledged

 Replaceable fair use ImageL34419cdd0000 2 15978jpg 

Thanks for uploading ImageL34419cdd0000 2 15978jpg I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under fair use but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information If you believe this media is not replaceable please

 Go to the media description page and edit it to add  without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template
 On the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all

Alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or similar media under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself

If you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on  this link Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above fair use media which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification 7 days if not used in an artic
