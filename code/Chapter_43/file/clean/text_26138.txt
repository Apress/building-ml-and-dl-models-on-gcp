Views about slurs
Hello especially Haiduc The material removed here  was done so partially on the pretext of the claimed existence of a slur  

Men in pederastic relationships are accused of being necessarily materialistic and manipulative The claim is that the older partners interest in the younger is always purely for sexual gratification and that beneath a guise of caring or loving and a veneer of acceptability of endowing the younger partner with choice these relationships are universally damaging to the youth because they are based on mutual deception The attention given by the older to the younger is assailed as fundamentally selfinterested and the claim is made that the youths are discarded once past the age of attraction

Seriously I would like to identify which groups would consider it a reasonable statement or view and which groups would consider it a slur Any information on this may be enlightening
