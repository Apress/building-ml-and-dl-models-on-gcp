Dear Dmcdevit I dont admit any guilt in EDITING today You see all Wikipedians engage in edit wars some of them get punished for that If you decide to punish me let it be so If you decide to punish only me  well discuss it later if needed for now see the discussion below 
As for this so this is really serious My new lastresort method against Wikipropagandists Can you imagine what a mess would occur in Russiarelated pages if I fulfill my threat and recruit other Rusliterate Wikipedians to it without POVpushing or trolling mere supply of article names and external links In order to prevent that and keep each side on its country pages  you admins and bureucrats should carefully and ACTIVELY treat the issue of proRussian propaganda Thanks for your intervention and sorry
