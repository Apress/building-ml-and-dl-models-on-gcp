I have already asked you once to add reference needed tags or improve articles yourself rather than just reverting changes news sites ARE credible sources whether you think they are or not After I asked this of you instead you hunted down another article this time one I had created instead of one I had edited and proposed it for deletion This is considered harassment If you continue your current style of editing I will submit you to be blocked I have added Predictive Index to the list for reinstatement I assume you will not continue to demean my work by deleting for no other reason than you dont like my edits enough You are not contributing to the community in a positive way if you would like to talk about like an adult please respond dont just hunt and delete all my edits Im sick and tired of it seriously Ive been a contributor for YEARS longer than you and have never been treated with the disrespect that you have shown
