Hiyouve recently relisted  this AfD to generate further discussion Im still concerned this AfD has not been listed as a second nomination the first result was keep   1st Nomination discussion   Arent all 2nd nominations meant to be clearly marked for those who do not read everyone elses statements but prefer to simply look at the article and respond Can AfDs be closed and relisted or do 1st nomination dates have a natural expiry date  Im still fairly new and  curious thanks  Regards
