Paul talks about the war because that is what the liberal media types want to talk about but I have seen several reports that the average conservative voter is not primarily concerned with the war and wants to hear much more about real border security stopping abortion on demand and protecting second amendment rights in this specific order  Many neocons want the war to continue and dont want to talk about it at all I dont agree with that either it should be fully discussed However Paul says that he would much rather discuss other conservative issues and that the war is only discussed because the media types bring it up I just think that we should consider making the order that which is the priority of our primary audience for this page If conservatives are coming to this page with particular interests and priorties why should we let the liberally biased mainstream media dictate the order after all they wont even print a fair and objective story on the good man or reveal details of how their secretive scientific polls are conducted or whether he was excluded altogether Statistics dont lie the mainstream media apparently does Wikipedia is our chance to right this wrong and give our audience what they seek in the order that they seek it  0715 12
