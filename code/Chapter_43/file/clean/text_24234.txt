Reply re circularity and plagiarism

Thanks for pointing me to the new discussions But I probably wont engage there because IMO the issue at that particular article PolishLithuanian Commonwealth is already covered by the current passage in WPVERIFIABILITY stating that We should not source to material originating in WP since it creates circularity Verifiability is a core content policy and I dont suppose it changes much With regard to whether the discovery at the PLLT Comm article is a notable instance of plagiarism from WP by academics since the cited website is a collection of papers written by students and clearly published as such  authors and tutors on page 10  even tho the website was sponsored by an academic institution  I dont see it as notable occurence along those lines Of course others may well disagree
