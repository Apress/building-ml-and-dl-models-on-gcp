 This pages need serious considerations of revisal  

An ethnic group means sharing a large element of genetic relation amongst its members Afghans Tajiks included are closer related to Northwest South Asian populations GENETICALLY than to Iranian populations

Iranians on the other hand genetically cluster with South Caucasians Anatolians and Mesopotamians The only relation Tajiks have with Persian Iranians is a shared language and somewhatshared literary culture Other than that the genetics prove that they are not closely related groups   Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs

 request of an administrator  

Please revert this article this article is full of errors iranians and afghans are two different nationalities and ethnicities they can not be mixed according to wikipedia rules and according to the fact that persian iranians and afghans are not the same thing and can not be in the same category thank you  

 Second Paragraph Should Be Deleted 

Afghanis better known as Afghoonis or Efis and Afaghaneh are not part of the Persian people and they are acting as wannabe persians they are not proud of their nation and we Iranians hate them hate them hate them

This should be taken out of the article for obvious reasons
  

 afghoonis are not Persians 

afghanis are not persians austrians speak german but are not germans and they do not consider themselves as germans they are neither considered germans by the people of germany the people of switzerland speak french but they are only swiss and it is wrong to call the swiss peoiple as french people the people of belgium speak dutch but they are not dutch or netherlanders the people of brazil speak portuguese but they are not portuguese people they are brazilians speaking portuguese the people of ghana speak english but they are not english and finally the afghans speak a dialect of persian but they are not persians racially or ethnically or historically afghans are ethnically and racially a mixed nation the tajiks are related to people of central asia to the people of uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan the tajiks of afghanistan look exactly the same as tajik and uzbeks because they are the same the hazaras are not related to the iranian or persian race they are of mongol origin their hazaragi language which is a dialect of dari language is heavily mixed with the momgolian languiage their look and appearence attest to the fact that they are only assimilated mongols even the word hazara is a millitary unit which describe that they were a part of  the mongol chengiz khan army who destroyed civilization of iran including nishabur and tus and many other cities of khorasan khorasan is in iran and is iranian not afghani or afghanistan 

tajiks are iranized or persianized central asians like uzbeks are turkified central asian people tajik is NOT a synonym of persian or iranian tajik only refered to people of central asia which became iranized
