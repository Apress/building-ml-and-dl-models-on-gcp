The actors names in parenthesis 

Im reading over the article and it is very conspicuous to me how every time a character is mentioned the actors name appear in parenthesis  I think its a bit manic repetitious and unnecessary  Take for instance these exerts from the article

The article is describing the character history  Unless its a quote from the actors themselves continually referring to the actors who plays these characters distracts from the flow of the description and looks rather tacky  I say we remove the actors names and keep it focus squarely on the characters  The Real One Returns
