Owen Oyston  Baby Bells

Good work on Oyston and thanks for your comments 

Yes I actually agree with you about most readers at least the ones who are ever likely to read about Owen Oyston wouldnt ever have a clue about what a Baby Bell or even a Regional Bell Operating company is but I also figured that telling them that they are American still doesnt tell the reader anything that substantially affects that lack of understanding To make much sense of it I reason that they will still have to look Baby Bell or RBOC up  and when they do that then it will be obvious that it is an exclusively US thing 

That is how I reason it but there is no pride issue for me so feel free to change it back you dont like
