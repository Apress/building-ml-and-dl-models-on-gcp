Voice of Francis Griffin 

Hiya Zachary I just made an edit to the Holy Crap article changing the voice of Francis Griffin from Charles Durning to Colm Meaney based on source such as TV Guide However I see that you made a previous edit in which you stated that Meaney was not in the episode If this is true then please revert my changes if someone doesnt beat you to them However if possible and if you havent done so already could you please check the end credits of the episode to make sure that Meaney was not a voice actor in the episode If he wasnt then I think what we have here is a severe case of misinformation from many sources  apparently Meaney was originally cast for the role and may have actually done some of the voice work but was ultimately replaced with Charles Dunring who had to redo the dialogue Anyway if you could check on this that would be awesome Thanks
