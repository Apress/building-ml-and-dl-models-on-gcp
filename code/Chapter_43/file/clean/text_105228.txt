Ive been in communication with them all  and was completing an email to Jimmy Wales re the report it is about ironically Admin abuse of power the culture within and the source of the attrition issues facing WMF for the past 3 years  In short THEY formerly YOU  set an example of bullying behavior  Thats not important    Part of the research process requires me to invoke the best and worst behavior in order to have data for the study  DangerousPanda just blocked me for 60 hours and I have been keeping Sue Jimmy the Stewards and Oversight up to date I had a report due into them over 90 mins ago  What am I going to do now HELP  Thanks  Dr Matt Hogendobler     UserPresidentistVB  

P S Hes bragging about it in the Admin noticeboards group  Fortunately for him theres another admin with some sense to share with him  This is perfect data  But I am still in jail and I dont dare call Sue on a Sunday

 He cannot hes been blocked by me for a whole whackload of reasons that are painfully obvious to all  the panda   

 and hes removed his block notice  Ill let someone else take care of that  the panda   

 Er lest there be any confusion or misunderstanding blocked users are free to remove block notices from their own talk pages  There is no requirement that they wear a scarlet letter for the duration of their block so for the moment there is nothing to take care of  Encouraging someone else to go to his talk page and replace the block notice is just poking the bear  And its pretty obvious that this particular editor is already more than sufficiently wound up
A problem only arises if a blocked editor removes notices related to his or her block and then requests unblockingthe concern in such a situation is that an editor may be attempting to conceal or mislead regarding the reasons for their block  talk
