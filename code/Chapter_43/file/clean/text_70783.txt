Education
 I think half the prose on Salford University was mine perhaps I should not be reviewing this 
 One of the consequences of the Robbins Report was that the CAT dropped nonuniversity level courses so that was separated out into a technical college on the Frederick RoadA6 corner Salford tech By 2000 that seems to have become University College Salford  and subsequently merged with the University to become the Frederick road campsus That seems to have created more colleges to fill the gap
