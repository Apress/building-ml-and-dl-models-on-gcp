I have explained I will let others deal with this article now and return to editing the article at a later time 

I made a good faith attempt to present the IsraelPalestine aspect of this subject in a balanced way and would I was certainly willing to make changes where I missed that mark 

I do not think that Arimareijis changes are balanced nor do they give me the impression that they are intended to be balanced If you read the two versions side by side you will understand if indeed you intend to understand I will not trust you again although I am suppose your revert was in good faith
