Now the article incorrectly states that its just comic fans taking exception to the naming of the character rather than the credits being incorrect which is what the writer has said  Im changing it again to make it more neutral  I will keep Kid Omega as the first name mentioned to appease the letterofthelaw crowd however I still want to point out how ridiculous it is to accept information as true simply because of its source with its accuracy being regarded as secondary That is a logical fallacy
