reverting to last known edit by me 

The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here If sysops examine the network log files they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 911 Truth sites and the vast majority of exit links go to 911 Truth sites Therefore removing that information was damaging wikipedias reputation Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in which of course includes everything relating to 911 that was on that page

Using the CT term to describe 911 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV and therefore not civil Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 911 pages

As the Zogby poll shows 42 of America believes the government is covering up 911 and 45 want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved

For now on any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol

Also even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation I do apologize for them Anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages I expect anyone and everyone to be civil
