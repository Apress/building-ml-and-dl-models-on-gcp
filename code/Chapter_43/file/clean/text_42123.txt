Also I dont know if you find this relevant on the matter but Turian himself was blocked just the other day for acting uncivil towards me towards some other admins and on WPANI He was specifically blocked for violating WPCIVIL and WPDISRUPTIVE the same ones he is accusing me  of now This is obviously some kind of grudge WPGRUDGE I have always maintained myself civil and professional on every matter including when discussing with Turian He also  stated hed stop editing at the Pro Wrestling WikiProject and would leave me alone in his unblock request By recently editing WTPW and my talk page he obviously isnt following his word That is indeed a violation of WPCIVIL  2C lying to mislead G talk
