How do you get a site
Many penguins have asked this question
It is very simple just go to wwwwordpresscom and you can edit css and buy a domain but you have to pay for it 
and you can add other users to be part of youre blog
and you can get a meebo and a widget and also a million people to come to youre site if you had it for like about 3 or 2 years
also strancp does have a site  wwwstrancpwordpresscom
