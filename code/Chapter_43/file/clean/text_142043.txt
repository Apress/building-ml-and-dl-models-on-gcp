re Sarah Brightman peer review 

Thanks for the comments theyre much appreciated

About the context  Believe me Id love to find more material for this but everything Ive found seems to focus less on her and more on more recently prominent crossover acts Josh Groban Il Divo etc Im working on it though Not sure I should mention Amelia since she doesnt have an album out yet and its going to be released independently I still need to update for the greatest hits albums looking for good solid information on that
