The bottom lineRecapitulation
Hi I believe you used your administrator rights improperly since you accused me of multiple things I consider the content of the block message very offensive and untrue since the edit war technically didnt occur one false accusation then calling nonabusive ad hominem reactions as offensive personal attacksharassment second false accusation I realistically admit that policies of Wikipedia sometimes can be bureaucratically absurd like for example using specific descriptive words for  a young person will result in prohibition from contributing to Wikipedia since everything even AGF responses are considered as extreme personal attacks therefore we wont discuss the latter issue 
Multiple references like this one supports my Kylie Minogues revert and the user Nickyp88 is notified now to not revert other peoples edits over personal OR claims such as Nudisco No Disco Nudisco is different than disco But you clearly didnt want to hear my opinion and probably just let the ANI plebs decide my destiny  
Thank you for listening
