Please sign your comments so that it is clear to whom I am responding Please also use proper capitalization for Judaism and other proper nouns so that no inference of bigotry can be made Your comments are a non sequitur the costs to which you refer are discretionary marketing costs incurred by manufactures of products These costs are subject to management analysis cost accounting analysis and internal audit Kosher certification costs are rationally incurred to produce additional sales and profits

As someone who has performed cost accounting analysis for multinational manufactures of these products as well as auditing these costs as an external auditor I can assure that these kosher certification costs are when spread over all products produced ie products sold ending inventory and spoilage are so small that they do not enter corporate financial statements In accounting and auditing terms these kosher certification costs are not material

Unless you are a financial analyst cost accountant auditor or CFO these kosher certification costs should be of no concern to the consumer

Meals and entertainment costs corporate aircraft costs and other extravagant costs commonly incurred by these companies that I have done accounting work for are objectively obnoxious and material in that they show up as a line item on financial statements whereas kosher certification costs are so immaterial that they are lumped together with other marketing costs
