 Thmc1  1736317693 sill sockpuppeting  REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person blocked sockmaster Thmc1 is still block evading by not logging in even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs1736317693 7488160244 as well as IPs used by his other blocked account Nyc88 and any other accounts affiliated wthem Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings To make matters worse he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigationevidence   

No clue  links would be helpful   

Actually I think its the other way around if Im not mistaken I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue Are you stocking this address Is this some sort of retaliation First of all I have no idea who any of these other users are much less others who use this IP address 1736317693  
Hmm Thanks I think hadnt noticed the 173 above was the same as the 173 I just talked to  still no clue why MBaxter showed up here Aw well  keep on keepin on   

Vsmith Dont let 1736317693 fool you It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 7488160244 That IP was found to be one of 1736317693s sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation 1736317693 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1 blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010 Even though 1736317693 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1s sockpuppet he was let off with a warning For the full story I suggest that you check out Thmc1s most recent investigation August 2012 The final assessment was one account Nyc88 permanently blocked one IP temporarily blocked and one left open with warning If he causes you anymore trouble you should report this to the SysAdmins and dont hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010 He has an antiUK bias amongst many and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1   Preceding undated comment added  

Hantavirus
VSmith I actually came to your talk page for a different reason and just happened to notice this It looks ridiculous and I think this MBaxter1 character is highly suspicious himself In the meantime can you please look at this story seen on the main CNNcom page today httpwwwcnncom20120905healthhantaviruswarningsindexhtmlhpthp_t1
I think that this Yosemite hantavirus story is worthy of at least brief mention in the article because it is now having international implications I just dont see a justification in ignoring it completely thanks1736317693  

Does the article have a current events section The hantavirus bit isnt history and as it is notable it should be discussed on the hantavirus page  havent checked And no dont think we need a current events section on the page  WPnotnews  User talkVsmi
