This thread is a continuation of Possible misunderstanding by Bill OReilly does not belong in article section above so Ive moved the Retaliatory Massacres section up and made this thread a subhead under Possible misunderstanding   Talk 

There have already been many comments in favour of taking the OReilly content out of this article and some comments in favour of keeping it there  It looks to me like a consensus but not unanimity in favour of deleting the OReilly reference altogether  Any proponents of keeping an OReilly reference care to state that case in light of the whole discussion  Also everyone please remember to sign your contribution with four tildes      Talk
