Government section cleanup 

The government section has a few problems First most obvious is that it doesnt mention the government The cabinet or executive as its variously known Thats probably pretty important to know what the superagencies are Second is that it doesnt mention local government Local government is pretty big in California and there is no mention of special districts anywhere in the article Third capital punishment is given more detail than any branch of the government Thats POV pushing Capital punishment is just one aspect of the law If we are going to keep it we should seriously consider adding in other criminal law aspects But I think thats best left for the politics section or other articles Fourth the elections information is just plain wrong Since Proposition 14 California only uses partisan primaries for political party officials in presidential primaries and county central committees which are not government officials
