wikipedia entry on tenstring guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on tenstring guitar from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the information presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10string guitar both being littered with inaccuracies and even deliberate misinformation 

For the time being I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudomusicologists on wikipedia It is however a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to the tenstring guitar that is wikipedia and Janet Marlows tenstringguitardotcom are riddled with inaccuracies untenable claims and as shown in a previous blog even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepess words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter

Since Ive spoken out about this disinformation I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms 10string guitar or tenstring guitar Some of our American colleagues evidently dont like the truth coming out about their dishonest scholarship

As for wikipedia be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the tenstring guitar page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading tenstring guitar sites The person presently responsible for the from a musicologicalorganological point of view misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder whose musical expertise as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church Yet he too deems himself an authority who is in a position to educate readers about the 10string guitar an instrument he has no doubt never played  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for making kids dumb and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online encyclopaedia for research
