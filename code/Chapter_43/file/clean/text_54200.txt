I can see your argument against disambiguation I personally like having the disambig page but that may be because Im predisposed to like them I could go either way on it so if you want to leave it without a disambig page thats fine I still think we should rename them both though for clarity we can just have the main MT page redirect to the most recent one I personally think Moshe Teitelbaum Ujhel and Moshe Teitelbaum Satmar are the best since years of birth and death are rarely search terms while city of residence may be However if outvoted it doesnt matter too much in the long run
