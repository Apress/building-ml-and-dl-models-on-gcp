The appearance seems to depend both on the browser and the window size and Ive been fiddling with the image placement to try to balance them  I dont like the block quote template as it doesnt seem to do anything and I prefer quotes of this sort to stand out typographically in some way  The quote in this case seems to have a Dickensian sound to it which provides a sense of the period  Im hoping that the readership will like it but critics abound alas  Anyway thanks for your input
