Alyxs injuries
Ive noticed a tendency to describe Alyx as fatally wounded and mortally wounded by the hunter in Episode 2 She is neither as those two terms are used to describe injuries resulting in death and Alyx does not die To say she is gravely wounded is the accurate term or seriously wounded if someone really wants to play letter of the law with NPOV I played the game again recently and no one on screen makes any reference to Alyx actually being dead and brought back to life at least not as a result of the hunter incident She is described as being near death thats all
