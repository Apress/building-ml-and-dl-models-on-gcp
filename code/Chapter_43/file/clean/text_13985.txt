Although it was deleted I may still bring it back But following comments from the GA reviewer I tried to break down the Rolling Stock section which meant I mainly left the HST section and moved the refurbishment section to a new refurbishment section and the formation section was deleted I may re word the HST section sometime soon to incoporate the main parts of the Formation section it must be noted that this is the only Company that has this much detail on Rolling Stock If I bring it back I can copy and paste it from the edit history which is built in to wikipedia I will probably incoporate the most useful parts
