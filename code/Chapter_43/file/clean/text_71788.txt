Undo Talkpage protection 

Lets get this straight Question Why was the talk page protected Answer To keep me away from it

Since Im still here then keeping the talk page protected didnt serve its purpose and doesnt serve a purpose

Also the reason given for keeping me of the talk page was extremely unfair here I was deleting Personal attacks from another editor and it was claimed that I was simply deleting comments and Nothing was done about the personal attacks from that editor except of course protect the talk page so theyd be guaranteed to stay

Protecting a talk page like this can have negative effects on the article itself since IP users are not able to participate in discussions regarding the article and its contents
