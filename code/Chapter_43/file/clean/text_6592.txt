1 Please remain civil  You may have a personal relationship with the subject or have personal reasons for supporting him but taking personal offence on his behalf isnt useful to improvement of the article  2 You keep conflating my changes with those of someone else  The use of the word caused appears to be the major source of your dudgeon and I didnt make that change  You keep reverting all changes wholesale  including changes made for reasons purely of style  rather than picking out the ones which are bothering you  3 We have no proof that the documents are sensitive or that Bradley Manning is responsible for anything at all since there has been no legal action  You complain about BLP but accepting claims about Bradley Mannings guilt in the matter of a serious criminal offence are an extremely serious BLP policy violation  Until the claims of Lamo and the US government have been established in a court of law we CANNOT use the wordofGod to state their claims are true  As for the torture citation if you read the article and many others also easily obtainable you will see that its the newspaper which chose to put torture in quotation marks not the experts they consulted  We are not interested in the editorial opinion of the newspaper but rather the opinion of the experts whom the newspaper has consulted  who clearly states that Mannings treatment amounts to torture
