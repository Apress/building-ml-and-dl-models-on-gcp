If people insist on placing the version of the UK arms used in Scotland in the infobox to symbolise Scotland then perhaps theyd be good enough to alter the info box at England and Wales and argue their case for change at those articles also Furthermore so as to avoid any confusion why not change the name of this article to Scotland United Kingdom just so as to avoid any possible confusion 

Would those pushing for change like to alter the Kingdom of Scotland article info box to reflect the arms used up to 30th April of 1707 also
