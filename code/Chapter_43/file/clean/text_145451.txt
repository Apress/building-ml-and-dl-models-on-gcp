Well as for reliable sources its basicly the word of the government of Iran and all professional media in the country V the word of some rioters The reliability of both could be disputed whats clear is that as they are the conflicting sides here both should be represented which isnt happening As for the fact government employees were given the day off it should be included but the way in which it was included was not neutrally phrased As for source 17 according to WP policies blogs belonging to major newspapers can be used as source however since the writer of this blog is clearly extremely biased his biased views should not be put in that way into the article Now my problem is nto with the reliability of the LATimes but with the fact that this man was completely baselessly labelled as a plainclothed policeman while there is no proof of that at all The blogger claims this because of seeing an amateur video but how do any of us know he is an undercover policeman He could be an angry government supporter he could be a terrorist he could be a random gunman he could be an agent of the CIA or even the Iranain Green Movement itself sent to open fire for propaganda reasons Who knows It should just not be reported like that especially since the government has denied opening fire on protestors and this video is being used in this article to prove them wrong
