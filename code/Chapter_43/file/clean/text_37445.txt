Mamas Family edit

I myself was confused and didnt even know Eunice the movie had a page until yesterday when I clicked that Eunice link to be directed to the character page but realized it was for a movie I actually follow the Mamas Family pages closely and was surprised to learn the Eunice movie has had a page for nearly a year I have tried to resolve the matter by putting in a clarification in italics If you still take issue well have to open up the debate on the talk page to third and fourth parties but were not allowed to continually revert each other And since youd be the first to break the 3revert rule I am just warning you that youd be the one in danger of being blocked
