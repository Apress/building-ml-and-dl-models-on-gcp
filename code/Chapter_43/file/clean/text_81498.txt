Doug Wellers prejudice against Richard Bradshaw Watson II  Science 7 Seals as beyond Einstein theories 

I referred to the scientist Brad Watson and his discoveries of 7 cuttingedge theories that he claims are the 7 Seals on the cover of his booklet There Are No Coincidences  there is synchronism design and alignment I see that Watson has posted on this article and talk page before Not more than 60 seconds elapsed before Doug Weller came along and not only deleted Science 7 Seals as beyond Einstein theories from the article he deleted it from this talk page Thats against the rules of Wikipedia as I understand them The scientific explanation of the 7 Seals appears to me to be much more logical legitimate and a 21st century interpretationexplanation than anything else in this article It belongs here in the Wikipedia article and thats why I put it here In a message to me he attacks Richard Bradshaw Watson II and says not to use him as a source anymore Thats outrageous Theres a strong prejudice coming from Doug Weller and its doing a great harm to this very important Wikipedia article and talk page  Einstein 7574130115
