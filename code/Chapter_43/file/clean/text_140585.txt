In 1912 long before Landis Cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended The fan was indeed handicapped but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb who wouldnt put up with it His teammates went on a oneday strike then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didnt Cobb did not escape suspension he served it The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid1920s came from another ballplayer about a game several years earlier It was that one players word against theirs hence insufficient evidence Landis didnt hesitate to punch out the big stars like Ruth when it seemed warranted The stats for Jackson in the 19 Series dont suggest he did anything much to help his team win I dont know that he denied throwing the Series some sources claim that But did he keep the money Far as I know he did There is a rule that banned players cant be in the Hall because their actions are ON THE FIELD and are a stain on the game
