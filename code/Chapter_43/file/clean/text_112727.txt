Hello  I introduced a  tag to that particular claim because source cited in the body of the article neither does mention 1982 nor 1984 Im not sure what do you mean by great editor We are all same trying to improve Wikipedia I see you left an edit summary that AAA article says so thats why it should be included in the article BBB Ill request you to see WPCIRCULAR If you got some reliable source that says 1982 or 1984 or any other year feel free to make required changes For referencing help see referencing for beginners Regards  Lets talk
