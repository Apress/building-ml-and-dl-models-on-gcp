I did not know that Erbacan was also in the Turkish government in 1974 In any case every turkish politician is within the kemalistic ideology since noone criticising or rejecting or judging this ideology but they all accept it Taksim can as well have this link The Megali Idea was not that simple as establishing a Greek state that covers all the Greeks as u said The Greeks of Pontus Southern Italy former southern Serbia modern FYROM Eastern Rumelia Alexandria Cyprus where excluded Yes Megali Idea shares similarities with Enosis thats why the link is present in that article but adding Megali Idea and excluding Kemalistic Ideology from Taksim seems at least weird cause Kemalism is much more relevant with Taksim than Megali Idea could ever be Regards
