Thanks for Pomaks I hope that PMK1 will agree that this alternative name is a fact As for your example with Lipka Tatars its interesting and let see how it is applicable in our case
As I see the only argue was about the title of the article  Lithuanian Tatars or Lipka Tatars In fact in the artice is clearly explained that The name Lipka is derived from the old Crimean Tatar name of Lithuania It was chosen the name by Tatar origin Lipka as a title but the alternative name is mentioned in the text I didnt noticed some argues or evidences that there are alternative names as Russian Tatars Ukrainian Tatars Latvian Tatars Concerning Polish Tatars it is mentioned in the text Polish Tatars and PolishLithuanian Tatars It would be interesting to look about some sources about hypothetical existing of such alternative names Russian Tatars Ukrainian Tatars Latvian Tatars in the past or in the present I am sure that if they exist we can add this useful information in the article It would be very good test for our case too However until then the good example with this group is hypothetical
