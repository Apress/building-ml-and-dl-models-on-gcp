Revertion of comments about 1985 Wyatt expeditions  dowsing device 

Since one of my friends disappeared in mysterious circumstances leaving his tent and personal effects behind from an expedition while investigate a Noahs Ark hoax I bring a certain need for academic or even journalistic accuracy to the subject

In particular I have become aware of evidence about the device used in the 1985 Wyatt survey  and had posted a critical comment  with supporting links to Creation Magazine

This was reverted without comment  see history

Since these facts are now widely accessible on the internet how can the redactors of this page justify leaving the article giving half the story of the 1985 Wyatt expedition
