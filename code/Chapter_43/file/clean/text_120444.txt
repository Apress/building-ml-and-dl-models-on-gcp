WikipediaArticles for deletionSuri Cruise 2nd nomination  

Hello  You previously voted in the 2006 AfD for Suri Cruise  At the time Suri was less than 10 days old and the ultimate verdict was to turn the article into a redirect to her mothers page

Since then Suri has become much more notable in her own right as a toddler fashion icon with over 13 million hits on google image search  After getting an administrator to lift the protection on the redirect I recently restored the article as a stub but an editor who believes that 6 year olds are not inherently notable has again requested deletion

If its not too much trouble Id appreciate your making your opinion known at WikipediaArticles for deletionSuri Cruise 2nd nomination
