I could ask this on the project talk page but Im probably just misisng a few obvious things Please let me know your thoughts on these
 Via the AFC category pages Ive encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are NOT under review at this time Is that a bug I felt like it was wasting my time
 Similarly a few that had already been declined
 Im pretty up on WP policies Ive done thousands of edits created a few articles myself participated in consensus building and adminassisted special ops etc However Im finding it hard to deal with the Gnn reason codes and WikiProject templates Any advice Is this something that should really be in the script
 What do we do with Sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed even though they are in a review status Im not sure how they got there to begin with For example I saw a page that was obviously intended to the User main page once he got his broken English repaired and it was far from complete yet it somehow had come into AfC Really dont know how Any idea how it got to us Or what to do about any such article in review
I did approve one article but Im not sure I did two things correctly for it a I did some minor obvious content cleanup extraneous headings on a stub hide TOC on stub move infobox to top b I saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject a book series AFter I approved it I edited the automatic message on the users talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one Were these two actions god bad or indifferent

If you think these questions belon in the project talk page fel free Honestly I think this project is begging for a newreviewerFAQ And maybe some screenshot tutorial
