Personnaly I wouldnt complain if VVVVV singlehandedly reworked the article and actually made it better I would complain however and I would accuse him of dominating it if as usual he reworked the article only in order to put his own views and theories into the article or if he adopted a nonencyclopedical style only to start yet another editwar if anyone dared to touch his holy contributions I would complain if VVVVV tried again to threaten me to force me out of Wikipedia for standing in his way ie respecting the No OR policy and indeed if VVVVV were to do that I would consider it downgrading the article and article ownership Because that is what VVVVV is doing here So he can touch whatever article he wants but any violations of the rules will be reverted and Im tired of seeing him throw tantrums everywhere about people destroying his work when hes obviously determined to have his own way on WP and to ignore every existing guideline and policy and to attack everyone reminding him that articles about Evangelion dont belong to him
