Perhaps the way forward is to include both the raw figures and also the rate per 100000 these figures represent As for the conclusion I went for the conclusion in the introductory synopsis as it was a clear statement of the outcome of the research  I didnt add this study to the article but when I read it it is clear that it is relevant to the discussion as it provides evidence of correlation between abortion and suicide but as we all know correlation does not prove causation Cheers
