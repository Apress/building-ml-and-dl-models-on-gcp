Consensus regarding name

I have seen in this article there is an issue of consensus regarding the name Let me shed some light on the same

1 Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra sect just like Pope is to Christanity Since calling the Pope Pope John Paul is allowed in Wikipedia the name Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin should also be allowed Here Syedna is the word used instead of Pope Furthermore just like the Pope Syedna is also placed before only one person in the world in Dawoodi Bohra community Just like Pope it indicates leadership So by not allowing to use it would amount to discrimination on the part of Wikipedia and its editors and administrators and other authorities towards a minority sect 

2 All the verifications in Wikipedia is done on the basis of media references and in the entire media Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin is refered to as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin

I would like to request the editors to please do not confuse yourselves by the issues raised by people with less knowledge regarding this article and resolving the issue of name move ahead and concentrate on improving the content of the article 

I apologise if i have been short and to the point in the explaination it really isnt worth elaborating it is so simple to understand Thank you
