Alternative Leyte as disambiguation page In my experience and thanks to the WWII battles the island and the gulf are the primary topics  plural for Leyte I think that in this case our readers would be better served by having Leyte as the disambiguation page and all specific content just one click away  Such an arrangement would have the added advantage of facilitating the work of editors and general maintenance checking SpecialWhatLinksHereLeyte would suffice to know which wikilinks need correction thus further aiding in ensuring that our readership gets a better content across Wikipedia and not just in this specific article
