I must admit that I am quite surprised and even slightly entertained by the discussion about the urban area Anyway I will not throw oil at this fire I like the compact infobox and if more info needs to be displayed into a table format then why not create a Paris portal I would like to correct a slight misconception raised by Captain scarlet images can actually be added to infoboxes and thats one thing that I have been doing recently for a number of the French communes My comments to the current infobox
 if there is no intercommunality could we just add none
 why are there 2 figures for the land area I guess that it is about the forests areas but the not does not seem to link anywhere
 is Paris actually technically a commune
 there is a typo at Cooridinates
Otherwise good job folks
