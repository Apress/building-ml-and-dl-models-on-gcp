Thanks Director IP90 People constantly changing sourced text in articles because they have a view about ethnicity is very annoying and the words are not illchosen they reflect the everyday facts of WP article on Balkans subjects Every week I and dozens of other editors probably revert a dozen editors who have a particular view about what language code should be used in some article or another and its just POV nonsense Your initial edit was just another example of carte blanche changes made without reference to the sourced material in the article Now you have looked at it you obviously have realised that the sources use Bosnian Muslims not Bosniaks This is the case with almost all scholarly texts on WW2 Yugoslavia You can insist on whatever you like but I certainly have no issue with identifying the commonly used modern ethnic affiliation of Bosniaks in the lead just as I have no issue with identifying what the modern states are called   send over
