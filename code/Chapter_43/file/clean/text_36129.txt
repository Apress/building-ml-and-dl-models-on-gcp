Actually Nin Einne is right Ill try to explain why First thing all scientific information ie somewhat accurate info should be publically verifyable where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that Now if you cite some source like in the example above it says blah blah near dailycitation number Unlike what you might think that does not mean that the sentence blah blah near daily is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion What the phrase blah blah near dailycitation number actually means is in citation number someone claims blah blah near daily which youll agree is fully correct After all that is whats written there and anyone can look at the source because its public and read what is says verifyable Now if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily that is fine But how should you go about it  One thing you can not do change the sentence and leave the citation Because then it would mean in citation number someone claims blah blah daily That is not true If you look at the source youll see it says blah blah near daily Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out Of course it can happen that whats written in the source is not accurate But that doesnt mean you have the right to change it as you did
What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one You could write It has been reported that blah blah near dailycitation number but I think that blah blah daily The moment you do this however youll find that people will object because what you have presented is not publically verifyable So what is needed here is a source a pointer to publically verifyable information to support your claim The full list of newspapers would be ok but very unpractical If there is a single list somewhere preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent that would be much easier
You might think its much more important to tell the truth accurately even if you dont find a source because after all the truth is what its all about Unfortunately there is no such thing as the truth a universally and unanimously accepted version of events and certainly not in the IsraelianPalestian conflict Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page and what the page would then look like So we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information Strange as it may seem it works even when not perfectly accurate the result will not stray to far from the truth if there is any one such thing and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar
