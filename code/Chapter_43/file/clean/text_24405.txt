Exactly I dont own Wikipedia or have the authority to randomly delete articles We have discussions then we build consensus Thats why Im discussing you here other possibilities such as merging these battles to related articles Please do not take offense as I sense a change in your tone To answer your question
We require multiple sources so that we can write a reasonably balanced article that complies with WikipediaNeutral point of view rather than representing only one authors point of view This is also why multiple publications by the same person or organization are considered to be a single source for the purpose of complying with the multiple requirement WPWHYN
Lack of multiple sources suggests that the topic may be more suitable for inclusion in an article on a broader topic It is common for multiple newspapers or journals to publish the same story sometimes with minor alterations or different headlines but one story does not constitute multiple works Several journals simultaneously publishing different articles does not always constitute multiple works especially when the authors are relying on the same sources and merely restating the same information Similarly a series of publications by the same author or in the same periodical is normally counted as one source WPGNG footnote 3
I appreciate your work Truly I do Thats why I didnt AfD them right ahead I wanted to have a thorough consultation with you being a longtime editor after all Have a good day I wish you reconsider
