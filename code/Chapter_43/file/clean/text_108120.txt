Biography

Offenbachs father Isaac Juda Eberst born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802Yon JeanClaude Jacques Offenbach Editions Gallimard Paris 2000

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict

  
Thank you that sounds good although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote but maybe thats just me One more thing the italics around his fathers name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped    

 Play titles 
Confusingly in other stage works three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same case as given in the articles about the plays   
Can you clarify There are no red links in that section zach 
There arent any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles Cg2p0B0u8ms observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used Other projects are not so strict thats why those articles on the plays use a different spelling    
Ah Missed that Shouldnt we be using the English titles After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below zach 
Wouldnt that make for an awkward list as we dont have English titles for all these plays    
Perhaps but then what is the least bad solution My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first  at least within the article zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph  shrug Whatever no biggie The list itself is a useful improvement to the article in whichever language the titles are listed    

Yes its not a major thing From WikipediaManual_of_Style_France_26_FrenchrelatedWorks_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of lAcadémie française  into Grove no problem    
Also visual arts but as we have often remarked this is a classic nowin situation zach
