South Asia protection request 

I saw your protection request for South Asia though another admin acted on it  I thought Id let you know a little more about the issue as Im pretty sure why Fastily declined it  In general semiprotection is used only when an article is regularly being vandalizedusually regularly means no less than once every few days  Looking at the history of South Asia I see only about 1 vandalism edit per week which is not enough to justify semiprotection  In fact in all of August I only see one revert for vandalism plus I see productive edits by unconfirmed editors   There are exceptions that might cause a page to be protected with less negative activity like when the edits arent just vandalism but also defamatory to living people per WPBLP but that doesnt apply here I hope that helps explain why that page shouldnt be protected at this time
