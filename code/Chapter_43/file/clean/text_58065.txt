AL Thanks for the  advice The precision of the premises cannot really justify the precision of the 8625 result 3 decimal places I have reduced it to a precision of 1 decimal place 86 That is in accord with standard mathematical tolerance error principles I believe the precision of a multiplication cannot be better than the least precision of the factors I have also added the word approximately This is because the rule of thumb factor of 25 is admitted to be roughly accurate in the source Its actually 2543 but that is only implied not stated
