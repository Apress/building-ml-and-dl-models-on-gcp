Beati 

I started after singing it today Beati quorum via Stanford which has been compared to Bruckners motets Expansion welcome  I have little time Also we have CategoryPsalm settings and CategoryPsalmrelated compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach but miss CategoryPsalmrelated compositionswhich would be more appropriate for a setting of just one verse of 176 Psalm settings should be reserved for settings of one complete psalm or several
