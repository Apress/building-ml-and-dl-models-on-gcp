Philosopher RFC 
philosopher from Wiktionary A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career Note Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place

 Definitions 
Obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing Some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent Using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims If we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability  this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to
