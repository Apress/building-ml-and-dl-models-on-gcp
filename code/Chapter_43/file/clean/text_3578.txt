Corinne I was replying to your comment that I think articles on animals and birds and insects are much more interesting than articles on plants and fungi but Ill do those too I also really like articles on geology mining and environmental topics Im saying that sounds fine go ahead and do them at TFA To see what support on prose means click on WPFAC and then search for that phrase Youll see that Ive offered something called support on prose for many of the articles currently up at FAC Looking at what Ive done should explain it better than I can  Dank push to talk
