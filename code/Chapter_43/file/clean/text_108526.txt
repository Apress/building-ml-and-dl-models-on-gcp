I have sent the following complaint to wiki
Please take a look at the history of the following page and decide for yourself whether the blocking is warranted httpenwikipediaorgwikiUser_talkDining_philosopherBlanking_at_5B5BAndhra_Pradesh5D5D
I am blocked from editing by
InShaneee httpenwikipediaorgwikiUserInShaneee
who is probably acting in collusion with
Ragib httpenwikipediaorgwikiUserRagib

The reasons given were the following
personal attacks vandalism ect

Will the administrator please explain what acts of personal attacks and vandalism I am guilty of I believe that these administrators lack good judgement and dont deserve their priviliges Blocking is a weapon that is too powerful to be put into the hands of such juveniles sorry but thats the truth

Could you kindly tell me what are the racist comments I made Also please take a look at the following page
httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaRequests_for_adminship
which clearly states that
Administrators must be courteous and exercise good judgment and patience in dealing with others
Clearly this is a power trip for you and And by administrator you mean me The guy who WILL be blocking you for longer  is far from courteous and exercise good judgment and patience especially while dealing with a novice
