That statement is almost entirely wrong from top to bottom  No from a policy standpoint it is not worse except for biographies of living persons countries are not living people cannot be libelled hence the invention of the  template which you chose not to use hence it being destructive  Ive added references for a handful of select nations because they are the ones that joined after independence  Almost all the rest joined at independence so it is academic to show their join date  I have added information above and beyond what is on the Commonwealth Secretariats site because said site is not a repository for all the information in the world on the Commonweath are we saving space s that the inane continent field can be included  The last point that the opinion of a single user constitutes a consensus is a bizarre misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy  yet again

I will also finally suggest that you a make better use of edit summaries rather than claiming that deletion of what took me a long time to create in the first place is cleaning up and b read my edit summary before inferring that I intended to hurt your poor feelings  destructive does not mean evil but that some information has been lost which was NOT conveyed in your obfuscatory edit summary
