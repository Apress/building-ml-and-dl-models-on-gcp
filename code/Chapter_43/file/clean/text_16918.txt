Concerning Mesić this is not just one poll I am talking about there were many Every so often the news publish the results of the various agencies that researched this phenomenon These polls do not repeat do not center on the capital They are highly professional and reliable and in each one Mesić was voted the most popular Need I also mention the ultimate poll of all the presidential elections two of them in fact both of which he won as an independent candidate and did not rely on the support of any party Furthermore I find the idea that football hooligans represent the Croatian people highly offensive as opposed to for example university students I also do not know where you get the idea that the entire Croatian national football team is extreme rightwing that is not the case
I imagine you must have come into contact only with certain circles of Croatian society Perković generally draws his support from the rather rural parts of Croatia and from people that hail from such warstricken and undeveloped areas Modern prowestern central urban areas far from supporting the Great Patriot Perković are the source of the many recent protests against him Ive not known him on a personal level for years so I cannot say whether or not he really cares about the Croatian people I do know that professing eternal love for the holy soil of Croatia is absolutely essential for his cash flow though Quite frankly I do not care about whether he really loves Croatia all I know is that he is the public focal point of a backward nationalist mentality that has claimed far too many victims and destroyed far too many economies around here I dare say it is a little too easy to support such a mentality from a distance where its primitivistic repercussions cannot be felt  TALK 1145
