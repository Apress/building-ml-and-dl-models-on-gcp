Wikipedias community is really just explaining how Wikipedia works If the Wikipedia article is too big to describe such a fundamental concept as our editors then we should move other things to a second page if we have to Separating the article just doesnt make any sense to me

The Wikipedia community can easily be defined by ones perspective and isnt something we can just tie down to some specifics A separate article will likely encourage a false impression of what the community actually is
