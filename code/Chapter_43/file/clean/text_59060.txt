POV vs NPOV 
Hi from the Arab Israeli Conflict page  Ive noticed you just removed a statement about Palestinian refugees and marked it deleted because of POV  I just wanted to let you know that NPOV means that that many POVs are presented on Wikipedia in a neutral non judgemental way  it doesnt mean that critical points of view are not presented as long as they are accurate and can be cited  I note that there have been some disputes about some of your additions and deletions and this might be something to help you work more peacefully in future
