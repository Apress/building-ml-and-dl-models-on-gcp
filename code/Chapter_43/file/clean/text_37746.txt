Flawed statements in the Daniels article 

The same day he decertified all government employee unions by executive order removing the requirement that State employees be union members a requirement that had been in place since Governor Evan Bayh required by executive order in 198926

This statement is incorrect The Executive Order that Bayh passed did not require employees to join the union nor were they ever required to join Also the order was passed in 1990 so it is pretty much factually incorrect Here is the link to Executive Order 0335 which reprints the original executive order and extends it during Kernans governing time period They were required to pay at most 85 of union dues due to courtcase Nass v State which I am also including a link to However they were not technically members of the union simply covered by their collective bargaining agreements

I would alter it myself however Im unfamiliar with creating footnotes with Wikipedia
