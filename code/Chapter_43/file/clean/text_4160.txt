 So vote on a consensus on a questionable and corporate watchdog site 
The problem is that you are giving more validity to a 1 person managed website that is hardly corroborated than a credible site like Global Security Federation of American Scientists CNBC Yahoo  That website does not belong on the site  I would accept controversy but the problem is that it needs to be corroborated  You cant put a website that accuse Dick Cheney of a secret plot against the President based on a site like Rense for example  You want to support lunancy  This isnt your soapbox to do so
