Cheesr I will not rant here but you have answered the question Does the Deragotis blog cite any sources Is the Deragotis article anything but a independant blog Once again it provides no sources Answer the question If no then it should be removed according the very rules provided by Wikipedia Answer that for me

The answer as to your statement that a source can speak about things in history at any time is certainly true but we are talking about things in our very lifetime when newspapers magazines have proliferated everywhere in America For you to expand the scope to comparing DC EMO of the 80s to an an event orwhatever tothe year of the Normans invading The British Isles is a classic sophistry FOr the reasons stated above in this context 

I am simply saying that your relying strictly on a criterion set forth on Wikipedia to hamper what others feel it EMO Scene really is in fact undermintes the very article on Wikipedia on EMO as it is 

Am I ranting or am I recting facts The Deragotis article is merely exhibit A You have not refuted my contention at all
