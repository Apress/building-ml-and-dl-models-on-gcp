Help 

Hello Roger
Im the new Wikipedia registrant who added the Mahiole link on which you commented  Another Wikipedia editor Simple Bob deleted this and other contributions I added claiming them as spam  Im confused as to why since all of my links were contentrelevant to the pages in which they appeared  
Can you look into this  I understand the need for vigilance against spam on Wikipedia but feel Simple Bob was in error to treat me as a spammer  Im not selling or promoting anything simply linking to information on pages which are lacking in adequate citation
Thanks r
