I guess maybe I didnt do a good job of communicating the issue to you  I realize that ImagePalermoDJPG and ImagePooNinjajpg are of the users by the same name  What I am concerned about especially for your photo is who took the photo  If it was a professional photography agency then they most likely retain copyright which means you cant put it on Wikipedia T
