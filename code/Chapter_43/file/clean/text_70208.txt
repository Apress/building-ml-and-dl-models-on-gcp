This is a Bio about a church pastor who served his congregation loyally for 20 years and had an indiscretion  big deal  It reminds me of Clinton and Lewinski  so what that he fooled around  HIS PRIVATE LIFE  had nothing to do with his ability to help others  Just because Haggard wanted to romp around with some guys getting his jollies off another mans sewer spout doesnt mean he is a bad pastor  Had he been a CEO of a company or just a normal working man  Big deal  who would care  This article I am certain is being used to stomp all over him and kick him around like a dog  WP says not allowed  This bio is nothing more than an attack page AFAIAC
