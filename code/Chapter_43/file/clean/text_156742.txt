You seem not to understand the logic here  Try to focus or try not to focus whatever works for someone with your peculiar situation  The SOURCE was DCRTVcom and the information was that DC101 had REPORTED something  The source was reliable and implicitly accepted as such by you and the REPORT of DC 101s report was moreover true  This is entirely in accord with Wikipedias rather Stalinesque guidelines on secondary sources which MOST EMPHATICALLY DO NOT require that what the source reports be true although in this case it was DC 101 reported that the Greaseman was dead  By the way as you know your ears constitute original research and therefore mean precisely DICK  Im right youre wrong give up and go feed your cats or whatever it is you do
