I have read that particular book and Im confused by what you say Of course the film jumps from person to person the progression is of ideas not poeple to be interviewed which allows for a cohesive meaning to the film In fact the film presents information very similar to that of the book in question except it is not essentially a propaganda piece aimed at one particular medium but an expos√© of an industry targeted at the practices of several media
Im also a writer and a prodigous reader I had read most of Seuss childrens work by the time I was three most of Dahls childrens stories by the time I was six and read The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve I was in the tenth percentile of the state in my final year of school literature exam When you can read Metamagical Themas The Silmarillion and The Gods Themselves at the same time and take any meaning away from them you can have a go at being condescending  1736
