consider for renaming the the title of the Ashoka article to Ashoka the Great
its not a matter of how majority of people in here believe its a matter of how people try to change the history 
with their corrupted power no wonder why most of colleges universities banned wikipedia as a reference source
its obvious there are a ton of bigots
