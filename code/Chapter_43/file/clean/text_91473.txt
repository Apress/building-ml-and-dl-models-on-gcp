Album Chronology 

Looking at several articles for Zappas albums it seems that the album chronology the part of the infobox that what albums come before and after that one is messed up Before I changed anything I wanted to get some opinions on exactly what the order should be I personally think we should follow the discography official album by official album though that still leaves things like the Birthday Bundles Beat the Boots Cheap Thrills Strictly Commercial etc out Any thoughts
