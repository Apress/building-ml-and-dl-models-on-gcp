Has anyone considered how matter the stuff we are all made from actually interact with time and time travel If I were to travel back in time would I be frozen and isolated in spacetime whilst everything else around me travel backwards in time or will I also physically and biologically travel back in time that is I get younger and younger and then disappear because I was not yet created thus defeating the Grandfather Paradox Although if it were possible for signals or information to travel backwards and forwards in time does this possibility automatically extend to matter as we know it ie particles giving rise to electrons protons and neutrons and ultimately biological beings such as ourselves  0230 30 July
