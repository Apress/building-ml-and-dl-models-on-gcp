Could you lend a hand 

Im trying to help out at Mami Wata which appears to be a neoancient spirit type topic  This is an area where I have a serious POV risk if I get too deeply involved  I liked what I saw of your work and openness to consideration of the evidence at WikipediaArticles for deletionEvan mythology and feel that you could be a helpful contributor  There is relevant discussion both at TalkMami Wata and User talkBrianSmithsonMami Wata  Vodou  Im asking you and two other editors I respect to come lend a hand hoping that having more participants in or at least eyes on the discussion will lead somewhere
