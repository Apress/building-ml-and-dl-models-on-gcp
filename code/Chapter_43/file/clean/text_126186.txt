FPC for USS Santa Fe 

I was under the impression that SNOW did not apply to FPCs yet I see mine was closed less than 24 hours after opening I feel that I have been cheated of my chance to obtain more information about the flaws of the picture from those who may have commented had the image been left out for a longer period of time At the very least a message informing me of the early closure of the FPC nom would have been nice  Talk
