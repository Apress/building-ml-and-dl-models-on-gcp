I like WMC Hes mostly a reasonable guy I dont like the way he treats folks  Ive tried to tell him  Ive tried to offer heart felt advice for him to improve  Really seems like everyone else posts there having nearly 400 followers Might defend him or challenge an admin to defend him  Might congratulate him on self improvements Might ask him for feedback on my drafts articles one day   wow just realized i am missing one For the most part I suspect he believes justice should serve him over serving all fairly  Really it is his selfish pride that is holding up ArbCom and article developments  It going to be best for him and others when he accepts his ignorance of the disruption he causes   

 Heres my WMC talk page history                 which seemed to have little effect guess I better change my ways
