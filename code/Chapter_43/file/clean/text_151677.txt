Not to worryjdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer 

I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100 accurate and verifiable I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians Jdorney uses two main sourcesCAIN and Lost Lives CAIN is a estimation at best and the US State Dept Janes Intelligence British  Human Rights Watch the Council On Foreign Relations and various books and articlesall take issue with CAINs facts and figures As for Lost Lives I have the latest edition of that book and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures If one reads carefully from 19692005 they see the number given as 86 shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units 85 of that number are given credit soley to the IRA I wonder if jdorney even has the book since he misquotes it so often Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Livesif one actually takes the time to read it throughly I am not going to respond to any more whiney and childish messages by jdorney I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased purposely innacurate Editors who ignore facts and make up their ownjust to support their own one sided views

PS Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants but I will not respond to them and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review

I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed by a editor who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer
