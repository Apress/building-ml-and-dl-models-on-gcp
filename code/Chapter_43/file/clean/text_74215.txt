I absolutely agree with the anonymous user There is absolutely no comparison between Winton and Schindler First of all Oscar Schindler was a true hero who saved thousands of people from imminent death by risking his life in the heart of the Nazi Germany With no unintended disrespect for MrWinton he merely sat in his hotel room and wrote ads to newspapers Secondly Schindlers heroism is widely recognized all over the world while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely wellknown for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished He is a purely mediamade hero And third of all the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended And judging by the numerous published cases of abuse of evacuated British children in their adoptive homes how those Czechoslovakian children were treated in their British homes would be an interesting investigation So I completely agree with the anonymous user Any comparisons between those two people should be removed from the article
