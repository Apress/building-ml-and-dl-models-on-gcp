an encyclopedia not an advertising forum  the person who wrote this article has not read the wikipedia Manual of style or there would not be this confusion

Ignorance and refusal to perform any research I think its almost the same sport only one person seems to be running one club and another person is running the other

Additional False and ignorant accusations I honestly dont care all that much I think you have a private club going here that is to the NFL or NASCAR what Football and Stock Car Racing are  you have a specific offshoot of a generic sport Except that there appears to be only one person running it  you And personal promotion and advertising even of a non profit corporation is not allowed on wikipedia So instead of your behavior

Ever more harrassment I believe that this article needs to be removed as it is clear that it is nothing more than mere personal promotion by one individual

Another false and ignorant statement based on a continued refusal to actually READ the article and educate oneself before talking The original article was NOT a sport This IS a horse sport article   

Continued Accusations  this time to turn your attack into a supposed defense  Kind of like North Korea or Saddam Hussien Um That is a personal attack

Continued ignorance on the subject advertising or personal promotion However I think that is precisely what you are doing with this article

More ignorance and attacking the person doing the work by accusing them of an attack article is all about one single persons little club and probably needs to be deleted as advertising But its also not a fight I care to fight because the individual who Owns the article viciously attacks anyone who attempts to help and refuses to listen to sound advice 

Just plain rude How about if people just correct the article instead of talking about it And how about if both of you anon IPs get user names so that you can more easily edit the article instead of sniping at each other

Yup None of that adds up to Harassment Not a word of it
