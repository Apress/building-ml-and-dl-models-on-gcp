I think it would be misleading to say that she was Georgian without clarifications Her name for one is definitely not Georgian Also if Georgian in this case simply refers to the country of provenance thats also misleading because at that time Georgia as a state formation did not exist With that logic it should say Azeri immigrant from the Russian Empire or lands recently annexed by Russia
