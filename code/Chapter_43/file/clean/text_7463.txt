Article revised for flow and minor corrections
I have made a start on editing the articles minor errors of grammar syntax and flow I hope this is acceptable to the other editors who have already done such a good job here Although I have changed the order of some of the information trying to lead from the general to the particular I have not removed any so far as I am aware I have added some details about the attack on the cornerstone ceremony I have also revised the numbers of aggressors and victims in this attack in line with those in the existing cited sources Im not sure where the articles original figure of 4000 Serbs came from Have I overlooked a reference  If so I apologize and ask that it be restored Anyway this change may well be temporary if someone can find other equally or more reliable souces

If the established editors here are unhappy with what Ive done please feel free to revert

I think the article could use quite a few more cites
