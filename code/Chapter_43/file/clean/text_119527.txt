Ownership Hardly I stand corrected in my error of attributing the added that Entwistle played to you As to original research if you view the article as it stood before I ever began to make my first entries and compare with what I added over time you will see that most of the article is actually comprised of my original research Virtually everything in the original article was in error I was the one who obtainedthrough my researchofficial documents such as her birth certificate and coroners report not the death certificate but the detailed reports that allowed the article accuracy regarding her given name dates of birth and death etc Moreover it was my research that uncovered newspaper articles regarding her time with Henry Jewett and the Boston Repertory her Guild tour and the quote from the San Fransisco interview So at what point are these primary sources no longer my original research but acceptable WP sources And as biographies are often used as sources in WP articles what happens when someone will wish to contribute and use my book as a referenceFrankly I no longer care what you all do with Entwistles article Do what ever the hell you want to it youre going to regardless of what I say or ask for you are a fanatical totally unreasonable lot And I find it interesting that neither of you addressed my concern as to why the article was fine for so long after Rossrs and Wildhartlivie and others helped to shape it into what had been deemed an article conforming to WP policies and guidelinesclearly the ownership of this article is Gwens
