The other justification given for the block was violation of a ruling in relation to user Asmodeus and user DrL I point out that I was accused of the very same violation for arguing that the deletion of the section that user Jimbo Wales shortly thereafter judged needed to be deleted On no occasion has it ever been explained in what way I have violated this ruling other than the statement that my edit pattern is similar to user Asmodeus I do not know what this means and nobody has tried to explain it It seems simply to be a means of intimidating editors
