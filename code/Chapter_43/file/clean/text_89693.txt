Can you or another experienced editor help then this is ridiculous all this guy is doing is assuming bad faith nothing i say or do can change that all he wants to do is throw bad faith accusations I would also like to see if you have a chnce where i do not have that authority from what i have read i do as long as it is used properlyHellinaBucket talk 

Never mind i see but this is getting out of hand do something about itHellinaBucket talk 

Does this look like a wikibreak

HellinaBucket leave me alone Im not editing the Operation Repo article or any article any longer you have no reason to contact me or ask anyone else to contact me on your behalf The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism Its true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning but dont let that embolden you The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days does not mean that you are not a vandal and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted such use does not constitute a personal attack You are a vandal You committed vandalism you repeated that vandalism and its only been a few days since then it doesnt wear off that quickly I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again but my goal was to stop you and everyone else from vandalizing the Operation Repo article I feel confident that I have succeed and I feel that the allegations of me overstepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable It is an added bonus that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor and I once again thankyou for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor HellinaBucket your account is only a month old why dont you just throw it away and make a new one Theres nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter read WPSOCK but the basic idea is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons If you just want to change your name or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again then thats fine Whether or not you get a new account there is no reason for you to contact me I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected Other than that I have no interest in that subjectVegKilla talk  HellinaBucket talk 

That would be the fourth or fifth time he has accused me of creating a new ACCT BAD FAUTH AND PERSONAL ATTACKS THAT IS CRAPHellinaBucket talk 

Im trying to enjoy my vacation but I couldnt resist pointing out that Anden is a brand new user The over the top language above could be Hellina arguing with themself or it could be anyone Personally I do not trust anyone trying to edit this article who created their account after the article was protected Also the first sentence of the article has issues with tenseVegKilla talk 

I adamatly deny HellinaBuckets allegations of me still directing personal attacks The only thing HellinaBucket said above that was true is that I have respect for Orangemikes opinion and I have no respect for HellinaBuckets warnings because not only did HellinaBucket initially leave me a level 4 warning skipping levels 13 but also I meet HellinaBucket by catching them in the act of vandalism I dont think anyone would respect warnings left by a 20day old account who is responding to being warned for vandalism came close to violating the threerevertrule and is skipping the first 3 warningsVegKilla talk THIS VANDALISM WAS BRINGING THE ARTICLE WITHIN THE STANDARDS OF WIKIPEDIA BTWHellinaBucket talk 

First accusied me of vandalising a page because i removed uncited material then he accused me of bad faith severaltimes and sock puppetry all this harrasmentr has happened and i did tery the approppriate ways warnings etc and all the user does is continue personal attacks
