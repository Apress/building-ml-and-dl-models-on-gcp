The utility of the source documents is aptly demonstrated by Tims citing the NSW survey dates as September 1990 and September of 1991 1992 and 1993  If he hasnt read them and cant even cite the dates of the survey correctly what hope is there for the average reader who has to come to grips with other issues such as the confounding with time of year  I would suggest broad summaries first then references to the details
