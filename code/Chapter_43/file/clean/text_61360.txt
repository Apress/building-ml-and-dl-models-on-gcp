   talk to me

 Your userpage does not exist so 

Hi  Ive noticed that you currently dont have a userpage Not a problem in itself but it makes your name appear as a redlink when signing talk pages or when seen in SpecialRecentchanges Some users feel that lack of a userpage is an indication that a user may be a troll sockpuppet or simply a newbie One simple solution if you dont want to create a userpage is to edit your userpage and insert the following

REDIRECT User talk

This will make your userpage a redirect to your talk page If you ever want to create a user page follow this link
