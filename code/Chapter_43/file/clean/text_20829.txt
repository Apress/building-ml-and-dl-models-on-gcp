You know nothing about the reality of Basque nationalism in Spain You probably do not know anything of the extremist and disparate principles of people like Sabino Arana and his racist theories And do not know anything about the linguistic theories of vascoiberismo which are one of the most important considerations related to Basque language

And also you are protecting absolutely unsustainable issues such as those undertaken Akerbeltz over the course of ethnic Catalans and Valencians held from blogs and pages themselves something prohibited in Wikipedia in all languages

In six years editing Wikipedia in Spanish Wikimedia Commons and other projects as anonymous and with my nick  I was never punished

Congratulations Mr
