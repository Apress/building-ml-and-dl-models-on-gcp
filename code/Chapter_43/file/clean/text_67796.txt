If it is a page you edited I or any admin can see the edits in your deleted contributions  If it was your own prior username subpage I can restore it and move it to your present user account  If it was someone elses I can restore it as well for use as evidence  Do you have a rough idea of the page name  If it relates to your prior user name you can email me if you prefer Thatcher
