First of all what mainstream historians say does not determine the truth Wikipedia claims to be NPOV factual and informative Allowing an allegedly mainstream POV to set the tone is a violation of NPOV especially when such opinions conflict with the facts
Second I note with interest that you havent disputed the substance of the extensive comments made by Capone and me Like Fred Bauder you concentrate on popularityin the limited context of wellfed Westerners who spent their youth searching for reds under the beds

Third you redbait those who claimcorrectlythat capitalism kills hundreds of millions of people every decade by withholding food clean water and basic medical care Calling this the Stalinist view of the world is a demagogues tactic

Fourth the US the UK France nonNazi Germany and other capitalist countries have indeed murdered millions upon millions of their own citizensor at least of the residents of their territory whether or not such people were regarded as citizens by the capitalist governments in question Need I mention the genocide that pushed the indigenous population of an entire hemisphere to the brink of extinction How about slavery revolution civil war conscription for military adventures abroad

Finally if you think that Stalin was a paranoid massmurderer is an NPOV statement that belongs in this or any other article there is no point in discussing anything with you  1811 29 Oct 2004 UTC
