RE  project dynamic 

Hi existence does not equate justification for the article to exist What Wikipedia is looking out for is notability through verifiability through reliable secondary thirdparty sources In other words your product will need to be wellcovered by the media eg PC World The New York Times or some respectable publication to be able to meet standards for inclusion on Wikipedia If you do have that please feel free to recreate the article including such sources Hope that answer your queries  Best regards
