Hello I created a new user name because I did not seem to be able to change the other user name Hayestradingco because of the block  If we cant merge the two usernames into one whayes12 then could we make the new user name whayes72  Sorry about the grief on policy violations It was not intentional  I was actually trying to create that post within the guidelines as I understood them But I obviously have a few things to learn about Wikipedia and needed to read more  whayes12 formerly known as Hayestradingco
