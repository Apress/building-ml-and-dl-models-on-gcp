Corsican nidicà  

Hi Perl I didnt know if youd seen the response to your question so I moved it here as the village pump is getting too large  2312 Mar 9 2004 UTC

On my userpage I include the Corsican proverb Quandu ellu canta lu cuccu Muta pèlu lu singhjari E la gallina faci lovu Senza mancu nidicà lu   This translates to When the cuckoo sings the wild boar changes skinpelt and the hen is able to lay an egg without the same  nidicà   I dont know what the Corsican word nidicà means and the quote doesnt make that much sense either Anyone know enough Corsican to help me out  1531 1 Mar 2004 UTC

Perhaps nest Nidus means nest in Latin and nid is nest in French  2147 1 Mar 2004 UTC
 Thats what my brother guessed this afternoon  I think that makes the most sense  The meaning of the proverb however still doesnt make sense to me  2158 1 Mar 2004 UTC

 I presume this proverb has something to do with the fact that the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest of another bird   0214 2 Mar 2004 UTC
