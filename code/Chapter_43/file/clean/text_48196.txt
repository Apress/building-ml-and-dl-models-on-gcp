i saw what you did and didnt realize the error i had made  i reverted it back to yours  Seems like u an Kww spend a lot of time together tag teaming other editors  I think the date of sentencing is important because it is the last but most important step of the criminal justice process  Plus people will want to know this  After he gets sentenced the language would of course need to be changed to the present tense and not the present future tense  But the info itself about her being a crime victim and of what crime is relevant  The fact that she is getting a large and disproportionate share of the restitution shows that she was the major victim here  Pics of her with dildos all over the place are pretty explicit
