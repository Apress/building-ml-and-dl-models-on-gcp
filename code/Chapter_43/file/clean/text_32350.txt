The portrayal of my reporting in Afghanistan and Iraq as embedded blogging is inaccurate 
I was never an embedded blogger in Iraq and Afghanistan my credential was always as a embedded journalist  

Over the past two years Ive reported for several news agencies both domestic and international

Although Ive written commentary for Fox Forums I have also written hard news for Foxnewscom  My beat is technology national security and of course the Iraq and Afghanistan wars

My credential as a journalist is issued Centcom the military command for both Iraq and Afghanistan area of operations  Please note Centcom does not have an embedded blogger credential 

I am also credentialed as a journalist for the United Nations and separately by Special ForcesCombined Joint Special Operations Task Force  Afghanistan  Qualification  The UN and Special_Forces_United_States_Army are fairly difficult credentials to obtain and being an embedded blogger would not suffice 

For the record Ive never been quoted hired or paid as a blogger  Ive always been quoted paid and hired as a journalist  Im not sure where the confusion comes from    

Id really appreciate if the editors corrected the record at Matt Sanchez
