Deleted Article 

Dear disconspinster
I do see youre a pretty efficient contributorfixer here in Wiki and wellrecognised as well but the article Interrelated Demand and Supply which you just deleted and redirected had additional information that was not present anywhere in Wikipedia at all which focuses on the definition of the different types of relationships for complementary goods

Of course the original stuff that i wrote on Interrelated Demand and Supply should probably go somewhere on Elasticity or Complementary Goods but i wanted to provide more information without sullying the neat and organized data on those above two pages so id created another page and hope someone tidies it up a bit and merges it with the other articles Didnt expect it to get deleted though Im going to revert the original back and hope someone with better economic knowledge will come along and merge it somewhere since Im new at this wiki formatting thing
