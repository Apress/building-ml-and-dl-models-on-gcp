Hi folks Im a visitor on this page but as i come from geomagnetic background there are a few things a would like to mention
1 the Earths magnetic field is NOT created by telluric currents It is created by currents in the liquid outer core as mentioned in an paragraph above but that are not telluric currents telluric currents are induced in the crust  mantle by electromagnetic waves from the atmosphere  due to thunderstorms eg or as mentioned in the article about telluric currents solar wind or currents in the ionosphere
changes of the main field that is the field generated in the deep interior are much to slow to induce currents in the crust or mantle they occur over time scales of years rather than days or even hours
if you have further questions dont hesitate to contact me reykogmxnet subject should include wikipedia
