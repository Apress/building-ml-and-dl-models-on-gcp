The True of this story
 
After having heard many users if in true are many and not a few posing as many asking me to see it from Wikipedias point of view or even from other users point of view I will give here my point of view lets see if someone has the courage to say heshe understands and the determination to stand out of the crowd
 
I was having a normal quiet Wikilife since a few weeks ago I joined groups I edited and was collaborating in the whole goal of Wikipedia
Yesterday I had a disagreement with user Durin at the talk page of user Demon about the validity of existing a category for users who have chosen to be nice to newcomers
One hour or less after user Durin coincidentally finds out that the humorous pictures I uploaded to my page all of which were my work and in good  tone are or so he said in other places in Internet 
I was told and was written since the first log by user Durin that I believe that I can download artwork from Internet and have rights on it
I requested immediate preventive deletion and I declared that the work is mine
I asked user Durin to tell me who and where is using my work that is where he saw it
User Durin said that the artwork was deleted and that is all the matter was closed
I informed user Durin that I needed to know where he saw my work so I could take legal steps against who was using my artwork
User Durin said absurdly that I was threatening him with legal action
I said in more than one message that the legal action referred to whom when and where was using my work not to him
User Durin started to say that I was harassing him
Some of Durins supporters who some may be alter egos showed support at his talk page and mine
I decided to see who was user Durin and read his works
From about 30 or more articles authored by user Durin I tagged four of them because missing references and citations
Durin and supporters some of who may be alter egosclaimed harassment
I spoke about the problem on the phone with the Dean and she advised me to let go and to contact epolorg an agency that has helped them previously on matters regarding copyrights violations in the Net
I followed advise handled the editions of those articles to other editors for avoiding conflict of interests and wrote a polite message informing user Durin that I had abandoned my query with him even if he did not provide at any time who or where my work was used I added recognition and 
apologized for rudeness and also that then I left the matters in the hands of the recommended agency and that unless he wanted to help he didnt need further involvement given that the agency would sort out who is using my work
User Durin misunderstood my message and panicked by reasons only known to him and retired from Wikipedia informing so at his page Also please be aware that reading user Durins pages he has been threatening with retiring for a good while seemingly using this situation in good timing
Coincidentally an administrators attention was called by the issue and blocked me for legal threats please keep in  mind that these existed only in the interpretation of others of my words and not in precise wording and less in my intentions
I requested unblocking and I was requested to prove that no Wikipedian or Wikiorganization was involved in any legal action
I asked the agency I reported the case to to please inform Wikipedia about their no involvement they did so clearly saying that the case is against sites using my work and neither Wikipedia nor any editor is involved in the case
Far from the block be removed the administrators not only left the block in place in spite of no legal threats existed but also questioned the existence of the agency handling my case
In the most interrogation or better said organized crime fashion I received administrators messages that I must tell who they are or I will remain blocked It seems no longer the block obeys to policies about legal threats
User Durin while retired and showing so at his page left messages in the blocking discussion page my talk page warning administrators to not lift the block curious retirement
The block is now justified by the administrators involved saying that they are investigating if the epolo
