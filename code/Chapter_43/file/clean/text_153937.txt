Request assistance deleting old talk page 

Greetings two of the Wikipedia Sysops or whatevery you call them here refuse to let me delete the content of my talk page for reasons that go beyond my understanding Some of the material in the talk page is personal The page includes rough drafts with mistakes that I never intended to make permanent Had I known I would not be allowed to delete this material I would never have posted it in the first place

You recently archived part of the page which is fine of course I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page as I do from time to time You raised no objection and it never occured to me that anyone would object but apparently these other two sysops do object I would appreciate it if you could take steps to clear the page If you want to keep a copy of any material there for your own purposes please feel free to do so

For more information see the message I am about to post here

Please unblock and delete page

I anticipate Mr Connolley will block my access again after I post that message so I am sending you this first
