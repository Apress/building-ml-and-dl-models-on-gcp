Casualties 

Does anybody have a source for the current casualty figures The Battle Book gives very different figures
 Prussia 1935 killed and 7237 wounded
 Austria 13000 killed 18393 wounded 13000 prisoners and 174 guns captured
These are so different from the current values I didnt want to change them without asking first Â TCE
