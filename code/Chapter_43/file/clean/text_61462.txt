Russian transliteration
Dear Nixer  I am sorry but I had to revert your changes back  Unfortunately they look and are so illiterate and uninformed that I am at a loss as to where even to start to explain the mistakes you introduced with your edits  Do you even know Russian  Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh but your edits were so bad that I first mistook them for a form of vandalism hence I did not care to explain my revert  I will gladly show you stepbystep what exactly is wrong with your edits and why that is if you are interested of course  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions  You are also welcome to participate in Wikipedia talkNaming conventions Cyrillicthis discussion started only recently with the purpose of having Cyrillics transliteration conventions used in Wikipedia reworked  Meanwhile please note that the translit system outlined in the article you edited is a slightly modified BGNPCGN version which is currently whats used in Wikipedia for transliterating Russian
