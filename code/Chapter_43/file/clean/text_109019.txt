3RR violation by Im still here 

Here is how the 3 Revert Rule works 
 I posted something
 CJCurrie reverted it 1
 I reverted it 1
 CJCurrie reverted it 2
 I reverted it 2
 CJCurrie reverted it 3  3 times Learn how to count

Furthermore the information reverted was valid information with a documentation link that seemed to displease CJCurrie

Notice the history of changes I did not end up reverting a 3rd time but CJCurrie did I just posted links that are related and verifiable And by the way CJCurrie some of the names in the list of Warmans cases are just in the complaint phase as well so if you say anyone can file a complaint please feel free to remove the names from the list as well
