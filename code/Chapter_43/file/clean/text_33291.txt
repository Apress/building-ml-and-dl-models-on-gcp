Condoning Bullying 

I have not really been around for weeks indeed months but I have been suffering regular harassment from Jbhunley and you and others seem to be condoning his behaviour It is never acceptable for someone to give another person unwanted attention for months on end

 Many of the articles he nominates for deletion should be tagged not deleted Wikipedia needs improvement not amputation
 The number of my articles he has nominated is well up in double figures
 He does not seem to read or research the articles he nominates properly
 He does not have much or any knowledge about some of the thousands of articles he nominates
 He seems to have no understanding that people have lives off Wikipedia I cannot spend SIX HOURS dealing with one of his mistakes

You seem to have little understanding of what personal abuse is Coming back after weeks or even months and finding someone is still trawling through my user history and leaving messages on my page  that is personal abuse If he is acting within the rules it is about time the rules were changed Wikipedia was not set up to be a toxic environment full of cliques it is supposed to be the encyclopedia anyone can edit
