hello 

concerning your additions on Immortal Techniques discography
good job the singles were missing but i am not sure if the
3 internet bootlegsmixtapes shoudl appear there as well
but maybe since he gained a fair share of his fanbase through
the internet it should stay there  but maybe it should say
internetpeer to peer only or something

keep it up
