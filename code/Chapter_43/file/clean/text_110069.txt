Periodically someone tries to add this persons name to the United States Coast Guard article and it is reverted as vandalism  I have researched this person on the internet and it appears that the claim is made that she was a Coast Guardsman at one time or another but no details as to time period or duty stations is given The web page I viewed was rather selfserving and I am not sure what purpose it served  As far as I am concerned the person in question is non notable and I will remove further attempts to place the name in the list of notable Coast Guardsmen until a Wikipedia article is created by that title and reasons are given for its inclusion in Wikipedia as a notable person
