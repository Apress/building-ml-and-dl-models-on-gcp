Oh I see now I did not read the deletion request properly Dont worry there is no agenda to be pushed here I simply read the Greek diaspora page and seeing that there is no section for Greeks in Eygpt I thought I would help  BTW I know there are at least half a million Greeks there still and some of the most famous Greeks in modern history are from there I have put the article into the Greek wiki listings for expansion already
