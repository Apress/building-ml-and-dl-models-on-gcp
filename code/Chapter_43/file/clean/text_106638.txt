Since I know that other people will read this Ill explain for their benefit you should areadly know the following Dougweller Mzilikazis first Aesop edit war laster 15 years and he was allied with you Johnbod and Haploidavey Those seeking to protect the article from his hijacking were me Nikopolis 99160252242 6845189203 1929125352 6810722028 and several other editors Mzilikazi and his sock puppet Afkun obviously unhappy with losing the edit war 8 months earlier started a new one in February 2013 A few days ago I undid the hijacked version of the article and Mzilikazi was obviously worried because I was instrumental in stopping the four of you in the first edit war Therefore Mzilikazi reassembled the team by canvassing Johnbod and Haploidavey You didnt need to be canvassed because you had already joined in If he had indeed been merely telling all of the interested parties he would have to fetch Nikopolis and the others as well Instead he only gathered his supporters since his intention was canvassing just as he did here in the first edit war
