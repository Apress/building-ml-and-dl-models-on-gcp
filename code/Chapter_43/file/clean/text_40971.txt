Article name 

 recently moved this article from Muhammad bin Nayef to Muhammad Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia This is in accordance with WikipediaNaming conventions royalty and nobility but there is ambiguity with Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud a crown prince who resigned

The other Saudi crown princes who never became king are named without title This is in contrast to for example Arthur Prince of Wales Whatever is decided here should be applied to princes Sultan and Nayef who both died as crown prince

My opinion is that Muhammad bin Nayef is the most appropriate name but Id like to see a consensus before the article moves again aco
