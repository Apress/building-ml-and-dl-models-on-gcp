Scott 

Hi  Its me again Jim  When I came back to see if youd answered I looked around a bit and saw that youve had some involvement in editing the Scientology page  Scott would you please take a look at the Rawat page and tell me if you cant see a big fat qualitative difference As a recent apparent Wikipasserby Bishonen noted the article reads like a hagiography  It sure is nowhere near as straightforward as the one on Scientology  So wouldnt it be ironic and somewhat fitting if you of all people took a hand in making that article fair and balanced  Completing a circle in a sense if you know what I mean

Thanks 
Jim
