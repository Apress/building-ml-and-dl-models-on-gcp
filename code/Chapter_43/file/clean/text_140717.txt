Du hast 

As mentioned in the actual article linked to what you were correcting the English version was released with lyrics purposely confusing haßt and hast choosing hate Cut and pasted from that article

As stated earlier the English version of Du Hast is not translated but changed altogether Du hasst du haßt means you hate The extra s differentiates it from the conjugated verb form of haben to have

As you seem to be ignoring that article firm in the belief that the band really meant something other than the English lyrics which they used perhaps you could provide a citation for that knowledge as opposed to spending time lecturing on haben and hassen leaving me simply on the edge of my seat for the sequel concerning sein and essen Meh
