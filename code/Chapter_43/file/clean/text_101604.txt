Confusing 

I tagged this article as confusing due to the Structure part It reads Red Hat Enterprise Linux is largely composed of software packages distributed under free software andor open source licenses but is made available in a usable binary form such as on CDROM or DVDROM media or download only to paying subscribers However it does not explain what is the meaning of paying subscribers ie what do the subscribers pay for For getting RHEL in a CDROM Definitely they dont pay 100 dollars for getting it in a CD or DVD they pay it for the support However the article skips that Red Hat offers support as abruptly says CentOS is freely available for download and use by the public but is not maintained or supported by Red Hat instead of using something like this RHEL though licensed at GPL must be bought from Red Hat since they provide full maintenance and support for it However CentOS is not supported by Red Hat and is thus freely available for download and use by the public I will try to cleanup the article once I get the time for it   Talk
