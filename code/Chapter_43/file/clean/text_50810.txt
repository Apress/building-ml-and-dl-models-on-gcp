Reply to my fellow Mongols Deliogul  Laertes_d 
Laertes you know as much of History as a Turk Yes Horton was propaganda 
Anatolia Asia Minor was BYZANTINEGREEK for CENTURIES before you Turkish invaders came from the Altai mountains and Mongolia so in 1919 we just tried to liberate what was and still is ours
You can only claim Ulan Bator as your homeland not Asia Minor which belongs to Greeks Armenians
Kurds and Arabs
PSdont usurp a good Greek name like Laertes try something of your culture eg Kucuk Skebe
Ye

Delioglu whether you and all other Kemalist fascists like it the Genocide of Pontic Greeks and Armenians IS a fact recognised by every respectable historian including a few of yours
Try to open your eyes because sometimes History repeats itself but with victs and victims reversed and you might not like what you will see in a few years in what you will now call your country
