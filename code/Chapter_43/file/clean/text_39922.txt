Thanks for the prompt reply  The block by Tan was unwarranted  First he was not a party to the discussions  Second the block and refernce to harrassement and vandalism are also embarrasing  my sign on is my real name  Lastly I am new to all this  If the moderator Kuru had initially stated he was a moderator when he deleted my entry this would probably be different  He didnt and I took him as just another person  My approach like my personality was intense but not abusive or harrassement Thank you Dale Menendez
