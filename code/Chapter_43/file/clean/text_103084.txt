Yes those IPs were mine At the time I didnt feel comfortable owning up to having the previous IP This was because I forgot that I already submitted a similar question and felt foolish upon realizing that I just submitted it twice

I also felt surprised that someone was able to connect my past IPs to my present one It wasnt the kind of surprise I would hope for This is why I felt hesitant to own up to being the reincarnation of these past IPs

I promised that I would admit it if those IPs were not false positives and delivered on said promise

I am not sure what color to change the background to but will try harder to decide and change it anyhow if you archive your older talkpage topics because 188 is far too many to scroll through 7017917463
