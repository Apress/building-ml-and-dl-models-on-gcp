If someone enters Twins there is a good chance that heshe is looking for something other than Minnesota Twins Possibly something in film TV or music Actually as the hatnote is currently laid out that reader must go to the very end of the hatnote so it makes just as much sense to move the Twins DAB link so it appears before the sports link Or for that matter Im fine with moving placing For other uses see Twins disambiguation or Twin disambiguation first in the hatnote followed by the baseball team But in any case I see no evidence whatsoever that most readers who enter Twins are looking for the baseball team We had that argument in the previous debate with no convincing evidence that applies to Wikipedia not Google readers
