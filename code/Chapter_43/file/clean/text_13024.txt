Cilla Black 

Its interesting that you removed an unsourced comment from the Cilla Black page Originally there was a source for this note taken from the BBC News However YOU deleted that source You replaced it with a quote from some fan Internet site BBC vs Fan Internet Mmmmmmm I know which one I think is more reliable Its a bit rich to be deleting reliable sources and replacing them with unreliable ones Ill probably be banned now for daring to cross you Cest la vie
