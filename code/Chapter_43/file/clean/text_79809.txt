Featured article 

I read the article and it is pretty good but it is not very aesthetically pleasing One of the four criteria of a featured article is that it have images I think three images in an article of this size is too little Something needs to be inserted to break up the huge text blocks Since I have never seen the movie I dont think Im the best person to take on this task Cheers
