There are more than 150 hits for TLIP on google according to discussion  And if Bay Currents had an article mentioning the film maker  I would say it is notable  Can you please state the name of the article and date  Post it to the AFD discussion and also cite it in the TLIP article  If you dont want to then just post it to my discussion page here and I will get the reference up on the AFD page and TLIP article and change my vote to keep Waikiki ElectricEye
