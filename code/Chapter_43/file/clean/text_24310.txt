Table comparing UNGA resolutions on the ArabIsraeli conflict with other conflicts 

This table is a clearcut violation of WPOR and WPSYNTH It is against Wikipedia rules for editors to conduct their own research using primary sourcs The footnotes clearly state that the statistics have been compiled by a Wikipedia editor this is unacceptable

 If the table was produced by a secondary source then it might be acceptable
