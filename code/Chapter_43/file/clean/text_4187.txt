Empowered by amnesty and reward
There is a brand new arbcom opened up against Coffee a precursor of the disruption and drama and utter contempt that editors will now have moving forward Mr MacDonald cannot have it both ways he cannot show utter contempt for community consensus intentionally creating drama and disruption then two days later attempt to create community consensus 

As I wrote in the arbcom
Arbcom sent a powerful empowering message to editors like Coffee by giving them amnesty our community rules dont matter and administrators will be forgiven and rewarded for blatantly breaking our community rules

As I learned in the KWW RFA if editors say a blatant falsehood enough times it becomes truth Already people are stating that no rules were broken in the RFC BLP when no one could argue that rules were broken and I argue they  were broken with utter contempt

Excuse me but I have an administrator to desysop You will be happy to note that my focus on Scott will be minimal in the next few days as I focus on Coffees rich edit history

I look forward to your comment supporting Coffee in the arbcom  Frank Andersson 45 revisions restoredan olympic medallist for fks sake
