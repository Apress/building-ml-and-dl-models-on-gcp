I dont understand your last edit comment where you said I reintroduced firstperson terms  I didnt Whether water counts as the same word or not is an open question  if one individuated words according to their meaning a perfectly plausible way to do it then it would seem not if words were individuated some other way then possibly In any event I note the current version does not say they are the same word so it matters not The only difference then in your version is the introduction of the names Frederick and Froderick and I am not going to revert over something like that When you ask me to take the nonsense somewhere else I should remind you that the Twin earth section was wrong yesterday and correct today precisely on account of my involvement I would have thought that some thanks were due rather than an unpleasant request such as this In any event I did take the nonsense somewhere else  I took it out the section on Twin Earth and threw it away That is why my correct version is what currently appears in the article
