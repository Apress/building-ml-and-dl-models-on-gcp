The image isnt doctored Im almost positive its a screen shot from Death and the Maiden and I would say fair use because its just being supplied to illustrate what she looks like in an academic project takes an incredibly small part of the film and does not in any way supplant sales of the film  I dont necessarily have a problem with it myself and I dont think we should go out of our way to find or avoid images that may have nudity in them if they are appropriate to the article  Perhaps just to avoid the connotation and allegations of a celeb nude web site however something of Ms Weaver not in a wet tshirt might be better  Or maybe just crop to the head and shoulders   0042 23 Aug 2004 UTC
