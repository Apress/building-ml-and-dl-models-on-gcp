Unholy Aliance  
I see that a group of wiki users greeks I presume are undoing my edits repeatedly I fear these greeks have clearly a megali idea ultranationalist agenda which they are pursueing thoroughly and roughlessly My experience is limited since I am new to wikipedia hence I would like to invite the admins to take the necessary countermeasures 
Back to the article the Greek or Vlach toponym are totally superfluos since neither of these languages is official in Albania nor there is any indigeneous greek or vlach speaking community in the city So far not a single source has been brought to  attest the countrary Let alone the sentence of being centre of greekness is at least ridicuous As une user has written precedntly The city itself is almost entirely Albanian populated with the Greek minority living in the adjacent villagesnamely Dropul Droviani etc The city itself gave birth to a number of Albanian nationalists artists and politiciansmost notorious being Enver Hoxha The city itself was built under the Ottoman period and shows architecture typical of the Ottoman Empire and formed part of what was unofficially recognized as Arnavutluk Before then it was nothing more than a fortress that from the 14th century onwards passed from one Albanian tribal lord to another As it is seen here  in the diary of John Cam Hobhouse of his travels with Lord Byron in 1810s Gjirokastra is refered as a  city inhabited by Turks ei moslems But seems to me that no one here is interested on the truth but only on their fascist ultranationalist agendas  It is also my opinion that UserTsourkpk has not displayed proper decorum and objectivity on many ethnically charged articles involved greece I would like  his history on Wikipedia and this article to be taken in consideration
