OK I dont want to fight no more Just how come you say you didnt attack me and who accused me of edit war without a strong reason I obviously didnt want to fight with you but with the IP addresses which I believed belonged to one of you most possibly to Drmies I was enhancing your work later on and you accused me of constant reverting Why The only thing I reverted was the damage made by someone hiding under various IP addresses OK Im willing to end this conflict Arguing leads nowhere and only peaceful cooperation leans somewhere As I see your recent edits in the article are quite alright and whats important theyre sourced Now check my point and answer in that talk section  Thanks
