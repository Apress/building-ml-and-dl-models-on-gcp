Characters 

I notice previous edits have removed several characters Is there a reason for this Perhaps it was because some of the characters described are relatively minor The revision that was current earlier today had a description matching Soraya as the second half of Jacks description I just figured we could talk about which characters should be there although I undid a previous edit Another previous edit had also removed descriptions for characters such as Matt and Lily Im just wondering why There were other options available like splitting characters into primary and secondary characters
