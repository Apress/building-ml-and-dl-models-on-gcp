This is one of the best articles Ive ever read on Wikipedia 

It contains lots of sources about a k hole and reading it reminds me of previous experiences  With other drug trips its usually always different  With Ketamine its usually always the same  A k hole is the only way to describe it  And since you have a major article on ketamine describing its main effect then warrants its own article  

I vote to keep this article  Dont delete an article about talking with god
