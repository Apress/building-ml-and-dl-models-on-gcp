To the guy claiming S Korea has more patents than the US I did some research into WIPOs latest database 2007 to stop both of you from making nonsense claims and reveal the truth So here we go straight from the horses mouth

South Korea had the worlds largest filings per GDP ahead of all countries
South Korea had the worlds largest filings per RD ahead of all countries
South Korea had the worlds 2nd largest filings per million population ahead of USA and Germany UK and France
South Korea had the worlds 3rd largest resident filings  ahead of EU and Germany UK France and Canada
South Korea had  the worlds 4th largest total patent filings ahead of EU Germany Canada UK and France

So I guess Lakshmix claim isnt completely wrong but Aerain is right in that the US has more total patents than S Korea I think the sentence simply needs rephrasing as you can see above
