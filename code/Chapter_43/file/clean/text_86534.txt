1 WPSPAMSource soliciting also mentions what you enumerate are just some guidelines

2 You cannot consider Spam offering a 100 matching reference in just 4 wikipedia pages Spam handles much bigger figures

3The discussion here about Serva was vandalized by  when erasing independent Serva references Fortunately there was an editor reverting  disruptive editing on this page

4 You guys are making the source controversial

5 Serva has a nonexpiring license version nonsupporter 100 Free the 2 first download links on the quoted download page are for the Free version

 you have been corrected here by an editor restoring your deletions I encourage you to stop vandalizing this page

And now Id like to rise again my unanswered questioning about the systematic inclusion of ERPXE COBBLER and EL TORITO in this page Why are those projects included in this page
