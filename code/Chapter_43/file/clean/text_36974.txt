wikipedia isnt perfect but its model is sound 

Can I suggest that you two guys read Professor John Naughtons excellent article in THE OBSERVER of 100814 If it helps you understand it I can get it translated into Belgian French or Walloon and into Dutch I use both Wikipedia and ODNB and both are equally intransigent unwilling or refusing to change ones views or to agree about something
synonyms uncompromising inflexible unbending unyielding diehard unshakable unwavering resolute rigid unaccommodating uncooperative stubborn obstinate obdurate pigheaded singleminded ironwilled stiffnecked intransigeant onverzettelijk in frenchdutch

I CAN DEBATE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF WIKIPEDIA UNTIL AS WE SAY IN COLLOQUIAL ENGLISH THE COWS COME HOME BUT THERE IS NO COMPLETE AGREEMENT ANYWHERE IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD AS TO WHO EXACTLY CONSTITUTED THE BLOOMSBURY GROUP SO ALL THE MEMBERS ARE A MATTER OF OPINION AND NOT FACT GUYS

WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF MALE MEMBERS WERE CAMBRIDGE APOSTLES

Understand the above points and we may have the basis for further discussion Otherwise22713174
