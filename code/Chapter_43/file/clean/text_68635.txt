Since I actually created the Earp Vendetta Ride page 
In Jan 2006 which Lastexit edited within 3 mo I was amused an awed by your clever synthesis but theres something you missed Earp was a gentile who married a Jew Mantanmoreland claims to be a gentile with some Jewish blood and an admitted fascination with antisemetism and of course India I suggested on the TALK page that the easiest explanation of the Mantanmoreland fascination with Weiss followed by their joint trip to India to the same odd village where Weiss went to marry is that Mantanmoreland is simply the person Weiss went to India to marry That persons an economics geek from the East coast who now lives with Weiss and has always editted on his time schedule Duh My comments were not only deleted but my conclusions were labeled silly They may be wrong but I fail to see why they are silly No evidence has been presented for Mantanmoreland being Weiss which isnt explained just as well even better by his biggest fan Mantanmoreland being more than a fan but less than a sock Anyway thanks for the essay Dunno why your ideas are allowed to survive on the evidence page names and all but mine are not even allowed on the TALK page Sheesh
