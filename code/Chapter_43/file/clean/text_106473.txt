The reference to Shirley Temples Pussy is true Not sure about Stinky Toilet Paper but is was most likely just a name tossed around when they changed their name Like many early 90s grunge bands STP was playing clubs and bars Because of the genre it was not uncommon for a band to have a less than polite name That was fine when you were local but not so much if you wanted a major label or radio to brand you Nobody knows about Shirley Temples Pussy because they changed their name before releasing Core How do I know this Did I go to an early STP concert No BUT Eddie Vedder mentioned them at a concert held at The Off Ramp in Seattle when Pearl Jam played a secret concert there on October 1993 It was just one of those names you dont forget
