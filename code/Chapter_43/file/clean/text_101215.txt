Theres the expression better to deal with the devil you know rather than the devil you dont We understood the original opposition However the trouble got worse when those outsiders came in and the proposed mediation placed the talkpage under extreme police oversight Prior to that I think there had been progress in fixing the article since February and some of the other editors have been willing to compromise with new details inserted However I understand the improvements came at great sacrifice of your time In the mediation phase new people contacted their admin friends and hence we saw the recent abuses of admin power deleting new images because they might be rejected at FileforDeletion blocking a user for posting a joke etc Meanwhile if you put similar text in numerous other articles it does not all get censored I have been putting fairuse images in other articles for years I wont mention titles for fear of targeting So if you updated examples in articles about footprint anatomy then details would remain for months unhacked The only caveat is dont mention those article names here and update so many that people would get tired of following your edits Wikid77
