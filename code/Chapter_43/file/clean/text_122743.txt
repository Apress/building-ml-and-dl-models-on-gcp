 Kaikolas cannot be classifed by the Aryan Varna caste system 

Kaikolars cannot be classified by the  Aryan Varna caste system This is similar to putting a Arab or Jew or African or Chinese into Kshatriya Vysya etc The  Aryan Varna caste system is only for Aryans Kaikolans are tamilians

Which language group belong to ARYA VARNA CASTE SYSTEM

Pakistanis

 Pallava are Brahmin 

Pallavas are brahmins They have made many inscriptions claiming that they are are brahmins of Bharadvaja gotra Hence Pallavas are not considered as tamil kings

Then what happened to the decendants of the Pallava kings in Tamil Nadu

Pallavas never claimed as brahmans at the start of their power Later only some Pallavas left some inscriptions as they belonged to Bharadwaja Gothra

The early Pallavas belonged to Nanthi gothra Pallavas used NANTHI BULL their emblem Kaikolans are still belong to NANTHI GOTHRA

I hope the pius DEVADASI system became a system of only dancing and prostitution after the demise of the PALLAVA empire
