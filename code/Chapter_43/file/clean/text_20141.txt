The offending picture and references to racism have been removed Altering this article was not meant as a partisan act or meant to be the opening salvo of flame war Please please consider point 2 above before another kneejerk RV vandalism 

I must however defend the use of material from another article The history of the SNP article is well written and uncontested and using this material is a good way of avoiding bias

Whether an organisation has two people or two thousand it does not justify irrelevantly labelling them racist without the first shred of evidence I agree entirely with this statement However

1 If an organisation has only two people it does not belong in an encyclopedia

2 If said organisation maintains a website featuring an extensive article on the issue of race then they become slightly more difficult to defend
