Response to HJ Mitchells challenge 

Since I am still blocked and cannot post this in response to HJs challenge nor can I vote for the three candidates I do support I will leave this here
Hj Mitchell please spare us the dramatics of Ill quite if you give me a reason No one here thinks you will quite regardless of any reasons given nor would you be expected too You are also fully aware that no one is going to mine through your edits looking for wrongdoing Thats just a waste of time and you would likely retort with they are NOTHERE What I will do is give you a few examples of what I have seen over a very short span of time Given a review of any say month long period I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean
You made an obviously bad call about Protonk a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see that no one supported your decision This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence After reviewing the comment Protonk made I certainly agree it was a bad comment but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives
As mentioned above and as noted by several individuals your Fucking morons comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues
Even based on your comments here you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement Personally I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edits from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions
I could keep going but that is enough IMO to show a pattern of conduct not appropriate of a functionary 96255237170
