A warning for what exactly And wow where have I seen this crowd beforememo to everyone I really dont care about anything I dont edit for Wikipedia anymore I edit for the subjects of articles nearexclusively If this makes me disconnected from Wikipedia policies and standards then I guess its only a matter of time until it catches me out big time and I lose adminship But until then Ill be continuing along the same path I have for the last few months If I get blocked over something like this itll simply be a weekend in the middle of the week which is something Ive been screaming at my university and place of employment to implement anyways Wikipedia is progressive I guess so its always a possibility
