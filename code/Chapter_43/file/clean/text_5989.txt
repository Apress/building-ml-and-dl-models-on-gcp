Note that in one case the conversion was incorrect before the vandalism and had been so for a while  Since 25404 fts actually equals 7743 m Id guess that the 7643 was either miscopied when originally put there else subject to earlier vandalism  But these numbers should also set off some red flags for their precision so a reliable source for that number would be especially useful
