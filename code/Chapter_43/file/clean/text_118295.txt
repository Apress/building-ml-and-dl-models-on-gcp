Whohow to report vandalism 

Hi  I am very impressed with your ClueBot  I logged in to wikipediaVAN to watch it in action its cool  I often revert vandalism myself on the pages on my watchlist and sometimes I check the vandals contributions page to see if heshe has been messing with other pages I often find multiple incidences of vandalism by these users and while I can revert their changes I have no idea to whom I can report their actions or how to go about it  Can you provide any pointers  Thanks
