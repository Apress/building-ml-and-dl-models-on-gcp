Is OhInternet a recreation of Encyclopedia Dramatica 

To tangent from the above topics

Oh Internet is not Encyopedia Dramatica as the article supposes Encyclopedia Dramatica is defined as the domain name wwwencyclopediadramaticacom and the intellectual property concerned with ED copyright OhInternet however is a different project entirely notable differences a new XML coding system logo and form of satire To use terms in the article the site was not overhauled but rather replaced 

To use Silverserens analogy if Wikipedia did rename itself kept most of its higher administration and stopped using Wikimedia software would it still be Wikipedia The answer is No The Wikipedia name and intellectual property becomes inactive lost If one were to charge a Wikipedia fork site with copyright violations they would have to give evidence of their ownership of Wikipedia copyright and not that of the new OhKnowledgecom the hypothetical Wikipedia replacement Sherrod however does have evidence so dont take this as a justification for the ch Once a site loses connection with the old name or any registered associated material it ceases to be the same entity Oh Internet has no parallels to the old site at all The position that the new site is ED just cleaned should be removed from the article immediately

Encyclopedia Dramatica as defined is dead OhInternet is a whole new project  a de facto successor but not ED The redirect was an attempt to maintain website hits but as many 3rd party websites will show it didnt quite work out The vast majority of the volunteer editors did leave Site activity growth and edit numbers are much higher at encyopediadramaticiach than at OhInternet OhInternets declining popularity should first stabilize before any notability assessment goes underway 

Understandably the nature of EDch is illegal so I dont care for it immediate coverage I like to think the site will cool down over time
