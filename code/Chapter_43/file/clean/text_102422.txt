No your contributions were confusing as though you were gaming the system Remember when you alerted the nowdeparted Ian Tresman to my edits at scientific community I asked you about it then and you were as far as I can tell being duplicitous Im disgusted with your behavior at Wikipeida as a singlepurpose account frankly and I do not care about it You are welcome to continue to make suggestions here at the talk page but Im very upset that you did not divulge your personal connection with Eric Lerner at the outset You wereare being duplicitous all along and you know it
