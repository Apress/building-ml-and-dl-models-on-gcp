UserHkelkar vandalising Pak articles
This user keeps inserting poverty data in economy article and owns the page reverting others edits He also insists on old data showing 32 below poverty line in 2000 instead of the latest data showing 25 below poverty line in 2004Please look into it

Per precedent in Economy of India mentioning poverty is entirely acceptable 

Your edits are duplicated from poverty article with old data
Then update it with new data but dont blank the section 

Also look at Economy of the United StatesPoverty If a big developed country like USA can have a section on poverty it is only fair that other countries have the same

 ImageDr Shamshadjpeg 
Thanks for uploading ImageDr Shamshadjpeg I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created If you believe this image is not replaceable please

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add Replaceable fair use disputed
 On the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all

Alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject or by taking a picture of it yourself

If you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on  this link Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you   talk random
