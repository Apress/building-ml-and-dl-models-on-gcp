Thanks for your consideration  You are reasonable to work with so I appreciate the listening  Not sure if I will continue as you suggest  its all getting pretty tiresome since no one seems to be interested in adding or cleaning up content  I have a lot of Wikiarticles im interested in that I keep a look at many of them weak   overall edits adding content are very rare  This Gyp article with all the effort on the talk page about references many of them available online and no one willing to transfer that understanding to the article
