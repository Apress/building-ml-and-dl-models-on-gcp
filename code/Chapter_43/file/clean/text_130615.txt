Release date 

An anon IP has edited the page to alter the release date

Despite common misconception the game was NOT released in all territories simultaneously and it came out in November not August I have no idea why everybody thinks it was August Im looking at a copy of Dec 97 N64 Mag right now  it was Nov

GameSpots review is dated August 1997 and when Edge recently put their original review online they said it was originally printed in the July 1997 issue Edge is a UK publication but its reviews usually reflect a games earliest worldwide release  or at least its earliest English language release

To the anon editor a magazine with a different release date might prove your assertion that the game was not a simultaneous worldwide release So what country is your copy of that magazine from

Does anyone else have copies of magazines from the games launch that could be cited as references for its release date Talk
