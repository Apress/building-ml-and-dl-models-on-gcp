Please Unprotect Zaky Mallah 

Not sure why this was ever protected  A few bad edits is not a good reason  Protecting is for edit wars gross slander etc  And deserves an explanation on the what was empty talk page  Hiding edits is an even higher bar

There have been major issues around Mallah which are producing a large queue on the talk page  If you insist on protecting this page then you need to do the work and keep it updated
