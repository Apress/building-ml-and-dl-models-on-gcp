please observe these Wiki guidelines on the Pro se page

In the Wiki model an article which may currently be poorly written poorly formatted lack sufficient sources or not be a comprehensive overview of the subject can be improved and rewritten to fix its current flaws That such an article is lacking in certain areas is a relatively minor problem and such articles can still be of benefit to Wikipedia In other words the remedy for such an article is cleanup not deletion

But the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide information the potential readership or subjective usefulness of each item does not have to be justified if the material is notable

 while some editors may dislike certain kinds of information that alone isnt enough by itself for something to be deleted This may be coupled with or replaced by the unexplained claim that they feel that the information is unencyclopedic see Just unencyclopedic above Such claims require an explanation of whichpolicy the content fails and and explanation of why that policy applies as the rationale for deletion See also Pointing at policy

Wikipedia editors are a pretty diverse group of individuals and potentially any subject or topic may be liked or disliked by some editor somewhere However personal preference is not a valid reason to keep or delete an article It is insufficient to simply assert that an article or the subject of an article is not appropriate for Wikipedia The debate is not a vote please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken sustained by arguments and the same applies to all deletion debates Any statement that just consists of Keep or Delete with a signature can easily be dismissed by the admin making the final decision and changing Keep to Strong keep will not make it any more relevant Try to present persuasive reasons in line with policy or consensus as to why the articletemplatecategorywhatever should be keptdeleted and try to make sure it is an argument based on the right reasons httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions
