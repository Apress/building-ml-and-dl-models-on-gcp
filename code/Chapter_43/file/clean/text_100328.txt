Please consider joining me in filing an RFC over the Zionism links issue 

Id like to keep this as narrow as possible and focus only on the links section If youre interested could I ask you to provide me with

a a few diffs illustrating reversions on the article page that reflect bias on the part of career editors there

b if you feel like it specific instances of incivility or bias you encounted on the talk page there  

Thanks
