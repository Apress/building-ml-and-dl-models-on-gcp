The Macrae book has a number of problems lousy writing being the most irksome but least defective among them  Heims  strangely not yet mentioned in the further reading for this article is better in most respects but incomplete as a biography  A thorough and truly complete biography of von Neumann has never been written and it is a shame  While the sentiments of friends and family members are sometimes useful in evaluating a book they cant be counted on to be the last word  This is of course the principle strike against the Goldstine book as well  But Goldstine isnt intended to be a von Neumann biography so it doesnt even really belong in this discussion  0955 30 August
