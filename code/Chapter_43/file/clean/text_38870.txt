Amjikian the only thing The Myotis is trying to say is that if you believe the article is biased then the best way to help is to point out which parts of it are biased and how to improve them Pending this your 5000 words in this subtitle are respectfully completely useless and irrelevant I would also point out that since there is constant debate surrounding this topic any obvious portrayal of a polarized POV will automatically identify you with one side or the other and wont help at all I sincerely suggest you change your approach if you want to improve this article or you will only be providing ammunition to the opposing POV side
