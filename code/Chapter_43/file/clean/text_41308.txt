Mick Cooke 

Hi

I know the more you delete others work the more likely you will climb the latter to adminship here but maybe you should have used some common sense when deleting Mick Cooke He is the manager of Monaghan United FC and there are several sources to verify the claim As I argued on Finbar Prunty if you delete him there will be thousands of small league managers and players to delete At least be consistent Here are the sources that verify his existence
