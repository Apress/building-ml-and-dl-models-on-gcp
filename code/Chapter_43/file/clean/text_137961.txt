Your advice sounds like a threat and that is not appreciated In any case what does WPEW have to do with this 1RR discussion If I am right then I am entitled to 1 revert and there is no edit war If I am not then there still is no edit war because I at last thought I am right So again what does WPEW have to do with anything As you can see from my edit on that page before and after what you claim was a second revert my only goal is to improve that article and reach a version which is both good and everybody can live with
