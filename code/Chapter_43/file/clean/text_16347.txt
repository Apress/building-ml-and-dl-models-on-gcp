Youre 100 correct On the other hand I am human so when that editor left such an aggressive comment containing quite an offensive assumption I simply got upset for such a negative attitude What you are saying is true I do edit other articles as an anonymous IP but the answer I gave him was precise  I do not have other active accounts at the present moment Basically I have been blocked indefinitely for no just reason is there a way to get this over with and do the proper adjustments in my block log Thank you very much in advance
