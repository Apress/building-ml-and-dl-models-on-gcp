Hello Ya im a student at NSU When I started Wikipedia NSU was the first article that I began to imporve and have had no help with it so anything you would like to do would be great If you think the photos need to increase then go for it but I would not make them two big so that it doesnt slow down computers with a slower internet connection or look bad on small screens I redid the info box and modeled it after the OU page I to have wanted to add info about BA and Muskogee for a while but I havent found much or got around to it If you wanna add to these parts of the article ill help you out if you need it I also will try to add some things myself to make it better
