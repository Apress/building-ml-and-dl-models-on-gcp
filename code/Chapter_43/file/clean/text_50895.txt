On TalkKingdom of Heaven movie  wrote that the real Humphrey IV was the local soft gay boy Sources state he avoided quarrel etc and rather obviously he later was Richard Lionhearts boyfriend While contemporary sources even the sympathetic Itinerarium Peregrinorum describe Humphrey as looking girlish and being effeminate in manner I dont recall any actually accusing him of being gay if they had it would have been very useful ammunition in the divorce proceedings As for being Richards lover  again where is this taken from I suspect it may be from James Restons sensationalist work not a primary source
