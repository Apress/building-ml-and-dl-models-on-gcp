As of this posting the Wikipedia roster for the Toronto Maple Leafs does not agree with its source that is the roster on the Maple Leafs website httpmapleleafsnhlcomteamappservicepagepageTeamPlayerstyperoster  At first glance the Wikipedia entry lists Mats Sundin on the roster and as the teams captain the source material lists no captain and Sundin is no where to be found I suggest that the Current Roster section be changed to reflect its source otherwise a different source should be used
