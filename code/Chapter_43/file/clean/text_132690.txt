Youre confusing neutrality with fallacy  The evidence against Hamas was woefully understated which I gladly improved Syntax is a nonissue here grammar is hardly an excuse for misinformation  I changed killing to execution because Hamas orchestrated a systematic execution of Fatah and its supporters  As in they lined them up on a wall and shot them in the face  They werent simply casualties of war they were executed as individuals  Get it  You being the creator of the article is irrelevant and in no way gives you ownership of articles  per WikipediaOwnership of articles  You say you are not the owner of the article but seem to be infatuated with the fact that you started it and that somehow gives you the right to tell me and everyone how it should be written  If syntax is your concern go ahead and edit the article according to your standards of English  But if that conflicts with my concern for facts and truth then I will most certainly edit it  I offered a very lengthy explanation for my edits in the talk section  Also I didnt mean to edit your user page template
