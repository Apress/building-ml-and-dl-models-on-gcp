Tawker With the first sentence your second edit to that is fine although I saw no reason to tinker with the sentence in the first place my mistake I just got mixed up between that and your first edit which wasnt so neutral sounding

With the second paragraph its relevancy is in question it is not notable and it is an nonconstructive edit  Howcome you didnt bring this up in the discussion page like you are supposed to You are on wikipedia long enough you should know this  

Also you added another unqualified edit to the 2008 referendums section  We talked about this didnt we You and I I dont understand why youd go ahead and insert independent elections administrator  We were talking about this for days but then you try to sneak it in the backdoor Be upfront and reasonable lets talk this shit out or the page is going to continue to be crappy marred by bad grammar spelling mistakes and nonneutral language
