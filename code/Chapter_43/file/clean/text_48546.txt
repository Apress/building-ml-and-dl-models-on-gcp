I think the reviewers all missed the note above explaining that this wont be a standalone Wikipedia page  instead its Vancouverspecific material will be added to the existing Daylighting streams page

The existing Daylighting streams page has an excessively long section about projects in Seattle  If you have time you might want to edit this section down so its about the same length as your Vancouver entry  You could also make any other improvements you like to this page  In future youll probably find that other editors have shortened both the Seattle and Vancouver sections
