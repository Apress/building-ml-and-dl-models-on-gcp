Bwilkins what a farce If I wanted to manipulate Cailils message what would I mean with What steps will this project take to uphold wikipedias values and its standards for conduct towards others see WikipediaHARASSOffwiki_harassment didnt prejudice a group of editors as a bunch of hooligans Its a nonsensible sentence 

Is it really that bizarre that I happened to write part of my message in the wrong place It shouldnt be too uncommon in Wikipedia to have a chunk of text on the wrong line Ill make it very clear this time 1 Im writing a message that will include prejudice as a bunch of hooligans Before reaching that I preview changes to see if the lining is in order that the message will be in the right place 2 Now returning to the editor I have two signed messages one that is mine  unpublished I accidentally write a part of my message before the wrong signature Cailils above 3 As I am not 100  concentrated on the Wikipedia tab and writing the message I probably think I must have erased that part already and write it with different wording anyway prejudice as  hint 4 I publish the comment without previewing changes

Im astonished you do not see it uses the same wording as my final comment Im astonished you think I would be so stupid to add a nonsensible sentence in someone elses message and then criticize it in the same edit with the same wording Either I have not been able to present my case well you are deliberately interpreting it in a malign way or you have not understood it properly 

didnt prejudice a group of editors as a bunch of hooligans Thats what I accidentally wrote on Cailils line But it even says didnt prejudice How is it making Cailil look bad again it doesnt make any sense Absurd Where is the personal attack
