US law before the recent changes in Dominican laws clearly stated that dual nationality was illegal It took a Supreme Court decision and the fact that Dominican law also prohibited dual nationality until the 1990s Mr Lithgows father was born in the DR simply because his mother was there when she had labor pains is father can be added to the list with the mention that he was born in the DR however John does not qualify for inclusion  Many Americans such as John Sununu born in Cuba John McCain born in Panama etc were born in Latin countries however they always had US citzenship and do not have any cultural blood political ties to the countries they were born John Lithgow does not refer to him as Dominican does not speak Spanish etc Just like Sununu and McCain their children do not get added to list of Cubans and Panamanians simply because their father was born there Many Haitians born in the DR are denied Dominican nationality They deserve to be recognized as Dominican more so than John Lithgow Once again Johns father can be added to the list with the mention that he was born in the DR however John does not qualify for inclusion His name will be removed Thank you for your understanding
