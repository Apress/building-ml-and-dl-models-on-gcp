Polish Marines
There were some references to 7th Coastal Defense Brigade as the Polish marines Unfortunately this is not true After disbanding the 7th Coastal Defense Division in 1989 and scrapping most of landing ships there is no amphibious assault unit in the Polish Army 
The  7th Coastal Defense Brigade only bears traditions of the 7th Division and it practices smallscale experimental exercises with amphibious assault but its still not amphibious assault unit At least up to 2007 there was no decision of creating a real amphibious assault unit in the Polish Army
