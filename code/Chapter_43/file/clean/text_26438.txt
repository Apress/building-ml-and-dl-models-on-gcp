Why not wait for all the details and tests to be done 

They are doing autopsies and toxicology and lord knows what else we are not told about  Why not wait until there is absolutes of what happened here  Right now it seems like guessing  Of course this is just my opinion but I think it all should stay out of the article until all is really known Of course changing the info box to him being dead should be done but then again when it is know when he died for sure Talk
