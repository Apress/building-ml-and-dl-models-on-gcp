Hello FlugKerl  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven  It is great article and wellsourced  I have just done a little copyediting  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence The number of VanGrunsvendesigned homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error  It states that the number of Vans aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds   and compares it with all commercial general aviation companies  Vans aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world not just in the USA and Canada so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldnt be confined to North America  Secondly if you are talking about all commercial general aviation companies you are including such companies worldwide  The number of aircraft produced by the worlds general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because outside North America Europe and other Englishspeaking countries aircraft manufacturers dont report their production statistices to anyone and are not obliged to do so  I suggest the sentence should say
The number of VanGrunsvendesigned homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America
