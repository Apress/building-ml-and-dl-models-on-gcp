Being mathematician I like different rules and strong logic I would like to know more about rules For example Ive tried to decide which rules defines talking on this page Am I right saying that everything is possible except forbidden  WPCIVIL WPNPAetc In the other wiki Ive seen this page for user behavior discussing describing but here is the other usage  u can talk and have dispute Am I right or not I think YES 
Ive started in wiki very difficult problem  military crimes starting from the best known for me RED ARMY CRIMES Im really newcomer and need some time to understand mechanisms of control and arguing
So Ive created the article about Red army crimes in Lithuania  we suffered personaly our granma was murdered in 1945 Some belorussian usually kind hearted people in military form having very strange understanding about military crimes he said the gun and government are responsible but not soldier havent left any coment by this article but started to mark for deletion my articles giving no any explanation  even I DONT LIKE THIS and THIS stub 

Thanks God some man from USA helped me talking  stand firm fighting against criminal war elements and go to discuss to Articlefordeletetion page
