I wish to echo Soap in encouraging you to stick with it and run again  Usually people are advised to wait at the least three months before running again but if you wait more than that it shows a lot of patience  I would definitely advise remaining active and running again  You are honestly a great candidate and if you are still interested in running in a couple of months you can feel free to approach me for a nomination if you so desire  If you dont want me to nominate you thats okyou can still count on my support  Best of luck  talk
