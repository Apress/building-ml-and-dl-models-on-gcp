For a guideline for the page we have 2 versions currently going around

Encyclopaedia Dramatica version httpwwwencyclopediadramaticacomindexphpThe_Wikipedia_Review
Wikinfo version httpwwwwikinfoorgwikiphptitleWikipedia_Review

There should be ample references flying around in the forum itself both the original version and the new version so it shouldnt be difficult to make a good article on it
