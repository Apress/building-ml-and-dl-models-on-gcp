WP is an international encyclopaedia  There are many legitimate science journals published in Australasia and Europe as well  Proponents need to find evidence of efficacy  Skeptics do not need to prove their position  I think your comments about the FDA are made without a sound basis  Claiming Americans are ignorant because they do not support a particular product is spurious  I look forward to reading third party independent research Thank you
