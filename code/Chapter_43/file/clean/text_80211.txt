Proposed Deletions 

I answered your query on my talk page  I think you may want to read the article wpprod as it clearly explains the criteria for prod  You will note there are 3 methods of deletion
1 Speedy which has strict criteria as it is the most powerful 
2 AFD which involves a mandatory 5 day discussion during which time no user is permitted to remove the AFD notice
3Prod By far the weakest proposal for deletion as ANY editor may remove the tag and the article may not be tagged again with the PROD template  The deletion proposal ends at the hand of one editor  Any editor may end the proposal during the minimum 5 day waiting period

My perspective if its not verifiable it shouldnt be in an encyclopedia  I would rather read a stub that has sources than a large detailed article that provides no evidence  As an editor its my choice if I want to try and improve an article or flag it for someone else to consider  Please respect my freedom to choose
