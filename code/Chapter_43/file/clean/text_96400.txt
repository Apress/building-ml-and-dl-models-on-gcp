Ironholds you blocked me with your banhammer Blockhammer I supposebut really consider how your personal pronoun sounds I got very little to say to you Mr Civility Police just this Scotty Wong and I could have handled our disagreement very well without someone running in to block people I dont much care for Scotty but Im sure theyre a grownup and I think I am too Actually I went to his talk page to see if he was still blocked if he was Id have unblocked him I would never block someone for saying something like what Scotty or I said You did and look what good it did us You said I believe that MF was lucky you werent on call when he called someone a fucking idiot I hope you find lots of things to do that dont involve administrative tools on Wikipedia since these kinds of blocks are just not helpful
