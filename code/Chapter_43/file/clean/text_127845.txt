Batta is used for kashmiri hindus 

The nonmuslims hindus by default in modern sense in kashmir valley especially brahmins were historically and still called Batta in kashmir valley as the word hindu was unknown to kashmiris It is only in recent times that kashmiri batta brahmins have started calling themselves hindus something which they always detested I never knew that Batta are also found in punjab and many khatris are derived from Batta caste surprising and interesting
