You are making a big mistake here The Yated articles are about the view of the Litvishe gedolim of Rav Ariel and the Temple Institute That is what they are for and they are accurate For quotes on the views of Litvishe gedolim you use a Litvish paper the Yated
For quotes on the views of Chassidishe gedolim such as Rav Halberstam you use HaEdah or such chareidi newspapers
For quotes on Zionist rabbis you use Arutz Sheva or Makor Rishon or such newspapers
There is no contradiction at all in using the Litvishe Yated for the views of Litvishe gedolim There is a problem in using Arutz Sheva for the views of those rabbis who hate detest despise Zionism Is that so difficult to understand   talk
