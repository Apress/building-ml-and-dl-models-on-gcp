It was Unfair that some of the senior editor of West Bengal Kolkata are not allowing latest pics to be added in Kolkata wiki page  

Its a open forum where every one has a right to speak up and post I was recently blocked by One of the senior editor of Kolkata Wikipedia forum from posting pics to Kolkata wiki page

I dont know why it is that The Kolkata wiki page is always having the same outdated pics

Last week on 9th May 2013 When I posted some pics of Kolkata Economy adding IT Infrastructure pics of Unitech Kolkata Technopolis DLF IBM Wipro  Some of the senior Kolkata wikipedians deliberately removed them giving useless excuses

Which I think is very unfair

So Do I need to make my own page now adding Kolkata IT Economy 

Really its hectic and dominating explaining reasons to some unwanted senior editors who always think their edit is correct and shouldnt me removed
