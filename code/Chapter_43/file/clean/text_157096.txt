Sysop

Congratulations After getting 100 support on RfA you are now an administrator You should read the relevant policies and other pages linked to from the administrators reading list before carrying out tasks like deletion protection banning users and editing protected pages such as the Main Page Most of what you do is easily reversible by other sysops apart from page history merges and image deletion so please be especially careful with those Good luck  2137 16 Jun 2004 UTC
