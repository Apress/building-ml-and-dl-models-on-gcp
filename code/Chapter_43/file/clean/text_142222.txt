I agree wholeheartedly It is in fact what brought me to this article  There simply was no hacking involved  That the mainstream media is ignorant of the proper usage of the term does not mean Wikipedia should repeat their mistakes  I dont think it takes anything away from the article to call it the Sarah Palin email breach  I find incident is too generic  Breach is both descriptive and correct  Ill wait a couple days and then Ill go ahead and make the changes  Similarly i intend to replace hacker with attacker where it occurs in the article
