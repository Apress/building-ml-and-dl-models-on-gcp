Adminship is not a lifelong appointment Any admin can be revoked if he does things that are not appropriate for an admin to do For example you misinterpreting my freedom of speech as being incivil is not an appropriate thing for an admin to do You threatening to block me for reminding you of your mortality is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do Your statements regarding the WikiProject Hawaii Manual of Style are WAY OFF You need to take a truth pill man There is no violation in editing an article when it specifically invites users to edit it Have you even looked at it Its not even an article Its a mere stub Its history page had only one entry before I contributed Nobody has touched that stub in over 7 months You said I changed it completely Thats FALSE Making FALSE statements is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do I did NOTHING that goes against the manual of style that was there There is NOTHING there that says dont make changes There is NOTHING at WikiProject Hawaii requiring a survey There has been NO TALK AT ALL on that MoS since the STUB was created Its been DEAD with NO CONTRIBUTIONS and NO USER INTEREST for over 7 months And now you criticize me for participating as a member of the Wikipedia community and as an expert on the Hawaiian language for making a positive contribution and bringing some LIFE to a dead neglected stub You need to review what Wikipedia is about Its not about treating admins as a superior race Admins are subject to the same rules as users Even the President of the USA is just a man Ryulong
