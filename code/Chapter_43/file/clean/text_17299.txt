PNRS human PNRS human PNRShuman The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the realworld thing it was supposed to analogize It isnt that we have detected PNRSs twice and found they were generated by humans therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human Rather the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRSs and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon Somewhere in the ID article it says that ID is not meant to replace insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process Those are PNRSs that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars not alien lifeforms The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet we have several other complex PNRSs that we know were created naturally so rather than leap to the conclusion that a designer created flagella science says no further information known Theres a concept that feels like you arent grasping here science is patient in the face of an unknown science deals with the unknown all the time But just because something is unknown doesnt mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself natural science has defined itself as empirical observable repeatable knowledge And thats worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries even though when the first natural scientists came about they knew practically nothing and everything was unknown from a rigorous scientific point of view If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent ID is so impatient to know that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like legitimate possibility or probable explanation Science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon
