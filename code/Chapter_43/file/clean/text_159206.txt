Hahahahaha  You cant relate Britons to Americans Canadians New Zealanders etc in the related ethnic groups box because your NOT talking about ethnic groups  You are talking about COUNTRIES POLITICAL BOUNDARIES not about ethnic groups  This article is about residents called Britons people born in or from Britain NOT an ethnic group For ethnic groups go to English Scottish Welsh Cornish people The ethnic group box is for ethnic groups not countries nationalities or citizenship
