Personal Experience 

Since there isnt much to this article or stub I thought I would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut I use it occasionally for insomnia In my opinion it is not a long term solution for insomnia Tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use I have never had a problem with withdrawal but I have heard that is possible but not life threatening just uncomfortable

Phenibut does has a long halflife so usage should be spaced out I would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions then a minimum of two days off One use a week would be preferable

It does work well for insomnia and tends to produce vivid dreams which is interesting but its usage should be carefully monitored

When used as directed I have heard of no major side effects It will increase the potency of sedatives so that must be kept in mind

This is just my own personal experience hopefully more people will add to the discussion
