This page is inaccurate 

It actually said that prior to 2002 the cough and cold variety of coro contained pseudoephedrine rather than chlorpheniramine maleate wtf seriously that is terrible I remember even way back in like 1999 when i used to pop the skittles it had chlorpheniramine i removed that there are a whole lot of other things on this page that need sourcesreferences
