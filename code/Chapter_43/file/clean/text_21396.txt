Beyond a general desire to have Wikipedia be the best most trustworthy source of information it can be I suppose because Im the one who created the page originally  Im also a reporter who covers Congress for a living so this is my bread n butter  Thanks for being a good sport while weve debated  I agree that WS so far has been impressive for a freshman but I am committed to the article remaining unbiased Also if at some point you come across some source material that says she led the debate Id want the page to reflect that  2320 Mar 22 2005 UTC
