Matt Sanchez response clarifications and demand for apology from Robertissimo

Robertissimo I beg to differ  The couple of mentions on Fox were full segments on the OReilly Factor a debate on Hannity and Colmes a full segment on Fox and Friends a segment on Neil Cavuto and another segment on ABC News an oped in the New York Post and the Marine Corps Post  I was given the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award principally because I not only defended myself in all these forums but Iaccording to the award citationupheld a standard of academic freedom in the face of adversity  I take great issue with your claim of my  admission in that article that he was also an escort  No such admission was made i was trying to make a rhetorical comparison between payment for porn as a proxy to a form of prostitution  I made this point on SEVERAL occasions on the Alan Colmes show  I was on Alans show four times  I take your statement as offensive cowardly counterproductive and demand an apology  I understand that wiki contributors are supposed to be much more subtle in their criticism however Robertissimosomeone to my knowledge that I have never methas shown great disdain for me by publicly calling me a liar prostitute or worsean imprecise writer  
If you Mr Robertissimo hold me in such low regard why are you interested in contributing to this article  Thats a fair question  If Mr Robertissimo refuses to apologize Id like some advice on how to handle this matter appropriately  Editors as the faceless Mr Robertissimo should keep in mind that I am a real person and not some wiki curiosity 

Robertissimos comments on the Marine Corps status shows an entire lack of knowledge of these type of procedures both formal and informal and his assessment is frankly simplistic  These issues have been discussed ad nauseum but angry activists still believe they can hurt me through this Wikipedia article  With all due respect to Mr Robertissimo none of which he has shown me where did he suddenly come from    Are we heading back toward editing wars as the dishonest and biased attempt to further their agenda  Given the history of this article and the number of frankly shady characters who have appeared and disappeared on this page my concerns are merited  

Out of curiosity why hasnt any emphasis been placed on further investigating the allegations made against me by UHaul and the Veterans organization The Marine Corps Times printed the allegations but I havent seen editors on this talk page bringing up that issue  It is disturbing distracting and tedious to have to defend myself from the likes of character such as Mr Robertissimo et alThis page was not meant for that purpose and I would like for civility to return  I fear there has been a further infiltration by former editors who had been resoundingly banned from these pages  Can anyone comment
Writing vs Edits  I originally cited a comparison between myself and Rich Merritt who happens to be my neighbor  I was told the Salon reading audience would not recognize the former pornstar alias USMC Captain Merritt   The Salon editor Mark Schone inserted Jeff Gannon as Mr Gannon is somewhat of a lightrod for the Salon readerships disdain  Ive made this statement before on at least three occasions please consult the archives  
In reality Merritts story is entirely dissimilar to my own as Merritt was performing in adult films while on active duty My last film of record was in the winter of 94 nearly a decade before my enlistment in the Marine Corps  The comparison between myself and Gannon is also passing at best as Jeff was considered to be a type of interloperdoppleganger with insider knowledge given to him surreptitiously from some shadowy figurenetwork within the Bush administration or the Republican party  In my case there was no doubt of my identity as a Marine my status as a student at Columbia University the subsequent changes that were effected in the student and city policy regarding the discrimination of veterans and the specific description of those veterans were all real and documented  I also had NO inside help or sway with any party or organization including unfortunately the Columbia Milvets organization  There was never a question that I wrote the articles I wrote nor was there a hint of some higher up working behind the scenes to help me  There was also never a doubt that I had merited the CPAC Award I was unanimously elected according to the events organizers  I was even congratulated for courage after standing up to the political roasting after unsourced bloggers revealed my past and attempted to link me rather poorly with an antigay rights agenda  The Gannon allegations of escorting were really just more red meat f
