Although Alexa Brown meets the minimum requirements for a separate article I believe that WPNs lead is relevant here Editors may use their discretion to merge or group two or more related topics into a single article is highly relevant  Creating separate pages for these tightly related subjects both causes editorial hassles trying to keep the two pages in sync and needing to decide whether a piece of information belongs on one page or the other and reduces the likelihood that a reader will get the whole story because most people will only read one of them  Also keeping it all here may reduce the temptation to use the biography for selfpromotion of the politically active parents andor their organization  IMO mergingnot splitting is the better answer
