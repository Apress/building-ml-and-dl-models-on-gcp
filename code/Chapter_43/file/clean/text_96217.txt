your interpretation of the above term is a perfect example of what I stated previously about only a decided court case can be referenced regarding the interpretation of legal terms I do not agree with your interpretation thus only an Indonesian court can decide the matter at hand  in the Indonesian case Even a specific law is not the final say only the interpretation of the courts of the stated law is the final say Thus only decided court cases can be referenced I agree with Chillum that it is better to avoid using the term illegal altogether
