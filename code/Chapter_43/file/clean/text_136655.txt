Im back
Hi there  Well I am back and I had the best time  Im paying for it now as Im exhausted but a couple of good nights sleep should fix the problem and then its back to the old grindstone for me  You asked for a rock so I brought one and not just any old rock either  Hope you like it   We went there one day  Personally I think I took a better photo of it  In fact I took about 50 from every possible angle but I havent uploaded anything and it was cloudy when we went so this one at least has a nice blue sky   Thanks for keeping an eye on some articles  I see Sharon Tate is up for discussion  I think another good example is Anne Frank  If Anne had lived her diary may never have even been published and had it been published it may have failed to attract the audience that it is has   Her notability is unquestionably linked not only to her death but the reaction to it   I dont attempt to put Sharon in the same category but the principal is the same  If she had lived her acting career may have fizzled to nothing but she didnt live and thats the whole point    To reduce either of them to a straightforward bio that ends with their deaths would be failing to adequately assess either of them
