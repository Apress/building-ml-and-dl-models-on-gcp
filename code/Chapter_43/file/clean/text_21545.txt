Some early books I have found on Google Books refer to is as Reform Judaism I am always corrected about this My point is that when you say all types of Judaism Orthodox Jews do not view Conservative Judaism as being any different than Christianity or Islam with regards to validity I fail to see the difference between simply making a page titled Religion of Monotheism which includes Judaism Christianity Islam Reformed Judaism Conservative Judaism etc Just like Judaism and Christianity do not share a same page so too Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism should not share the same page as they are two completely separate religions There is already a Monotheism page and I do not see why Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism cannot both be addressed there
