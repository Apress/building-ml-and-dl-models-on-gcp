Wow a preemptive attack on an article in preperation for an AfD Unfortunately quite miseleading Hope others dont pay it much heed  
 No evidence of notability of this film False Notability has been asserted and sourced FURTHER the statement seems to absolutely ignore the sorces provided which in toto amount to enough to meet WPNF and WPGNG This Week Columbus Dispatch Athens News and ABC News all qualify as indepth coverage from reliable sources 
 No reviews by nationallyknown reviewers or publications  Misleading as it does not automatically apply A cult horror satire film by independent filmmakers is unlikely to be reviewed by Siskel and Ebert much less those publications that cater to only bigname bigbudget highly touted blockbusters Wikis guideline recognizes that sources may be considered for what is being sourced and accepts that an indepth review of film and filmmakers by Cranked on Cinema is from experts in the field qualified to voice an opinion about the subject
 even the socalled New York Times reference is in fact to All Movie Guide Gee WHy mislead with that The New York Times was not used to source notability neither was the use of Turner Classic Movies Again you are misleading a reader who might best be told that these 2 reliable sources were used to WPVerify some of the articles noncontentious facts like existance of film or of cast  crew which is expected and demanded by guideline AND policy  specially since notability has already been established by significant coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject but thanks for the hint about AMG I can now add it as well
 The fact that it is the first feature completed by Ohio State students is not an indication of notability  False as it is for them and quite specifically meets the criteria set by WPGNG even though it is only a secondary and supported claim toward overall notability
 it is not an assertion that it is the first feature completed by university students would there be an automatic bypass of notability requirements for the first feature completed by students of every college or university This misleading WPWAX argument is not about this article only about some hypothetical article The sourced minor assertion is that this is the first for Ohio University Not for any others Why not handle those article ifwhen they show up There is no request being made here for a bypass of notability requirements for some other mythical set of as yet unwritten articles Notability here has been asserted and proven Period
