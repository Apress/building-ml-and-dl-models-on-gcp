not an attack 

dear jeff I had this message removed it is not an attack but I do want an apology for your behaviour listen buddy I dont know what that email you sent me was but Idont like that sort of talk coming into my house  you might like to watch robobabes and other fleshhoneys doing depraved things and putting opbjects into them but me and my family certainly dont  Now it so happens that was a SHARED email address  one that all my family use and the idea that my daughter could have gone onto the email and looked at pictures like that makes me heartily sick and the fact htat youre some kind of responsible man on the wikipedia I used to have faith in wikipedia I used to think it was a useful thing but to get an email from you linked to this website and all the pictures you attached  not to mention the links to all sorts of faces splattered in the worst kind of bodily fluids and excretions this mighht be your chance to turn the enciclopedia into a den of perversion and pornography Its not that there were the pictures on here  I can understandf if I wanted to look an article about some kind of deviant practice  but why would you send that to me here you should be stripped of the medals you have so proudly on your page  in the army we used to have a word for people like you and I wouldnt want to print it here If i dont get an apology this goes right to the top
