Edit 25 Nov 07
The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had deleted weasel words tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History I wouldnt be surprised if they hadnt read the work The SH does indeed claim to report rather than report scandals in Justinians reign the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable viz that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author thats why I let stand the deletion of apparently The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned since that particular word is a weasel word on the part of some Wikipedia editor But the socalled revelations are indeed titillating and doubtful rather than revealing and revealing revelations is very bad copy editing too Similarly again given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinians behest or something like it stet All of this is ground well traveled by the various editors of the work over the centuries and represents the clear consensus of modern scholars
