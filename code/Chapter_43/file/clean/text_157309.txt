Help with logo 
Ive created an SVG version of the universal binary logo the cool yinyang kind of thing shown here httpwwwapplecomuniversal  but Im not into the whole licensing thing with copyrights and such

In fact I barely knew how to post to this discussion board Ha ha All I know is that SVG is pretty much everywhere on Wikipedia and I was bored one day so I made it using Inkscape

So if anyones interested in work with me on that just post a reply or something Ill check this discussion board every week or so

Thanks for your help guysgirls 6613016181
