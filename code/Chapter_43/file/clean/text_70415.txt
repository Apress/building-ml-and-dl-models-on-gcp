NOMEX used in Apollo 1 suit 

The article states This version A1C added a white NOMEX cover layer from the G4C and G5C suits The Nomex page calls it a flameresistant material commonly used in racing and firefighting equipment and says it was first marketed in 1967 The Apollo 1 fire burned through Grissoms Whites and Chaffees suits Now conditions were extreme more than one full atmosphere of pure oxygen so it might be possible the NOMEX would burn in those conditions but Ive never seen the suits described as anything other than nylon in any of the literature On a second reading I see NOMEX is referred to in the Gemini suits so you couldnt really say it was added for A1C therefore Im just removing it However there is no citation of the NOMEX
