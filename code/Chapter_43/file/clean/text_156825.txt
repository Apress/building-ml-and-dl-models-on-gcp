The result was Speedy keep The reasons given for deletion do not fall into the normal criteria for template deletion listed at the top of this page A simple review of the templates would have shown that any alleged accessibility problems would need to be dealt with by a change in the behaviour of classabbr in MediaWiki and are therefore not a topic for discussion here That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here The disruption was completely predictable given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once The speedy keep does not imply any judgment on the accessibility questions raised in the discussion which should be addressed in more appropriate fora  talk 
I have no objection to this being closed as keep as there was consensus in that direction but that was a provocative and insulting closure notice
Firstly it seems youre yet another person who has never actually bothered to read WikipediaSpeedy keep as your reasons for speedy keeping are at odds with what is written there Secondly it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility Thirdly the whole point of the  template is for it to be transcluded with the template in order to advertise the discussion If I had noincluded it I might well have been accused of trying to hide the discussion Therefore your suggestion that I did not conduct the most simple research is a great steaming load of crap
It is pretty obvious from the hostile tone of your response together with the fact that youre deeply involved in chemistry articles that you didnt like the nomination and decided to speedy close the discussion instead of just saying your piece and waiting for an unbiased closure That is a misuse of your administrative privileges
And before you discard this discussion as just another rant by a disgruntled troll you might note that Ive been here as long as you have and Ive been an administrator as long as you have Hesperian
