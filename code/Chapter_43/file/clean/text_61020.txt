Low Weald 

Hi Peter I see you have made various edits to the Weald Holmesdale etc As someone with a mainly geological interest I tend to look on the Weald rather loosely as the big hole in the chalk Would you count Holmesdale as part of the Low Weald or should this be restricted to the rim of Weald Clay around the High Weald
