The fact that the students in Waldorf schools in California have personal exemptions from immunizations at a higher rate than the state average is fact verified by the State of California statistics which I refd  In Sonoma County the exemption rate is 52 for the private school 71 for one charter school and 88 for the other  The state average for personal exemptions is less than 2  Moving to the rest of the state provides similar numbers  The schools can claim that this is not an official policy but I did not argue that it is official policy only that the numbers are true and that they are verifiable

My edits have been deleted with the argument that the verifiable truth of individual school and county data is not relevant to a movement of over 1000 schools   So from my point of view true and verifiable information about a significant component of life in Waldorf schools is being suppressed on wikipedia
