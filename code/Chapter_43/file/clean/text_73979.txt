Johnbull  despite Vaquero100s one man campaign to reclaim the name Catholic Church for his employer it is not polite to revert his edits without discussing first  In this case I think he is justified to use Catholic Church and Henry was a devout Catholic as when referring to 1510 that was unambiguous  However I think the external authority of the Catholic Church is a very clumsy phrase when all that is meant was the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff   Many other things changed in the English Reformation but the only thing that changed as regards external authority over the English Church was that the Pope was replaced with the Supreme Governor English monarch
