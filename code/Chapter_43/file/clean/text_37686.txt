Why is it surprising that USGS calls it a gut  Sloughs are often guts  There is nothing in this article that indicates it is anything but a gut or slough not an estuary  The friends may be a reliable source who knows Im told that if 3 blogs say something in agreement it can be considered reliable information  If there are no reliable sources that say its an estuary that  information should be removed  I would tag it as inaccurate but I am under threat of permanent community ban if I should question facts on Wikipedia in articles  Its your article you want to call a slough an estuary okay  I would just like readers to know its unsourced information that appears to have nothing in the article backing it up  Ive done that  I wash my hands of this inland stagnant water estuary
