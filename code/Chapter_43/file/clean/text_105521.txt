Date of death
I remember in the days following his death there was colossal confusion in the press about exactly which date he died on  And it seems to be continuing here  

The lede says unambiguously he died 28 April  But later on we have this
 On the sic 28 April 1992 at 417 pm Francis Bacon was admitted to the Handmaids of Maria a private clinic in Madrid where he had been holidaying  He died of cardiac arrest at 900 am the following morning attempts to resuscitate him having failed

Unless Im insane that means he died on 29 April  Either that or someones royally stuffed up the datesin this section of the article 

Whats it to be folks  Even the Irish cant have it both ways     your turn
