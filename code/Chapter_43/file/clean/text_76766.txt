Regarding delete of my user page 

Dear Anthony Bradbury
You have delete my user page for Unambiguous advertising or promotion About of an user what content will be there without himself I also written about me in the page so why deleted my page If the page violate any Wikipedia policy you can edit it like others pages But without notice an older page is deleted its is not desirable So I would request to restore the page by deleting the Unambiguous advertising or promotion that you think inappropriate Thank you Emdadul Huq
