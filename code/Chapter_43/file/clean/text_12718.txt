Hi Pterantula

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references  For example the studies of the effects of Landmark Education is from the thirdparty surveys  If instead the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable  Weve gone around in circles on that many times as well

As well the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education with rebuttals in many cases

As for litigation I am aware of five outbound cases

Preemptive warning

1 Traci Hukill The Est of Friends 1998 preemptive warning no suit filed

Actual litigation outbound

 Elle Magazine   1998 LE achieved no result
 Cynthia Kisser  1997 LE won retraction
 Margaret Singer 1997 LE won retraction
 Rick Ross       2005 LE cancelled suit for product disparagement

There are about three inbound cases against LE
 Stefanie Ney court ruled in LEs favor
 Been versus Weed 2002 10 claims 3 settled 7 dropped  LE was a crossdefendent
 Tracy Neff 1997 sexual harrassment settled out of court  LE lacked a sexual harrassment policy at the time and got pulled in on this

Does anyone have anything more than this from LEs inception in 1991 14 years ago  Litigation regarding est should be on the est page   For a company with 70 million in revenue and over 800000 customers of the Landmark Forum this is a tiny amount of litigation
