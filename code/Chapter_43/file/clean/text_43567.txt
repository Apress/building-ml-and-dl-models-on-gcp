British Empire
The British Empire appears to be a strong entity and retains its territories in Africa and Asia although Canada Australia and New Zealand have split from the Empire and are closely allied to the United States Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Windsor who claims the British Crown from Edward VIII reside in Canada speaking out against the Greater German Reich Germancontrolled Europe and the puppet British regime However Great Britain is afforded a great deal of respect from the German Reich as its Empire and historical institutions were greatly admired by Adolf Hitler and German society in general even in the years before World War II

Apart from the bit about Canada I dont recall any of this from the book Nor do I recall any mention of German presence in Antartica Can someone show the references from the book to back up these claims
