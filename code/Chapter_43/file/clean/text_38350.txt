Reversion of PFS Conference 

Since JDWOLFF is being a Wikipedia Nazi I have moved discussion to the talk page  In my opinion the information I have included is very germane and significant  It demonstrates not only that medical practitioners are taking PostFinasteride Syndrome seriously but also informs to those who may be suffering from negative persistent side effects from Propecia and Proscar that there are current ongoing studies  While it may not be apparent on this Wikipedia article because JDWOLFF is very aggressive to remove comments he doesnt like there is an ongoing controversy relating to the side effects of taking Propecia  Many men have disregarded the claims since a handful of doctors remain ignorant to the potential risks of the drug and have been misinforming their patients only to lead additional patients to suffer what seems to be permanent side effects  Please state your case as to why the information about the conference should not be included or else I would put it back up

Additionally I do not believe that JDWOLFFs edits were in good faith was was suggested in the edit page  His excessively hostile tone in commenting on his edits shows he is bringing more emotion than rational thought to the discussion
