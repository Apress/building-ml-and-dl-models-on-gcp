a I am the owner of the website being cited and I can assure you that it is not engaged in directly making money off the content 

b I fail to see how briefly citing a post on the site harms me or anyone else

b If youre still worried about having permission to use a memorial about a member of Minneapolis Friends Meeting even though I dont understand why have the author contact Minneapolis Monthly Meeting and see if its all right with them I would be surprised if they were to object
