Vandalism madeup player 

Hi there SNOWMAN VASCO here

I bring to you a guy who needs to be immediately sent offWell maybe well show a yellow card to the user but his creation needs to receive marching orders as soon as possible

Take a look at this invented player Cristiano Sonko in FC Porto it does not appear in the teams article but it did display in the SQUAD TEMPLATE until a while ago i was able to find the template and revert it still dont know how to remove the article If you look closely the madeup players fullname CRISTIANO SONKO DOS SANTOS AVERIO is a vandalic pun on Manchester Uniteds CRISTIANO RONALDO DOS SANTOS AVEIRO replacing RONALDO with SONKO and misspelling AVEIRO I checked several sites and there is no SONKO playing either for PORTO or PAÃ‡OS DE FERREIRA youth or senior as the storyline and infobox state its just NOT TRUE

Also for further proof this is idiotic vandalism take a look at this article creators talkpage a fellow by the name ZANRAMON ELITE httpenwikipediaorgwikiUser_talkZanramon_elite Please have a look at it man and remove it or ask someone to do so i do not know how to proceed

Cheers from Portugal VASCO AMARAL
