My response to Mr Nathanael corcerning his astrological beliefs along with his biased and bossy behavior in wikipedia

The problem with Mr Nathanael is that loves to act like a self proclaimed Administrator here in wikipedia and deleting even reliable sources from other members that contradict his own personal beliefs or his friends from his picked sources and i am not talking only about deleting Astrologyonline but other sources too that i citated and Mr Nathanael try to delete them with some unjustified cheap excuse 

Here is one example below of Mr Nathanael bossy behavior here in wikipedia from the Scorpio History page when i contributed a reliable source from Kelli Fox A professional Astrologer as i clearly pointed him with a url of her homepage

From when Mr Nathaniel became our boss and a judge here in wikipedia
