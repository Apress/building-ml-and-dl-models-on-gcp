This is why I support Natalyas first option in particular regard to Abtract and CollectonianThe parties may not edit at all any page that the other party has been involved in editing recentlywith perhaps 50 editstwo weeks being the definition It stops them coming into contact If Abtract and Sesshomaru want to work informally to Abtracts formula and Collectonian notes Abtracts areas of interests then it simply means they dont report each other The original restriction remains with Natalyas new wording so that any future disagreement can be resolved back to those principles it may avoid a party trying to redefine what the informal agreement means Also I dont see any reason for a time limit  if it works it stays As regards being thin skinned or not I might not have looked recently but Im pretty sure this is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit and not those with particular epidermis qualities I think this is what we are aiming for

As regards bringing this to a wider review I think there have been various postings to the admin boards in the past and what we are doing here is the result of that I dont see what taking it back yet again will achieve If we cant sort it here then I think we are left with WPRfAR  since this is exactly what that body was created for
