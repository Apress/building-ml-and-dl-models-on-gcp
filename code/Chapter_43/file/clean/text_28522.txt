The problem with linking up Basaevs claim with VK going to the training camp is that the two sources claim he was already at the camp long before the burial This one says he joined the camp at the end of 2002 В конце 2002 года Ходов кудато пропал  сказал наш собеседник  Сейчас мы установили что тогда он вместе с еще 30 боевиками прошел обучение на одной из баз террористов под названием Талибан Она располагалась неподалеку от села Галашки At the end of 2002 he just landed somewhere  a Russian phrase meaning  we lost track of him  now we have established said our interlocutor that at that time together with 30 fighters he went trough training at one of the terrorist bases called Taliban It was situated not far from the village of Galashki It seems he was allowed out for the burial but in company see below

I also found the Trud article which claims a temporary separation or even state of divorce of the parents 

There is more interesting info in this article
1 Aleksandra was married before Анатолий усыновил трехлетнего ребенка Александры от первого брака Владимира 
2 At School Number One Vladimir was horribly ambitious and looked dosn on the other kids of his age Там у Владимира проявились болезненная амбициозность и презрительное отношение к ровесникам
other sources claim Boris was a hooligan so he differed from the kids his age in the opposite way
3 No info on the father after their return but since other sources claim among other things that Anatoly often visited his son in jail and was convinced he was innocent I think they again lived together
4 Vladimir did not arrive at the funeral on his own but in the company of two bearded friends one of whom villagers later recognized amongh the dead Beslan hostage takers Да не один а в компании двух никому не знакомых бородачей  одного из них потом эльхотовцы опознали среди убитых в Беслане террористов
5 After the Islamic funeral VK went back to the village and pushed the tables with drinks around referring to Islamic law and threatened to shoot the people gathered there Вернувшись в село где начинались поминки Ходов попытался перевернуть столы с выпивкой ссылаясь на законы фундаментального ислама И даже пригрозил расстрелять собравшихся
6 The journalist asked the Militia minister of Northern Ossetia whether the freeing of VK proved that he had powerful protectors in  the local police department ROVD I do not exclude that possibility Я не исключаю такой возможности  ответил мне Сослан Иванович
7 Aleksandra already left Elkhotovo before the village council decide to banish her According to rumours she went to live with someone she knew in Vladikavkaz Ну а мать террористов еще до решения сельского схода уехала из Эльхотова По слухам она перебралась к знакомым во Владикавказ Vladikavkaz is the capital of North Ossetia I doubt very much that a village council has the right to banish someone from North Ossetia

About the letter of the 30 to Komsomolskaya Pravda  I have never before put a text in Wikisource I suppose this should go into the Russian version I do not find there any heading where it looks normal to put a letter to a newspaperUser_talkPan_Gerwazypgp
