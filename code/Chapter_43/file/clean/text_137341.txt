Paulskirchenverfassung 

Ping on TalkPaulskirchenverfassungTitle_of_this_article I think the article should be renamed to something in English in the interim I do not think the debate for changing it back to Paulskirchenverfassung from something like Frankfurt Constitution would hold much sway which makes it evident to me it can be changed safely
