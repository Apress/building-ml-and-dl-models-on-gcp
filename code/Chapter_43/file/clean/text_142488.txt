The problem being my friend that you are not a specialist in that field and have been posting for over a month in YBMs private forums and are a very big fan and socket puppet of his
The second problem being that your extensiv scientifical evidencies well supplied above contain absolutly nothing who dont have been mentioned and I should say supposed earlier already at the beginning of 2004 and abundently refutated since and that all those counterproofs dismantled all the attacks from the scientifical part of the accusators and that it was then agreed that it was more a question of specialisation differences than of direct misunderstanding of existing theories or gross ignorancies of basic physic
Thats what make Cosmology a specific part of advance physic
Your field being not Cosmology nor Higher physic nor Theoretical Physic it will have been better if you had first consulted with a collegue from the department of Theoretic Physic before you posted here or even before you made up your opinion about the Bogdanovs work
You made already plenty of that kind of mistakes also in the french wiki about this case and no we are not impress at your ability to repeat yourself and others statements without correction alredy brought by other scientifics
