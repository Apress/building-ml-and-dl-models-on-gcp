I think there is a confusion about what the LDS project tag means It doesnt mean or imply that this is directly connected to the church that there is an official relationship or anything of the sort It doesnt even show anything on the article page at all It simply marks the topic as something related to Mormonism and therefore of interest to the editors working on LDSrelated articles Considering that one of the most prominent allegations against West Ridge is that it is a Mormon gulag it most certainly appears likely that the LDS wikiproject might be interested in this page Again to reiterate this changes nothing on the article page so I dont see what the concern is
