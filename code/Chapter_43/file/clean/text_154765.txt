Evade Indefinite Toton Is this a joke Who authorized you to delete my second unblock appeal to the previous 72h block by Joy that was posted right above Both blocks by Joy were obviously cases of WikipediaINVOLVEDInvolved_admins so you had to unblock Instead you deleted my clearcut unblock request and came up with this Toton character gig so that you can block me indefinitely Smartly done I mean how you did this First provoke the enemy into a conflict by revising their contributions repeatedly without any discussion to make them frustrated Then entrap the enemy right after 4th reversal as you dont assume the enemys good faith Finally you make up a reason for indefinite block Easy as 123 Hats down Wow what an experience Good thing I had already reported you and Joy much before this and youre being investigated
