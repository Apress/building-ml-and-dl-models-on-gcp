The comment about Alonso being comprehensively  out raced by Trulli in 2004 isnt backed up by the facts Taking the first 10 races Alonso finished ahead of Trulli three times Trulli finished ahead of Alonso four times and one or both failed to finish in the other races  43 is hardly a comprehensive result  Though I dont think anyone can argue about the same comment on qualifying
