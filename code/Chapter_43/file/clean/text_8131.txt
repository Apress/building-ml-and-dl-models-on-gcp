Surtsicna has a very good point and I wholeheartedly New France was a colony Colonies are not independent states and thus by definition dont have a Head of State be it a President or a Monarch Elizabeth II for example is not Queen of the Falkland Islands because no such office exists and the Falklands are not an independent state Francois Hollande is not President of French Guiana because French Guiana is a French overseas department and so on Again colonies cannot have a Head of State by definition

Canada after 1867 of course was not a colony legally had a monarchy separate from that of the UK and thus 1867 really should be the cutoff point

Monarchs who ruled the country that was the colonial power that colonized Canada is not the same thing as Monarchs of Canadaincluding the French monarchs and the UK monarchs prior to 1867 makes as much sense as having a list of the British monarchs prior to 1776 on the page List of Presidents of the United States
