I am not inclined to consider flipping  But Ill ask again right now if someone would please tell us whether the subject of the BLP expressed to Jimbo Wales a general preference about how she wants to be publicly known versus a mere preference about how this Wikipedia article should be named  I have asked twice at Jimbos talk page twice  As things stand I would just go with what reliable sources say about prevalent use and with what reliable sources say about her own use of her name which together strongly support the move
