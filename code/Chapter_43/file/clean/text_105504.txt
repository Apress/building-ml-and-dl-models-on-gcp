Oh you dont say I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a MuslimChristian conflict And no once again you are very biased and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith Yes there were Europeans the west what were they then Africans Asians that part of the world is called Europe The crusaders came from all over Europe so get that right for starters And let me tell you this these muslims who were invading Byazantinian lands were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians These pleaing byzantinians along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs hence the celebration of sunday rather than the jesuit saturday sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans The cross a pagan roman signnever adopted by jesus the fish a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans the trinity the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etcwere massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel which weree written fairly shortly after Jesuss ascentnot the centuries old heavily altered versions you follow These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam because they knew Mohammad was their prophet as prophesized by Jesus The byzantinians romans were killing them and there familys and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics so the mass population who were invaded by romans were indeed monotheistic Unitarians The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians Even under Islamic rule the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east
Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans and its people liberated by the Muslims
And were YOU aware that the inquisition which by the way you put it acted independantly from the churchstop lying the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyoneas seen by the call to the crusades You are an apologetic not muslims everything was done in the name of the church why even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying themYou claim it has nothing to do with the churchand I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope where did you get that rubbish from dont put words in my mouthhowever up until the 18th 19th century the bodies and skeletons of muslims and heretics killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches The church is the one who deems people as heretics and is the one who approved of the killings full stop Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced obviously unlike you
And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews well what do you mean THE pope dont you mean A pope there were many you know And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they logically shouldnt kill other people like barbarians Im not doubting you but it would be helpful if you could mention the name Again dont go off the topic this was about hte inquisition
And yes I bloomin love life under Islam as a woman I feel liberated and free and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented the crank shaft tall buildings dur to architectural techniques education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours merit was becasue of knowledge and not wealth and there is so much more that is owed to them basically we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman christianity when they invaded us I love Islam and YOU are showing everybody how ignorant YOU are by exposing your complete lack of knowledge and trying to stray off the arguame
