Question about human name dabs 

This question concerns two disambig guidelines 1 a disambig page should not include a red link unless the editor is confident that the subject is notable enough for an article but 2 red links should be included for items that link to the disambig page without any of the available options in mind The page Ive been working on is Dave Johnson All the redlinked names fit guideline 2that is each is linked in an article to Dave Johnson but is not one of 
the bluelink Dave Johnsons But some of them are not really notable the comicbook artist probably yes the minorleague ice hockey player the Survivor contestant and the two software guys probably no So whats the best way to handle this Leave the nonnotable red links Or go to the articles in which they are linked and unlink them Or something else As before any advice welcome  Talk
