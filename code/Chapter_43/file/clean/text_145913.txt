The misleading map
Ladies and gentlemen I find the map at the top of the article nice but totally misleading considering the fact that it is in Russian and doesnt indicate the mine itself If the contributor who added it is willing to help hed better redesign the image keeping only the city and the names of the oblast and the countries The real need here is for a collage of world map showing Ukraine and Ukraines map indicating Donetsk like those graphics in TV newscasts Thanks
