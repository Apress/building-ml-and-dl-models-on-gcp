So a third pornography industry advocate has joined this correspondence which increases the number of participants but actually decreases its importance in my affairs as well as the relevance of Wikipedia in important matters regarding the health of our society it is lamentably our society I only wish I could call it your society  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased  If you really want to avoid bias just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow who not surprisingly has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry  Wikipedia a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control peoples opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health  Quite a question to ponder  But my point on bias is that every author is biased  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody in theory it can be but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain wellorganized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information  The author of this webpage who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States is biased  His or her comments on Lubbens religious views clearly betray that sentiment as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia  And you dont need to tolerate anything from me any longer because I will stop now or maybe I wont I guess it depends on just how much time Im willing to waste communicating with you  This is becoming Dostoevskian Underground Man give it a read sometime it might help youVeritas Semper   But you and I both know where the truth lies in this matter  There is no need for an arbitrator who again would be mistakenly be labeled an unbiased third party
