Except that it actually doesnt At larger resolutions the image layout that I fixed would cause edit links to bunch up andor be hidden and the pictures to do exactly what you are complaining about with stacking Forcing sections to clear prevents that from happening Yes it introduces more whitespace at some resolutions but it makes seeing the edit links much simpler at all resolutions which is a good thing outweighing minor whitespace problems Given that at certain resolutions your layout actually hides all the editsection links your layout is unintentionally bad making it harder for people to edit I have accordingly reverted Sorry to be reverting you like that but the ability of people to easily edit the page overrides minor cosmetic concerns
