September 14 1814 

O say can you see by the dawns early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that starspangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

  

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore that the havoc of war and the battles confusion a home and a country should leave us no more Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave And the StarSpangled Banner in triumph doth wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
