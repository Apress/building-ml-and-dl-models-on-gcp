Yes you have a point there I humbly excuse for those edits related to 1 and 3 as theyre doubtable As for 2 I added alleged CIA operative in the article It is more accurate than cult depogrammer although no such titleprofession at all would suffice too What cults or cult members has he deprogrammed The word cult is out of context My edits with regard to 4 are at least better than the previous state Note that point 4 is proven by Project Monarch entry and various of its sources on bottom It is therefore completely bogus to say that CoB and MP are somehow the only source 2 and 4 in CoB entry were inconsistent with PM entry The article is now more accurate according to Wikipedias policies IMO Have a look and a nice day or 2
