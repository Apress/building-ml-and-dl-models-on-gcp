ll see what I can do to help downstream    

The natural abundance background is important to the diagnostic power of many isotopic labeling and low blank traceelement detection techniques as well  For example a colleague of mine irradated a nanogram sized particle with so many neutrons that every U235 atom in it was fissioned and then counted the number of fission tracks that resulted  He found one which in turn allowed him to infer U238 abundance assuming solar system abundance ratios and hence total U abundance in the particle as well
