We have a color for Altaic just as we have a color for other nongenetic groups such as Papuan and American in order to keep the number of colors at a manageable level  But most linguists have never been convinced of the validity of Altaic as a genetic group and the majority of linguistics simply view it as a Sprachbund  I doubt that further research will reveal anything more convincing  The notion of Altaic has been around for 60something or more years and has failed to convince the majority of historical linguists in that time  Its not like were dealing with unknown languages and simply lack enough data  Altaic is likely never to be demonstrated to be a valid genetic grouping
