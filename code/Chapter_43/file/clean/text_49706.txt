IMAGE DELETIONS 

Carnildo says you deleted two images from the article httpenwikipediaorgwikiRay_Joseph_Cormier that were posted by another WikipediA Administrator httpenwikipediaorgwikiUserEarl_Andrew Is there a hierarchal structure system among Administrators so one can overrule another without discussion

One image showed the subject of the article wearing the gag Fear of the Truth over his mouth as he was beat up and removed from the Visitors Gallery of the Canadian House of Commons on the first day of televised debate in history That would make it an image associated with history in Canada at least

Understanding WikipediA respects copyrite restrictions the tag applied to the deleted images reads as follows

Because the image is historically significant the entire image is needed to identify the subject properly convey the meaning and branding intended and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image Low resolution

The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original Copies made from it will be of inferior quality unsuitable for uses that would compete with any commercial purpose of the photograph Purpose of use

Identification and critical commentary in the article a subject of public interest It makes a significant contribution to the users understanding of the article which could not practically be conveyed by words alone The image is placed next to the associated material discussing the work to show the primary visual image associated with the work and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for Replaceable

Because the image depicts a nonreproducible historic event there is almost certainly no free equivalent Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended would tarnish or misrepresent its image or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary Other information Use of the historic image in the article complies with Wikipedia nonfree content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above The image meets general Wikipedia content requirements and is encyclopaedic

It will take some time before the Article is so widely known by the public there is a 0 probability any newspaper will want to claim copyvio considering the subject

Will you please undo what you did until there is a free and fair discussion by users If there is any tag that could be associated to the disputed images to stimulate discussion do that The Editors of the Ottawa Citizen have been aware of its images on the Article since they were posted by Earl Andrew
