You know this has already been debated and it was determined that putting neutralizing language into the article was the best way to address this issue  The infobox says founder Traditionally Jesus date est to be the year 30  This passed the GA for NPOV  It was POV to say anything else especially since our main source  the National Geographic says Peter was the first Pope  We dont have anything better to give us a better date
