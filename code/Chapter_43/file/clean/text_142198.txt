Like hell it will be youre all far too slow and cannot see what is going on or where the future lies Sceptre will be banned only from his most obvious prime target considering how slow the community is in recognising Sceptres behaviour to the point of obtuseness Sceptre will simply disperse and spread the exact same behaviour into other areas and with that less focused approach Sceptre will continue permanently to undermine the project But hey thanks for taking 60 seconds out of you busy commute was it  to judge the entire issue Brilliant work These systems filter out the good editors whilst collecting the cream of the crap    2352 21 Jun 2012 UTC
