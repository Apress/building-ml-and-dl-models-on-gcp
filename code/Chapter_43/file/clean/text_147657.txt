Interlude Page Review 

Hello and thank you for taking the time to review Interludes page I just have some questions about why the page was rejected You mention that I treat it as notable in its own right and that references are about Interlude and not on the campaigns per se In terms of reference I included sources such as Fast Company TechCrunch Yahoo News and TIME so Im not sure I understand the comment Additionally the page follows the format of other entries Ive seen for example httpsenwikipediaorgwikiDroga5 It would be extremely helpful if you could provide more detail on how I could improve the entry and have my submission approved Thanks
