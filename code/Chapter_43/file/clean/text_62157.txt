Hey you better mind your tone Bwilkins   you dont have to sit in judgement of that Its between Ron and myself If he minds my presence he could always say so himself I am not here to fight a war of acrimony I was in the middle of a discussion This is Rons userpage Whats your problem if I want to discuss things with Ron I will do what I feel like doing you dont tell me what to do I dont need your assistance now otherwise I would have visited your talk page not Rons BWilkins I would advice you to not poke your nose in where youre unneeded Ron is a capable administrator and presumably he can handle himself 
  I really dont give a rats behind about what you found You leave me alone I dont care if your views are correct or not I dont care I am willing to talk to Ron and anybody else but you here
