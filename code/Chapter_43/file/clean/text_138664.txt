That is ridiculous The post that I restored said
Viriditas appears to be a bit confused about the difference between original research and a pertinent observation regarding some apparent vandalism of the main article WPOR does not require us to leave our brains at the door See 
It was in reply the post of UserViriditas which uses almost identical language saying
I have no opinion either way but your comments above and your selfpublishing of a classified list of vital sites from a leaked WikiLeaks cable tells me that you are a bit confused about original research and how we write articles from the secondary sources See 
I fail to see how any of this is anywhere near deserving of an immediate 2week block without notice or warning or reason What on Earth is going on
