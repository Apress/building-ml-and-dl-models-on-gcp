Survey

Hi Fuzzypink

I have put together a survey for female editors of Wikipedia and related projects in order to explore in greater detail womens experiences and roles within the Wikimedia movement Itd be wonderful if you could participate

Its an independent survey done by me as a fellow volunteer Wikimedian It is not being done on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation I hope youll participate

Just click this link to participate in this survey via Google

Any questions or concerns feel free to email me or stop by my user talk page Also feel free to share this any other female Wikimedians you may know It is in English but any language Wikimedia participants are encouraged to participate
I appreciate your contributions  to the survey and to Wikipedia Thank you
