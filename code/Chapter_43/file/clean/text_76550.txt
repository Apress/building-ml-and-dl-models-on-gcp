Vandalism You call my changing the Apollo articles to read the facts for a few seconds vandalism huh you stupid crackwhore Ya well the mere existence of those Neil Armstrong fairy tales and maniacs who are still deluding themselves into thinking shit like that could have actually occured in 1969 is the ultimate vandalism of human culture on this planet in general I looked into this Apollo nonsense in greater detail than I would have liked to To the extent of trying to correspond with NASA There is no such thing as a Neil Armstrong or anybody else actually going to the moon anytime soon nevermind the 60s If you look carefully at these socalled TV broadcasts of those events they look as outrageously unrealistic and disgustingly fake as Ed Wood movies But hey why listen to me when you can keep right on regurgitating your appaller space balonies and other lies Thats how science and wikipedia works
