Why too much Brianyoumans Who decide this is too much and this is the limit  too much or not too much This is I think a capitulation form WP in front of NPOV User there because only this users see this as hostile but what is with the thousands of Serbs who life there with their neighbours not only in Vukovar Is this not hostile when they have no vocie because of NPOV users on WP You think Vukovar is the end No So if you think this is too much brother than we must remove also the Hungarina and other langauges from the Infobox in Subotica Srbobran ect in every single Serbian place like in Croatia the Croatian names I think thats fair Dont forget the other countrys ect Is this the solution Brian Because of this NPOV Users there i  Vukovar who nobody charged In Serbia not one day during the war and after the war and also now atack buildings with croatian or hungarian translation or names till today To capitulate and to forget the croatian EUlaw who gave the premission to use the latin and the serbiancyrillic eaquel on administartiv niveau ect where life a significant Serbian minority or majority Me and you know thats can be the right way to capitulate and to forgat the law and the WPRules
