Bandai and Nintendo 

On the packaging of a number of Nintendo consoles the Bandai logo was printed This was the case for at least the European version of the NES Gameboy and SNES Does anyone know why the logo is on the packaging of these consoles The only reason I can think of is that maybe Bandai could have distributed the consoles in Europe
