Reviewing blocks

You said Id also like to ask you that in future for the sake of fairness and due process that you do not decline the unblock requests of users you block yourself unless the request is pure nonsense or abusive From an ethical reviews of blocks are meant to be carried out by a 3rd party

Will do  I thought it was pretty clear in this case given the editors user page GNAA etc etc etc that the unblock request was pure nonsense  Also I was under the impression that the unblock request would still be visible and reviewed by other admins  Ill be more careful in the future
