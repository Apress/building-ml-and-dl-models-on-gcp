Look i went on the bbc sport website and they said something about carlos tevez and qpr now as soon as i added his name to QPR squad it was instantly deleted i was disgusted at how this ignorant user unedited what i had put as a constructive purpose without even resaerching to see if it was true the showed horrible arrogance by thinking they knew it all i had to keep putting the correct thing up every time then this Mattythewhittey was being rude and threatened to block me because he was to impatient to check if my sources were true Please unblock my account i was only trying to add constructive facts
