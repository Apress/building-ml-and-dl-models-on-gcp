I have been using JavaScript JS to fix the RAW  Raw problems and now that you tell me I realize it has been doing that with the refs However I do not believe its that big of a deal to go back and fix all the ones Ive changed Anyway Ill take Orton vs Benoit JBL vs Taker Guerrero vs Angle and Cena vs Booker if thats cool with you AX
