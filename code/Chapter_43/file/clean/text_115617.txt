Recent edit of Discriminant of an algebraic number field 

Having completely rewritten that article a while back I was unhappy with your edit summary  I put a lot of effort into a careful selection of content and presentation and citation and I even asked for feedback before replacing the page with my new version and it just seems like your summary is insulting my efforts Am I wrong Your edit while appreciated certainly didnt warrant your comment and Im not sure any of your corrections are related to the math MOS specifically
