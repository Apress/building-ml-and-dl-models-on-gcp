Wounded at Sandy Hook 
Im a newbie at Talk pages Im curious about why you reverted by insertion of a reference to the two wounded victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in the opening paragraph Since the title includes the word shooting but not murders I felt the wounded were being ignored I could not find a relevant discussion at the Talk page Could you point me to it or explain your thinking   
 Hi  I certainly dont recall doing that  Are you sure it was me  Perhaps you have me confused with another editor  Let me know  Thanks
