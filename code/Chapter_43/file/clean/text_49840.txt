Well I will be seeking mediation soon and userUtherSRG too seems to think it is a good idea  Ive been busy this past week and will remain so through Tuesday of next week so Ive been using this talk page in a lowkey way as and when I can find the time to collect information for the eventual mediation  If you can wait until Wednesday we can then discuss how to pitch the Request for Mediation  MedCab might ask us to do an RfC and we could then discuss where to do it on the other hand they might go straight for a mediation and we could then discuss how wide to cast our net in terms of speciesgenerafamilies  Let me know what you think of this  Regards Talk
