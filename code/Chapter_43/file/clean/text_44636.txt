This is how I would propose to lay out material on a subclass of semirings in this case complete star semirings  Firstly define complete semirings and star semirings each with a set of examples  Finally define complete star semirings again with a set of examples   In this case continuous semirings are closely related to complete semirings so it makes sense to include them an additional motivation here is that this emphasises the relationship between partial orders defined on the semirings and the star structure for example Conway uses the order approach to prove Kleenes theorem in his 1971 book  Of course there are choices here  For example should the examples of complete star semirings be introduced early on or only after the last definition  Theres no right answer to that  I would like to see examples of a concept which are not examples of the richer structure folloewd by examples of the richer structure  Examples of continuous semirings would have been helpful but as some editors have said there is no deadline  In my view a definition without an example is hugely preferable to no definition at all the reader in search of information will still be able to see what sort of thing it is and find references to further resources on the subject  That it seems to me is what an encyclopaedia is for
The current state of the material seems to me to be intended to do one thing only which is to introduce complete star semirings in a way which makes the star operation as close as possible to the traditional Kleene star  This is not the only approach  A reason for the axiomatisation and separation out of the various properties is the entirely reasonable mathematical activity of finding out which of the properties of the Kleene star derive from what assumptions  On the way various structures of interest emerge and various theorems are proved about the relationships between them  That may not suit the point of view that star semirings are really or completely unsurprisingly the original formal languages but thats only a point of view it isnt correct or at least isnt the whole truth and it isnt helpful to the reader of the encyclopaedia
