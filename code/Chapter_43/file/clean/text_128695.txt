VandalProof 12 Now Available
 
After a lenghty but muchneeded Wikibreak Im happy to announce that version 12 of VandalProof is now available for download Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs like the persistent crash on startup that many have experienced version 12 also offers a wide variety of new features including a stubsorter a global user whitelist and blacklist navigational controls and greater customization You can find a full list of the new features here While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last its nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof Thanks to  I now have an account on testwikipediaorg with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof which I plan to make available in the near future An example of one such SysOp tool that Im working on incorporating is my  tool which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another Anyway if you havent already Id encourage you to download and install version 12 and take it out for a testdrive As always your suggestions for improvement are always appreciated and I hope that you will find this new version useful Happy editing
