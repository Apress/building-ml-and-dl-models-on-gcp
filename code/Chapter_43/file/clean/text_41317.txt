As reviewing administrator I  deleted the article not necessarily because of no indication of importance but because it was a purely promotional cv

A Wikipedia article needs to show notability with references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources print or online but not blogs or press releases or material derived from press releases   
It also needs to be written like an encyclopedia article not a press release list everything a person does write in paragraph format about the key points of the education and career 

Be aware you will need to write the articles to Wikipedia  style a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles   

First give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date degrees previous positions If there are published books list them in formal bibliographic style List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly getting citation figures from Web of Science Include major national level offices and awards but not minor ones Be sure to list editorships but not mere editorial board membership we consider it very important and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also with a link to the bio  

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV  For any part you quote directly from a published bio include quotation marks and a reference

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites which are usually more expansive

As a general rule a suitable page will be best written by someone without Conflict of Interest its not impossible to do it properly with a conflict of interest   but its relatively more difficult you are automatically thinking in terms of what the subject wishes to communicate to the public but an uninvolved person will think in terms of what the public might wish to know If you think you can do it right according to our guidelines do so but expect the article to be carefully checked for objectivity
