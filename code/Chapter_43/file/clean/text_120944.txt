Your question to Mongo 

Its perfectly normal to delete the talk page of a deleted page And as for the protection well its hard to believe that thats a genuine question from someone who innocently and genuinely is wondering and has no intent to harass and annoy another user Ill give you a little piece of advice it you want to avoid being blocked for disruption and harassment If someone deletes something from his own talk page assume that he has read it and do NOT  attempt to repost it If you are sufficiently familiar with Wikipedia to be able to check logs and know who deleted or protected a particular page then you are also have sufficient knowledge to be able to work out for yourself why the page you refer to was deleted and protected whether or not you agree with the decision
