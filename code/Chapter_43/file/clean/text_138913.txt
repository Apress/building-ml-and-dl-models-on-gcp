STO is not airing Browns games

How do I know this

They returned an email I sent them straight up asking them if they were carrying the games this year

Took awhile for them to get back to me but they did fair being fair they have more important things to do than answer an email from some goofball Wikipedia editor

Sometimes you just gotta go straight to the source
