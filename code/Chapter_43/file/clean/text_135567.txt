Pakistan and Irak centrifuges 

There is some interesting information on centrifuge types in an 15 years old Atomic Scientist article 

The article mentions
 UltraCentrifuge Nederland UCN
 CNOR machines 2 separative work units
 SNOR 5 separative work units
 Urenco consortium
 G1 centrifuge between 2 and 3 separative work units per year
 G2 5 to 6 separative work units
It is believed that most of Pakistans centrifuges are based on the G2 design
