TalkList of Baháís 

Please see comments I dont see why the whole article has to be so radically trashed I understand the idea of sourcing and have been working on and off for months putting citations on individual pages I think the whole matter of sourcing on lists is at least confusing and to eviscerate pages seems darn disheartening after a lot of work to try an improve thingsnot that I havent taken time away  as your own page says sometimes Wikipedia takes a lot of our time
