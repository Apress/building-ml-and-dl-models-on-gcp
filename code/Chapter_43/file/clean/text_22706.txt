I think shortening the American Civil War article would make it worse 
The subject matter makes it difficult if not impossible for the article to be adequate in covering the major topics if it was shorter due to the nature of the subject matter There are already a lot of subarticles on the Civil War Also every attempt was made to be concise and leave out filler to begin with I dont know what you could take out that would be an improvement as opposed to the opposite
