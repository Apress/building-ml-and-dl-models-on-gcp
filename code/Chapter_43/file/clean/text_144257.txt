Since I see nobody is unblocking me let me be clear about this

I was fixing templates Thats what I would still be doing if not this block I called  lazy And refered him to WikipediaDick Even though at least one admin has expressed his opinion that he disagrees with me by blocking me I still think this was completely true and correct Even though  seems to take offense to this I think that this is just another expression of his being a WikipediaDick I wouldnt have made a point out of this though if not that he kept warning me I was actually busy fixing templates Frankly I hope hell be a happy WikipediaDick now and leave me to my WikipediaWikignoming
