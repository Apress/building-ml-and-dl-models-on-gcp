Firstly neither you nor anyone knows what people think of the subject of this article  Best known for his highly public descent into madness I would say  You say something different  All of them are points of view  From the use of the word perhaps you can see what a vague and meaningless claim is is anyway  NPOV is a core policy so this opinion must be removed  And secondly using his own promotional blurb to describe what you think he is best known for is not neutral either  19016252196
