Russian scare in Pacific if late 1800s 

Hi there you might be interested in creating this article In the 1880s  1890s Australian colonies  New Zealand armed themselves against what what later called the Russian scares  fears of Russia controlling their sealanes and even invading My personal theory is that this fear was built up by British arms suppliers rather than any political facts but you seem in a position to write a balanced article if youre interested  we dont hear much from the Russian point of view on this regards Rod
