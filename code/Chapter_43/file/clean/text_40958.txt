Help with Sulfates category 

Hello I dont know if you are the appropriate person to help with this but I ask anyway Plase take a look to the sulfates category it shows a lot of fluorides compounds that do not belong to that category The problem is that none of the fluoride articles indicates that it belongs to the sulfate categories in other words there are no links within those articles as fas as I can see to the sulfate category Neither there is any link in the sulfate category page to any of those fluorides How can we fix that is it a bug in Wikipedia Sorry but Im still not familiar with categories
Best regards I appreciate your help
