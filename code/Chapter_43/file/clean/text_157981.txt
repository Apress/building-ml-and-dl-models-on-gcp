Tropical cyclones left out of the database 

I was wondering can you show me any systems that look suspect Ive looked at pictures of the September 121992 storm and I believe that it was a hurricane John Hope said something about it when it happened The CHC mentions two possible storms in the 2002 season that brushed Newfoundland There was one also in 1996 that looked as though it was a full bird TS that passed off of Newfoundland as well  Shearwater912
