Bigfoot

Welcome back Like the Devil and Daniel Webster True the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species but is tentative and unproven But the search goes on for evidence The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers with or without PhDs to speculate that there may be aPlan C where the beings may be neither hoax too many sighitngs for that nor zoological no body but instead may be a theoretical spacetime creature This has not yet been stated It needs to be Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti But there is something else This is being ignored and swept under the rug Always remember that with no official funding mainstream science has no positive opinion on the topic and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs and one paid nonacademic

Now we the Six on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley will edit and re edit and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers We will NOT
go away Editors would be welladvised to work with our suggestions since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book They except one or two do not kow squat on the topic and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire Most it seems 
are also uneducated Daniel welcome back
