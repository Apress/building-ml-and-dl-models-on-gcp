 Watermarks 

I shall remove the obvious ones the less obvious ones stay I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to even if its a contradiction and if you wish me to use up further WP  bandwidth by reuploading them that has no effect on me I cant do anything until this evening and if any get deleted I shall reupload them Yours without respect talkemail 
You could have the grace to reply I said that Id deal with them this evening but only the ones where the watermark is visible from the page So  off talkemail 
I am planning to reupload them with less obtrusive watermarks such as that on ImageBliss parodyjpg talkemail 
It wasnt vandalism I used an external link as per your instructions which incidentally Im not bound to follow I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation as you are disrupting my life never mind WP to make a point I will tell you one more time any images are better than none If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images youre damn welcome to try but they are GFDL therefore theres no grounds for removal talkemail 
PS  I shall add the external link again not as an image and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation and the Information Commissioner in London talkemail 

 your conduct is a little off in this matter While Im all for discussing the issues with users lets keep it civil please Thanks  talk 

 I disagree Rob  it is far more than a little off Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia This is an encyclop√¶dia not a pet image project If TheDoctor10 isnt happy to play ball he can go elsewhere

I am proposing a change to the image use policy to forbid watermarked images Please voice an opinion at Wikipedia_talkImage_use_policyUsercreated_images Thanks  talk 

I edit from the United Kingdom and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act the editing of information online is illegal without permission The button at the top of every page that says Edit this page among other things constitutes that permission while the policies and guidelines form conditions Since there is no condition against my image it has a legal right to be there QED talkemail 
True but therefore your addition fails under the same logic Also Wikimedia own the servers its their right to delete it 13ID540053 
Apologies to Ed for invading his talk page but what a load of rubbish Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images regardless of whether they meet any policy I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission that implies that editing with permission is legal and nothing more Furthermore by your logic I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia and remove your images I fail to see what on earth you intend to tell your lawyer but I dont imagine the Wikimedia board are too concerned talk
