When I was placing some important publications in Turkish Wikipedia many other editors supported and encouraged me to put more and provide the complete list of publications Some of them even said that the articles were developing in the right direction ask me to make more research to complete the entire set of publications I spent more than two weeks to find these publications from various other data bases since I know that Wait  Barut were two important scientists in their fields They have more than 300 journal pubs and I have selected some important ones When I gradually placed these publications the editors were happy they approved the material and ask for more All of a sudden the preparer of the singers football players came out and erased all of them Hey Whats going on there whats happening Then this person also erased the material on EnglishWiki which was approved by your editors Now have you understood the whole story
