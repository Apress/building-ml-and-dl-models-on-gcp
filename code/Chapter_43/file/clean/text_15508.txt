About   

I already emailed this report on  I hope that someone of serious Wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the Wikipedia dignity

Hello

I do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia  but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editorsI noticed that you have a person whose nick name is httpenwikipediaorgwikiUserSpylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 511 hours dayly This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and hisher edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people

The best way to describe hisher behaviour and contributions are given by a few people which can be summarisedquoted this way

I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others contributions due to what I call factual correctness  instead of knowing the facts and reporting them

Ive noticed that you are editing someones contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections  not reading references at all Moreover not reading the references nor providing your own  you are demanding new references

Also on January 12th youve made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hoursmerge clean copy revert etc Dont you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day hours and hours  practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia only irritating many people this way

When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here was reduced by UserSpylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the citation needed tag  Moreover UserSpylab completed his own editorial work by adding unreferenceddateNovember 2006 and weasel tags on the top of this page How a serious editor could tagmark his own edits this way I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction Ultimately the existing edits cannot be rewritten or destroyed by just throwing claim replaced content with info from NeoNazism in Croatia because old version didnt focus on neoNazism as he did

All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations  failed Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously UserSpylab started throwing accusations last edit brok 3RR rule you may be blocked  sockpuppetry etc and selfpraising UserSpylab work as superior and claiming that I do not know what NeoNazism is My attempt questions to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already  are removed from the talk page and when Ive put back the deleted questions  UserSpylab ignored them completely

I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here Then I went further and examined the whole UserSpylab editorial work and noticed that UserSpylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days ie more than fifty edits per day  November 28  December 7 2006 In that period of time UserSpylab was busy by the Wikipedia editing on November 29  9 hours November 30  16 hours 63 edits  December 1  18 hours December 2  7 hours December 3  8 hours December 4  21 hours December 5  12 hours December 6  17 hours and December 7  8 hours

The content of UserSpylab edits were  spelling check version reverts removal of links copypaste etc So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person

I just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like UserSpylab As per hisher own words as an NeoNazism in Croatia section editor Spylab publicly claims

Actually its not complicated at all The revert war has nothing to do with point of view and I am not an expert on Croatia at all

My note  how then this person should edit some subject she is not familirar with Also all references written in Croatian and given here in the NeoNazism in Croatia were removed As per Spylab question here
