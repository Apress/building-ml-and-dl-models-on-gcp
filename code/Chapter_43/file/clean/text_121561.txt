The wouldbe analogy is labored book evaluations dont start to resemble astronomical theories I look at the article on Arudou and see a link to one favorable review of the book What kind of majority is this Whats meant by demonstrating a source This is a book on a subject of particular interest to perhaps unjustly a rather small number of people and published by a perhaps unjustly obscure publisher Amazoncojp bills it as オンデマンド版 and gives it a sales ranking of 1507918 amazoncom doesnt give it a sales rating at all It would be most surprising if it were to get more reviews than can be counted on the fingers of one hand Still educate me where is this majority Googling brings little sign of the existence of other reviews
