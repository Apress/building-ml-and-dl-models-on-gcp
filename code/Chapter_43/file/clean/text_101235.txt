On what source says SLT are natives and they has heritages before 1215 like in SLT page  No sources but still a great page Why is that 
 I dont know about which section historypolitical reasons you are talking about
 I know the context clearly About history Parakramabahu_I_of_Polonnaruwa 1153 to 1186 who considered as greatest king in Sri Lanka sent military campaigns in India and in Myanmar But he didnt find any significant separate Tamil power near Jaffna Same story goes with Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwaruled 10551110 the greatest warrior king in SL history Two greatest warrior kings in Sri Lanka never found such a Tamil settlements in Jaffna before 12th century but now people have found a big invisible settlements
 Sri Lanka is multiethnic country Others should think why all the ethnic groups  Muslims Burgers Indian Tamils lives withing Sinhalese and non of them live with SLT in northern province
 If you think only me backing this page who are these people
