I think that the infobox should at least have a picture of Muhammad if there is to be one anywhere  The image for the page on Muhammad should be a depiction of Muhammad  Having calligraphy or symbolism replace an actual picture would not be in the spirit of wikipedia  Regrettably it will offend some people but that is not nor should be the impetus behind any decision  A picture of Muhammad would be more encyclopedic and offer more knowledge therefore it is the only real option if this is to remain a truly neutral place to obtain knowledge  Also I feel like there is an overabundance of images in this article  Lots of images of redundant or mildly irrelevant things as if people are unconsciously putting in different images because they feel bad about putting in an image of Muhammad
