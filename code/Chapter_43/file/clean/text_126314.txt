Venue suggestion needed for a meetup in Yuen Long


Dear   

In the past meetups we always had our meeting in the centre of Kowloon either Kowloon Tong or Mong Kok However apart from these places I am sure that alternative venues in other region would be suitable

This is the time for your suggestion According to some discussion on Chinese Wikipedia from August of 2007 the Hong Kong Wikimedians meetup would be held in all districts of Hong Kong in a circulation basis

Here is the tentative information of the first meetup
 Date11 August 2007 Saturday 
 TimeAfter 500pm
 Proposed regionYuen Long

The community would request for ideas of where we should hold the meetup  in order to have a better decision If you have any good ideas dont hesitate to give your opinions million thanks

Regards
Hong Kong Wikimedian
