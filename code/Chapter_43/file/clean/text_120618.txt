Beating around the bush 

having just arrived at this article i found it incredibly hard to discern what it was that appropriate technology entailed i feel that this article could go a very long way to include a simple single sentence summary of what appropriate technology actually is The following line from httplsacoloradoeduessencetextsappropriatehtm was far more useful to me than the existing background and i suggest that someone find a means to incorporate it or something similarly to the point into the beginning of the article I would do it myself however as an unregistered user i do not have the confidence to go about editing the article

Appropriate technology is smallscale technology It is simple enough that people can manage it directly and on a local level Appropriate technology makes use of skills and technology that are available in a local community to supply basic human needs such as gas and electricity water food and waste disposal
