Comment  I would assume that the 201314 UEFA Champions League is one competition with various stages where as the 201314 ALeague is a separate competition to the Final Series of that season the league acting as qualification for the endofseason playoff tournament So it could be said the 201314 ALeague season is comprised of two separate competitions
