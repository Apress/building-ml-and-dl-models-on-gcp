Edits by Keraunos

Hi Keraunos I see you added to and rearranged some of this article I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them

 You added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource But actually that isnt physically accurate The universal heat diverging to infinity doesnt provide usable energy Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear ie the universes Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle called Mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained Hence I went ahead and cut this edit of yours

If people read further into the body of the article under the section Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory some of this is already explained with references provided for further research with a number of the references available online for free

 You added a bit into here the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infiniteduration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature

I kept the ressurection link I understand from reading your user page that youre into science fiction and transhumanism but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology as well as computer terminology which isnt that accurate such as avatar The term preceding your edits simulated reality already expresses the ideas youre getting at and people can follow that hyperlinked text if theyre not sure what that means

 You added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion which according to Tipler will occur between 5 X 1016 and 5 X 1018 years from now in proper time

One should be more accurate in their terminology as most people think of Artificial Intelligence AI as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality then the programs of their minds would be natural but on an artificial substrate Hence Im changing this to From that point on the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these mind children as it approaches the point of maximum expansion with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term

I also removed your quote of Tiplers estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately which is what that estimation is based on So Tiplers current estimation is different now For more on that see

 You added the section Criticism from string theory

I kept pretty much all of this while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting I changed the section title to Implications from string theory since Brian Greene doesnt actually offer any criticism of or even refer to Tiplers Omega Point Theory in Greenes book that you referenced

This section as it stands now might have to go entirely as it appears to fall under Wikipedias rule concerning original research As its written its a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true but its an original deduction

 You moved the See also section to underneath the references You also added a number of links therein

Based upon Wikipedias Featured articles it appears that the preferred location of the See also section is where it was previously before the references Hence I moved it back I removed the link metaverse because its a science fiction term thats perfectly explainable with more acce
