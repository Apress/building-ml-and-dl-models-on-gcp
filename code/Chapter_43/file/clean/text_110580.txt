Student encyclopedia 
Hello again I am the Alexandria Agriculture college student who asked about making wikipedialike websites in the previous archive I have talked to our colleges chief minister and he agreed with the idea I was wondering if you are interested in helping us starting it The reason i am asking you is that you have already done that before with ClueNet and we would be very grateful to get some help Thanks in advance
