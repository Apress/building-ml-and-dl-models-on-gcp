Sorry for the delay and yes Id love to talk sometime Im currently in thesis writing mode under the the title of Securing Wiki Platforms Against Damaging Contributions so novel research has taken a back seat for several months while I aggregate previous work Im glad to see that youre getting experience across the project and Id even like to pick your brain about research relevant problems Ive analyzed vandalism and detected vandalism Analyzed spam and detected spam Analyzed deletedcopyrighted content  and  then I come to find your proposal about Turnitin which would seem to complete my trifecta I cannot express how interested I would be in collaborating with you on that and contributing whatever resources I have If you dont mind perhaps Skypetext or IRC would be preferable so there is a record Look forward to hearing from you Thanks
