I dont think that the way to deal with a perceived NPOV problem is to delete a whole bunch of factual material which can be verified by consulting contemporary press reports and other sources  Lipinskis decision to turn pro and the statements and actions of her agent and family were all highly controversial at the time  Wikipedias usual policy for dealing with such controversies is to report the facts and to cover both sides of the dispute equally not to pretend that no controversy exists  In other words whitewashing the story to only give the side that presents Lipinski in a favorable or sympathetic way is not NPOV either
