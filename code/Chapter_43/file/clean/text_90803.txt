Quick Change 

I made a quick change Christopher Arp of Psyopus auditioned in this guitarist search as he later said in an interview with Terrorizer magazine and Eddie Van Halen auditioned for fun due to him being friends with the band I did this because it is unnecessary information that has nothing to do with Limp Bizkit directly or anything else in the article  It was not cited and all effort to find a source were unsuccessful
