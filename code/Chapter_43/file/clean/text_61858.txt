I dont want to get off on the wrong foot here  youll understand if I am a little skeptical given the lack of information on this fellow and the fact that a high percentage of the websites which give him such credit are antiDarwin sites Priority disputes on Wikipedia science pages are quite common theres on on the Albert Einstein page as well at the moment and what is required in all cases is to make sure that it can be demonstrated that Wikipedia is reflective of significantly notable points of view and not fringe points of view This is not to say that there arent ways for nonmainstream points of view to be incorporated into articles and is certainly not meant to imply the correctness of one view over another So if I am suspicious just take it into context that in most cases I am used to people trying to push little agendas when they insert priority dispute information like this into articles and it is nothing personal against you Thanks
