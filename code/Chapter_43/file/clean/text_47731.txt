early 2004 before or after brendons joining and interviews that say the band was formed in 2005 may be in refernce to when they were signed and became a real band rather than a basic garage band Either way Ryan wasnt necessarily lying and a more fitting title may be a good idea

 Emo 

This band has emo lyrics that should be stated somewhere in the article I would add it myself but Im probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan 

PunkPop
Punk Revival
Emo

Are SUGGESTED STYLES from allguidecom

The term emo is thrown around so loosly and its become a label that bands and other people see to be offended by I dont think that its necessary to state that in the article especially since emo has no real definition in the first place

 Former Band Members Section 

Do any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for Former Members and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not I dont like the fact that its just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal 

 Wikiproject proposal 

Ive proposed a Panic at the Disco Wikiproject here to see how many people would be interested before starting one The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic at the Disco pages including members of the band songs and albums If you think that youd be reguarly editing these pages please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project Thanks in advance   talk   

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with itryan ross

emo

Wouldnt things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic being emo Emo is basically this generations grunge Sure the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam No not really So just because Panic and say My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesnt mean they cant be the same genre And guess what just because emo bands hate being called that doesnt mean anything Grunge bands hated being called grunge too 

And there definetly IS an emo sound Theres definetly a particular vocal style lyrical style and attitude that emo bands have

Agreed Panic is an emo band but many fans here seem to have a problem with that 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo I think its just because the stereotypical emo isnt really something that a lot of people want to be associated with I agree that the vocal style especially is emo and the way they look is also associated with emo not all songs but some songs of theirs have emoish lyrics too Im fine with the genre being changed its just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended instead of discussing it here its going to be changed back a lot However on the page its set as emo and alternative rock which is perfect   talk   

 Early 2007 album 

It says their new album will be ready for compalation in early 2007 thats not true in Rolling Stone Ryan says He plans to write record the album during the summer of 2007 and release it during the fall of 2007 I would add it but ive never done anything like that before so I figured id just put it in here httpwwwrollingstonecomnewscoverstorypanic_at_the_disco_high_school_musicalsourcepanicatthedisco_rssfeed Thats the link to the rolling stone thing by the way

 Panic and FOB together 

       Ive been liking Fall Out Boy and Panic since last June I heard that PeteWentz and Brendon Eurie are switching roles if you know what I mean If the rumor is true it would be very nice to hear Pete sing for PATD and Brendon play bass for FOB
