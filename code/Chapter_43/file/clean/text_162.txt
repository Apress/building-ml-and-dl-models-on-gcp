 Reach outReach out is a program aimed at allowing users to bring issues that they have had in Wikipedia to a listening sympathetic and caring audience
 No one can know how we feel if we do not say We cannot expect to get understanding if we do not ask for it No one will dispute that sometimes lifes issues are too much for one person It is fair to say that sometimes Wikipedias problems fall under the same heading This is a place where you can bring the bruises that can sometimes be got on this project for attention Stress AlertsThe Stress alerts program aims at identifying users who are stressed alerting the community of thier stress and works in tandem with the Stressbusters at trying to identify causes of stress and eliminating them Note from the editorWelcome to this new format of the Esperanza Newsletter which came about during the last Advisory Council meeting  we hope you like it The major changes are that each month right after the Council meeting this will be sent out and will include two featured programs and a sum up of the meeting Also it will be signed by all of the Advisory Council members not just  Have an Esperanzial end of March everyone
