More discussion of changes 

Heres a few excerpts from the article that Id like to visit

1 Smiths earliest religious experiences which involved heavenly visions and visitations the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure were not uncommon where Smith lived and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smiths early visions and divinations but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed

There are a couple problems with the above  First whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly where Smith lived  Ill explain why I think thats important later  Second whether Joseph used the seer stones Urim and Thummim to locate buried treasure and whether such efforts were religious experiences to him they were not  To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim  Third whether the fashionably elite Protestant clergy whatever that means which probably needs changing were not impressed by the early visions and divinations and subsequently not surprised or alarmed  This claim should either a be removed for its lack of verifiability or b be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a firsthand witness

I honestly dont have a recommended alternative  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion  Just to recap

a Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Josephs residential area
b Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him
c i Whether the term fashionably elite is remotely relevant to the article
c ii Josephs own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least

2 the Burnedover district of western New York where Joseph Smith Jr was raised is facially inaccurate  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence

that campaign also took place in the Burnedover district of western New York where Joseph Smith Jr had lived for four years

3 Nevertheless Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies  A rather strong claim  and I dont mind keeping it in but it should be on the following conditions
1 earliest be quantified to a given year and Christian quanitified to a sect of the time
2 We add the following text from Hugh Nibleys The World and the Prophets which tells of a time when current generallyaccepted Christian beliefs were heresies
Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians There are some Christbetrayers They introduce God as being unknown And to the Smyrnaens he says Do ye therefore mark those who preach other doctrines how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known page 55
The great crime of the heretics in general according to the Apostolic Constitutions is that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christbut is indescribable unutterable unnamable selfbegotten page 55

4 Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Youngs doctrine that Jesus was born into a spirit body like the rest of humanity and remained in that state until his Incarnation

The word incarnation doesnt fit the context of the sentence and Id prefer to discuss Mormonism here  I recommend we change that to say

The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was born into a spirit body like the rest of humanity and remained in that state until his mortal birth

5 He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject pondering and praying to God for an answer As Smiths teachings evolved his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit

I think the first sentence is out of place read it in context to see my meaning  Id like to clarify the second sentence it could be understood that Smiths teachings regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded  Id like to reword as follows

As Smiths teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches with each possessing a physical purified body being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost

As a side note the phrase especially in the region of the country where Mormo
