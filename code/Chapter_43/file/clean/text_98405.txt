Motto 

I was very surprised to see the motto on this page say Sonora is for hardcore Mexicans  Not only had I never heard that it sounded very wrong

httpwwwsonoragobmxBusquedaSitioIntegradaasp is the official Sonora state web site  Under the logo of Sonora it says vamos por soluciones  That sounds like a motto or lema to me  That means we go for solutions or we go by solutions  I know that motto on this wikipedia page is wrong and probably is a joke of some type  I dont feel qualified to take it down but the states logo and saying is what I just said I havent looked at all the information pages  but they are definitely not up to par with the pages on Mexico in Spanish  AmySterling
