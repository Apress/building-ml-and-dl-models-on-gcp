THERE IS STEVE URKEL TV SITCOM character Then there is Steve Erkel TV scriptwriter and director of educational films and reallife person
Steve Urkel as played by 15yearold Jaleel White on ABCs Family Matters is Americas bestknown nerd famous for his highhitched pants highpitched voice and pigsnort laugh
Steve Erkel as played by 42yearold Steve Erkel of Los Angeles is a regularlooking guy whose life has been complicated by Urkels success
In fact their homonymous relationship  no problem between consenting adults or fictitious teenagers  is no coincidence either Steve Urkel is named after Steve Erkel thanks to Michael Warren the shows executive producer Back in 1989 he borrowed his old friends name  without telling him At the time Steve Urkel was supposed to be a oneepisode character on a blind date with Laura Kellie Shanygne Williams I had never known anyone named Erkel until I met Steve says Warren Its an odd name but it sure clicked So did Jaleel Whites performance and Steve Urkel became a show stealing regular
Then as the voice of the Urkel was heard in the land Erkel began getting strange reactions People started looking at me twice he says Over the phone there would be these unusual delays during
transactions Finally in early 1990 a friend of mine called and said Theres this guy on TV with your name I watched and saw Michaels name on the credits and I said Ah hah 
Erkel gets latenight phone calls from pajamapartying teenagers who scream Steve I love you his girlfriend Susan Cook a psychologist sometimes introduces him as the other Steve Erkel and even his parents Lorraine and Roy Erkel who live in Sacramento find themselves having to explain the whole thing And says Erkel I have a second cousin in Wisconsin named Steve Erkel I hear that hes going through the same stuff
As for Warren he says he would never use a friends name for a character again Steves experience has put an end to that says Warren From now on I will get my names out of the phone book
Warren has invited Erkel to the set on several occasions and has introduced him to White Steve Erkel says the first words out of Steve Urkels mouth were Im sorry
