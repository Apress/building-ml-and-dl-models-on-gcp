The image Calvincycle4svg 

There seems to be an error in the Calvin Cycle image The image indicates that 3phosphoglicerate would be the product of the Calvin Cycle
However the article says that the product is  Glyceraldehyde 3phosphate G3P The sources I have found also tell the same
I am currently translating the picture into Finnish so I would like to know if and how it should be modified
