Temple Israel
Greetings Jayjg  Arguably Temple Israel isnt really a disambiguation page anymore at least not within the strictures of WPMOSDAB a topic on which Ive recently been lectured in stern terms by one of the DAB specialists I was considering deleting the POWdis template from this page  Since you have been involved in maintaining this page and since I have very much appreciated your efforts to develop and maintain good synagogue articles I wanted to ask your opinion on what you think would be best here Thanks very much
