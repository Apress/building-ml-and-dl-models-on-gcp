choosing to trust a partner who is physically at risk 

Back in February 2006 I believe you added the following item in the Human sexual behaviorSafety and ancillary issues section choosing to trust a partner who is physically at risk I started a topic on the talk page to help me understand what we mean by that perhaps leading to a clarification If you have a chance to contribute there and enlighten me Id much appreciate it Thanks
