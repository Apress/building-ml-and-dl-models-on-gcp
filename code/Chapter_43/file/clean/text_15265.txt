Reliable Source 

Im a high school teacher My students always ask me if they can use Wikipedia They seem stunned when I say they can and they often reply with an astonished But is not reliable  anyone can edit it I simply laugh them off and and share the countless studies that have shown Wikipedia to be in the high 90 reliable range

I am curious thoughwhat would you have teachers like myself say to students conducting research on Wikipedia concerning its reliability
