That was my point I wanted to rewrite the entire plot in a detailed dramatic and descriptive manner so we could trim it afterwards using precision and structure resulting in a concise summary that contained all notable details required to make a good plot The way it is now would be a great plot for a movie but since its for a video game I thought it would be best to start off powerful then work our way down to make it as concise as the plot seen for Arkham City The current plot is by no means the final plot theres still more trimming wikilinking rewording and copy editing to do Think about it in a readers perspective which of the two points youve made up there capture your attention more We still have work to do Im sure this will have a great result at the end
