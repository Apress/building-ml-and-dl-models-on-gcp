Gordon Atkinson
Hi thanks for your work on Atkinson Unfortunately the article had been riddled with vandalism the day before by a random IP As it wasnt picked up your valid corrections were mixed up with bogus nonsense I reverted the vandalism but as I dont know the subjects life and work I cant properly readd your work I suspect that your impulse to edit the page came from seeing the vandalism in the first place You could perhaps copy and paste your text back in with not so much difficulty as you know whats what Thanks and best wishes
