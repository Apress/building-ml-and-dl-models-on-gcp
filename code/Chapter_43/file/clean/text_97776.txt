 Question 

This is a bit beyond the policy proposal so I hope you do not mind my asking here  You have sparked my curiosity  What do the entries in my logs and user rights changes have to do with anything there  That is to ask how did you come to that conclusion  Best Mercury at 

 How can I mind I brought it up in the discussion I was checking your user rights log to see if you had been a checkuser forgetting that the CU flag doesnt seem to appear there when I saw that you seemed to have some problems with another Mercury along with a number of strange actions taken on your account a 5second block a sysopping after a voluntary resignation blocking yourself for vandalism an OTRS deletion etc I still dont understand what all that is about but it had made me suspect that youve been the target of vandals I thought it might explain why you seem so anxious to get this draft policy approved in such a hurry even though almost none of the people to be charged to execute it had commented I havent been back yet to see the current state I was trying to express my understanding toward someone I thought might have a personal need for the policy but in retrospect my comment sounds more like some vague insinuation For that I apologize  Â talk
