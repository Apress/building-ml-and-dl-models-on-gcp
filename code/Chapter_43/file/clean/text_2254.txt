Currently there appears to be nothing on Wikipedia about short term lending in Australia  New Zealand  This is a shame as short term Caveat Loans are a valuable tool for small busnesses who may need access to large sums of money in as little as 24 hours However not a lot is known about caveat loans despite it being a 500m business in Australia alone
