The Award does not seem to be credible 
The 1UP Award for worst game best name does not seem to come from a credible source at all The person who wrote the article even stated they didnt even play it They put it on the list because the name of the game made them think of something else until they found out what it was really about It has nothing to do with the quality of the game even though thats what the Award is basically stating I dont think it should be even included with this article
