You know what else I know being completely unacceptable to all perceived academical practice Blatant POVpushing being obstinately reintroduced without opposition

Since common reasoning with such a character infused with a classic case of cognitive dissonance is an impossibility I will address that person in any shape or form I deem effective and necessary He is not only an asshole he is an asshole a thousand times over

If one random person on the Internet can take academical precedence on a matter of Iranistics over an editorial board of acclaimed scholars of a specialist compendia who has approved of the referential value of the paper then it does nothing more than expose the ultimate flaw of Wikipedia that any idiot can edit the content in order to suit it to their own personal agendas and to boot castigate sources on extremely weak premises Now that is rude

So you know what being blocked from editing doesnt really mean shit to me Make it a permaban if you wish
