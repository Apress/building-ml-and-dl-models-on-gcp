Dylan Baker as Dr Curt Connors Daniel Gillies as John Jameson Bill Nunn as Joseph Robbie Robertson Ted Raimi Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant Tim DeZarn as Philip Watson Michael Papajohn as Carjacker and Bruce Campbell are all minor characters that I think are unnecessary to this list because for example the usher from Spiderman 2 is not a major character and appears for about 2 minutes in the film The carjacker appeared in a flashback that lasted at most 30 seconds I think the cast and character section should be limited to the main characters Feel free to add or remove from this list _
