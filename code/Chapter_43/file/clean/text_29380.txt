Merging the articles 
I personally think the Mega Drive and Genesis articles need to be consolidated Seeing as how they are functionally identicle to one another theres no reason why they need to be seperate The page could have a joint title Sega GenesisSega Megadrive and could simply explain thet Sega of Japan chose to call the system Mega Drive and their European counterpart chose to stick with the Mega Drive name Its simple and would prevent people from having to navigate two seperate pages As long as were voicing our opinions on the subject  I think the NESFamicom and Super NESSuper Famicom pages should be merged as well
