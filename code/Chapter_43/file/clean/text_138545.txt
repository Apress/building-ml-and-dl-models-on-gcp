edit conflictMy Dear though Furioso Orlando In the first diff  has left you a message about Masems talk  In my world a talk is a public lecture typically given at a conference convention or educational institution As you may recall I gave one of these at Southampton last month on a topic of mutual interest  In light of that and of Masems Signpost article I supposed that   referred to something of a similar nature that Masem had delivered Asking for the citation seemed that natural and polite thing to do It turns out Vordox meant Masems talk page Ive seldom seen that usage in Wikipedia or elsewhere  I see Vordox is active on Twitter where they have 129 tweets to their 3 followers and conversations with TotalBiscuit Masem CH Sommersand SargonOfAkkad  say hi for me

In the second diff I am attempting to address concisely a long long series of talk page contributions many of them of late by a single editor which argue for including additional marginal sources sympathetic to Gamergate  In this particular response I am pointing out that relaxed standards might have surprising effects and I use the name of the predominant editor as a metonym for the argument 

I might also mention that I myself have not complained  at least not publicly  of the numerous efforts that have been made to personalize the dispute on Gamergates behalf both onwiki and off including previous sections on this talk page elsewhere on Wikipedia and at 8chan and reddit and in press releases and correspondence  Ive simply reported them to appropriate parties
