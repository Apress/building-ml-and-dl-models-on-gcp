For the final time Maam I wish not to speak to you or have a conversation with you  If you can learn to speak the English language learn to spell American and not get me obviously confused with this Homer fellow then I would be happy to speak with you but until you can grow the slightest amount of maturity and learn some manners we havent anything to speak about  Good Day to you Maam
