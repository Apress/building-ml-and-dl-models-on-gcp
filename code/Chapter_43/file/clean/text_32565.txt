Dear Joel

I left some information and suggestions on both my usertalk and the village thingy on the site navigation about which I am clearly blind I really appreciate your advice I see you live in Sydney where I spent almost 20 of the most wonderful years of my life Im now in Oxford where I became an undergraduate in my 50s now doing parttime postgraduate cinema studies at the University of Exeter which has a strong film strand

Best wishes William
