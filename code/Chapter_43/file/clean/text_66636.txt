Removed languages 

If everyone starts pasting their language in the top of the article then the article will have names or headings and nothing else  There seems to be competition in placing their own language first or on the Top

If contributors are interested to speak about the article on their language let them contribute the full article in their own language in appropriate wiki and not in the one in ENGLISH
