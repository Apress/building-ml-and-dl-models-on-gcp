Hi Tom The problem was after an administrator not sure if it was you looked at the book listings and were happy they were neutral about two weeks later user  decided to sabotage the book descriptions and add on some totally irrelevant inaccurate and slanderous ad hominem attacks on the books author and he inserted them at the beginning of the book descriptions to try and discredit the content with a blatant ad hominem attack The ad hominem attacks were removed and then accusations by  were manufactured of having an edit war when he was the one to start trashing the page after it was approved  was also the one to start a destruction campaign against the separate page that the critical links and books were on before He appears to be very fundamentalist and not too concerned about using propaganda and slander to dissuade people from seeing any critical information His accusations beside being ad hominem were also completely incorrect Duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy or relevance or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on Wikepedia JWs usually refer to this trashing and slander as theocratic war strategy basically meaning anything goes including lies and slander if the end result is to promote the religion I have removed the ad hominem and I hope it will not return  is also problematic in the same regard as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda or insults above but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or JWs demonstrating his interesting double standards a sad but typical Watch Tower Society characteristic Hopefully it is settled now if Danny and Duffer can get over their very clear insecurities about their faith Posted Central 7 July 2005
