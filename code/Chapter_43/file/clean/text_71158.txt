You asked about my extremely limited knowledge of Hungarian Ive been there once a week in 1995 in Budapest and elsewhere and I play Hungarian music here Youre right its one of the more exotic languages here

By the way having been to a few places in the country I decided if I were to retire somewhere Id like to do it in Tihany That was my favorite spot of all the places we visited Just a little estate there with a vineyard and wine cellar
