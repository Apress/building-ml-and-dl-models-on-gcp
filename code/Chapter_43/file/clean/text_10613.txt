Please do not vandalise or delete my user talk page This is highly disrespectful You make many inaccurate statements in your comments Please restore my user talk page you deleted without permission I suggest you might want to have a read online about the sorts of behaviours that Wikipedia editors are being critised for Your deleting of another users page is probably one of the worst examples of Wikibullying and Wikiharassment ever seen At the very least you should have started a discussion before talking unilateral action
