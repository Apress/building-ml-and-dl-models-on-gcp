Thanks I appreciate your kind words Some of the ideas I have in mind are 
 adding information concerning online copies of journal papers lots of journals publish at least a part of their papers online for free  the system should inform the user that at this and that url there is probably a online copy 
 more or less automatic updating of the db according to the growing use of ref templates in WP articles
 extending this to multiple Wikis eg German French etc need multilanguage support but also separate wikilinks according to language etc
 extending this to other areas Physics Computer Sciences etc
 user management which will become necessary when the DB gets the attention of vandals etc
