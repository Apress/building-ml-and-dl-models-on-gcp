Aliases
I think it is a little silly to have the list of aliases in the info box None of these were aliases that Dylan used for long periods of time or that might actually cause any confusion No one is going to be astounded that Boo Wilbury is actually Bob Dylan I think the list should be moved to the article somewhere or dropped altogether
