Improving means contributing not just erasing  Erasure and blasting articles with issuetags is lazy work  So far despite a lot of talk here none of the people in this straw poll section have done any work to find differentbetter sources Dont like that hes called a philosopher  find an indisputable and preeminently reliable source that contradicts the sources that say he is a philosopher Dislike the fact that multiple sources call it the largest and most popular philosophy show  find a great source that contradicts that and add the controversy to the article Hell add something positive to say about the article subject if you come across new information I sure have added a lot of nonpositive items to this article for balance and because they are true and accurate things  Unfortunately this talk page is rapidly becoming an unsafe place for me to communicate because my comments keep being moved or deleted If you have an issue with any content in the article that Ive added drop me a message I will do the hard work  research to fix the issue as best I can
