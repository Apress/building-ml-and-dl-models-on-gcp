UserVarsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin  That makes him more Polish than Chopin If Sawoniuk isnt Polish neither is Chopin I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this  if he isnt Polish neither is Chopin Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuks father was a nationality other than Polish Sawoniuk is purely Polish This is crazy he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopins name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk  I asked him to provide sources  and the reply was this  no sources provided and more comparisons between FChopin and Sawoniuk He also accused me that I am trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin I request you review if Varsovians conduct is not in violation of the standards expected in the EE area  

Im not looking at it here If you believe that an editors conduct warrants sanctions please make a request on WPAE which provides a transparent framework for the examination of such matters
