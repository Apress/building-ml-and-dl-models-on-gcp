I thought we had reached consensus in the above talk item that marvin was staying for sure  Im not sure what LMHAMMER was proposing with his last comment  
the pinball clubs go
pinballHQ as proceeds go to the Pinball Hall of Fame might be worthwhile to keep or be placed on the PHoF wiki page
IPDB stays as it is similar to IMDB links on movierelated pages
PinballNews will probably stay or at the very least be used as references for newsrelated items
PHoF should stay or at least be linked to the PHoF page properly
Links to Stern and Pat Lawlor stay being the last pin manufacturer and major pin designer company left
Simulators WILL be questioned by some  PinMAME being the one that people will be most vocal about keeping the others can go to DMOZ
Online communities can go
Other information can go
Hows that for a summary  Did I miss anything
