I reverted it back because I preferred the original version before Rod Balls edits  I asked if anyone else agreed with Rod Ball on this issue  having gotten no response I assumed that other people either didnt care or like me preferred the original  In addition I believe that Pjacobi already reverted these particular edits once

 So Ill ask again  does anybody agree with Rod Ball on this issue and actually prefer his version  I like it the way it is now  To make it less personal do people like httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleBell27s_spaceship_paradoxoldid79349924 or httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleBell27s_spaceship_paradoxoldid79587575

 I think that a family of paradoxes is more technically accurate if you reread the literature section youll see why Hillman the originator of this wording described them this way  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related again I borrowed this from Hillman though I added the wikilink to Born rigid motion  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related though not identical  Thats just what the intro says  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships in the final analysis  Its fundamentally about distance

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox originated by Dewan and Beran is named after Bell
