Duncharris has sent me more than one very insulting message to my userpage  He uses such words as fundie nonsense etc   Duncharris also admits I have been polite to him  You can go to his userpage and see for yourself 

MickWest and duncharris want to play Atheist bullyboys  by sending me repeated messages to my userpage designed to irritate me  

If you want to make a message to that kdbuffalo comment page saying I cite an abundance of medical historians medicalscience journals which is the truth it would be appreciated

Also I believe this policy is being ignored

None of this however is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views There is no size limit to Wikipedia But even on such pages though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth
