Genesis and the Hebrew Bible 

While it is certainly true that the Book of Genesis in the Christian Bible corresponds exactly to the book named Bereshit in the Hebrew Bible I think it is incorrect to say that the story of the Ark is contained in the Hebrew Bibles book of Genesis chapters 6 to 9  If you are going to reference the Hebrew Bible call it Bereshit but because that name is lesserknown I think it is better to say it is contained in the Christian Bibles book of Genesis or better still contained in the Bibles book of Genesis since it is in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible  Id change it myself but Id rather not have to fight down the objections so Im explaining it instead  Talk 

You make a good point Ill change it to the biblical book of Genesis
