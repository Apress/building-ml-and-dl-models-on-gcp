Improper Title of Obama in Photo Caption 

The caption on the photo of the living former presidents in the Oval office on January 7th 2009 lists Barack Obama as a president when in fact the photo is dated a full 13 days before Obamas inauguration and as such should list Obama as PresidentElect Obama
