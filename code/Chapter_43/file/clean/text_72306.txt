Potential Bids dead or alive 

As of July 2012 some potential bids on this article seem to be dead At this time serious candidates should be already engaged in preparing a bid have a website commitments at each political level making a budget hiring organizers But now some potential bids in the list look more like inconsequential announcements and do not show any sign of life since

  Romania nothing heard since 2007

  Poland nothing heard since 2010

  Finland no announcement only a suggestion made during the 2010 Winter Games

  Croatia the vision of a architectural studio in 2011

I suggest to delete them unless someone could confirm that they are preparing a bid during 2012
