Edit request from Shawnadaisley 1 July 2010 

Ive noticed that someone has edited the Britney Spears page and said that she has died on the 1st July 2010 in a car accident in LA Also I noticed that someone wrote right at the bottom of the page the very bottom that they have wrote Bye Bye Britney D This needs to be changed as soon as possible because this is a very offensive thing to write
