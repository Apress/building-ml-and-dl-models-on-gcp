Cryosurgery vs Cryotherapy 

What is the difference Cryosurgery vs Cryotherapy

WP has two separate articles similar content no clear explanation

Cryosurgery could be considered subcategory of more general concept of Cryotherapy

Or Cryosurgery could be considered to be destructive treatment Cryotherapy nondestructive treatment

But in practice the terms seem to be used rather interchangeably So Id propose that the articles be merged with inclusion of whatever can be properly said about any differences
