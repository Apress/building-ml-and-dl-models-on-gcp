Okie because of the size of this article certain sacrifices have to be made on sections that are large enough to support a child article and unfortunately one of these sacrifices is covering a single event within the subject area of the child article in detail  One of the ways to look at the presidential campaign section is to see it as the lead for the Barack Obama presidential campaign 2008 article If you look at it as a lead and follow WPLEAD then the campaign section as a whole should be 34 paragraphs long in total Is Wright controversy really worth a quarter of the paragraphs that we should have to cover the entire presidential campaign or is it acceptable to leave a 12 sentence summary of what happened on the main article and leave the actual details to the presidential campaign article  rants
