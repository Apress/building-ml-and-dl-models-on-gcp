No I will make sure that will be removed permanently  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations but hope that someone else will consider and agree  There is no reason whatsoever to put the late in front of his name I will list several reasons and although I think that is somewhat POV there are other reason as to why I remove the info
Everyone dies sometime  Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put the late in front of everyone that has died
Poor writing  Its just sloppyfiller writing to put the late in place  Would you ever see anyone referred to as the late in a print encyclopedia
Recentism  WP has a guidelinetemplate that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as the late  Lets make things as static as possible
Precedent  At one point several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as The late Steve Irwin now this is the only one that does by doing a search and there seems to be consensus about that
Knowledge of his death  Lets face it a vast majority of people especially those that would look for this article know he is dead and the few that may not be sure can click the link  Maybe people dont want to know that hes dead or be reminded of it and putting that acts as a spoiler  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few the lates put on pages of hers and those have all been removed a few by me a few by others Saving a click is not a valid reason for this we should assume that the readers are smart and things like that can go to the Simple English edition
Irrelevance  Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming

Well this is my case I would also like to point out WPOWN which I feel has been violated in these reverts  I also am starting a discussion on WPWords To Avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that I am doing the right thing  I am supremely confident that I am and I look forward to improving the PETA article in the future
