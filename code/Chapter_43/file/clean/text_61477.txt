As a result ingestion of excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate enough omega6 fatty acids is common 

What does that mean  

Does one require excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate omega6 fatty acids 

Or excluding the issue of ideal Omega 36 ratio is there a direct link between the intakeabsorption of saturated monounsaturated omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids and if so what is that link and is it desirable or undesirable 

I have reedited part as follows  which you may wish to consider

Triglycerides 

Excess saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids are unused and accumulate in the body in the form of triglycerides 

Reducing triglyceride levels  Options

1 Moderate the consumption of saturated and monounsaturated fats alcohol and carbohydrates
2 Aerobic exercise
3 Increasing the intake of omega 3 fatty acids fish and fish oil
4 Reduce the intake of omega 6 fatty acids
5 Niacin vitamin B3 megadose
6 Statins 
7 Fibrate drugs with reservation see following

Carbohydrates 

Carbohydrate consumption increases insulin production which in turn increases triglyceride production 4 According to the American Heart Association diets with carbohydrates constituting more than 60 of total caloric intake can increase triglyceride levels3 
Exercise and reduced carbohydrate consumption prevent insulin overproduction 

Omega 36 Ratio

Triglyceride levels are reduced by Omega3 fatty acids from fish flax seed oil or other sources The recommended intake is 3 gramsday in US and 2grams in Europe Ideally it should consumed in conjunction with Omega6 fatty acids  but with the latter at much lower levels than typically found in Western diets5
With the exception of Japan most westerners have an omega3 intake that is too low and an omega 6 intake which is much too high  the ratio being about 12 in France and up to 80 in caucasian US and Canadian populations

Fibrate Drugs

Whilst fibrate drugs reduce triglycerides substantially their side effects preclude their use as a first line treatment One such drug clofibrate has been withdrawn from the North American market because of the increased risk of mortality

Alcohol 

Alcohol abuse can cause elevated levels of triglycerides
