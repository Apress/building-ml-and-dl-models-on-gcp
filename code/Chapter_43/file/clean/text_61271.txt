Thanks Chaldean I have found some evidence that some manuscripts from the bishops library in Siirt did survive There are a few manuscripts in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France that seem to be survivors of the Siirt library 

The Assyrian tribes template could simply be made dormant delinked from articles with a note saying why thats been done until you feel that you can include more complete articles on the tribes The Nochiya Tribe article looks good Being a syriacist the only thing I noticed was that in the ethnic groups template the header says Nochiyayeh but the script underneath says Nochiya  you need an extra yud zlamipshuqi before the final alap I agree with you that it would be good to have an article about the geographic homeland of Assyrians However it would be have to be carefully and named You are right in suggesting the article Kurdistan as a good model as it has avoided all sorts of attacks by those who suggest that it infringes the sovereignty of other nations Also even though modern Assyrians celebrate descent from the ancient Assyrians we need to keep the articles seperate as they are talking about two very different historical periods Perhaps it would be good to have an article an article on Assyrian homeland that could be linked from the Assyria article in a dablink
