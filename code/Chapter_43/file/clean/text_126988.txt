This is why featured article isnt an ideal name for the distinction  Most readers assume that todays featured article is simply an article that weve decided to feature ie excerpt and link to on the main page that day  Without reading WikipediaFeatured articles the quality component is far from obvious 
Id propose a name change if I didnt believe that the nomenclature is too firmly steeped in tradition for such consensus to be reached  Sadly inertia is difficult to overcome around here
