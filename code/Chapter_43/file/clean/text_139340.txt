I wouldnt necessarily say theyre backing wiki This seem a popular sentiment Wikipedia has a history and has gone on record to note that their articles are not based on fact They are based on the most common belief Granted there are cases where facts and common belief is one and the same  its too bad Wikipedia does not stick to facts We sure could use an online wiki that does that  The fundamental reason why people feel something like wiki is useful is the quality of the summary NOT because someone said something once Quality summaries are written by people who know what theyre talking about vs random collections of heresay Its only a happy coincidence that there are more people who know what theyre talking about motivated to write about it than there are those who believe random collections of heresay is valuable and whatnot
