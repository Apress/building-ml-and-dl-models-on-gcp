Formal warning 

I just want to repeat and amplify what I said on TalkGabriel because I know its going to get drowned there Your behavior on the talk page and in the article is becoming increasingly disruptive obstructive and meets the criteria of WPIDHT quite handily So if you continue operating against consensus there I will be forced to request sanctions from administrators to preserve the integrity of this and other articles I and the other editors involved would appreciate it if you slow down take a few deep breaths and consider our opinions I would also make the friendly suggestion that you limit yourself to short sentences and paragraphs especially on the talk page all of us have limited time to devote to Wikipedia as a volunteer activity and our time is not well served by WPWalls of text that we have to comb through in order to find some meaning within Thank you very much for your consideration
