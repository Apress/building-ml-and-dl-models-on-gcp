Infobox photo 

Im switching the places of these two photos Siberian huskyjpg and Jessecohenjpg I feel that the first photo is a much better representation of the breed and therefore a better photo for the infobox On a slightly diferent topic can anyone get a photo of a husky standing I think that a standing photo would be the best way to show the sonformation of the breed
