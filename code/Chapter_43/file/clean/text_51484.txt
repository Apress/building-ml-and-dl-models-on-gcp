I mean the history of this article is getting ridiculous

People argue back and forth modifying the Mumia AbuJamal article
The part on the trial gets really big and is moved to its own page with only a summary left
New editors see the summary and add more of their POV to it
The summary gets expanded again



This could go on forever Im talking to you Steven Argue and Chainclaw Please respect the way Wikipedia works If you think the section doesnt deserve its own article then discuss that Dont just charge without discussing and recreate the whole section anew out of the summary
