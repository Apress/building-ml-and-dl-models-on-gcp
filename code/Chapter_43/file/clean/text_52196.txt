Hi Doug Weller I dont have the actual book but see the references in another book but I dont know hwy you say I got his name and book name wrong How exactly  Also you missed the point about it being from the 1960s as that actually BOLSTERS UP my point and what I said repeatedly longheld and longestablished explanation  And its in the very name of the section that I put on here if you noticelong established   So frankly given that Im exactly not sure why youre complaining about the half a century ago matter instead of seeing the arguable pro and point for that in what I was saying all along Its a longknown thing that ancient cultures sometimes hid things and embellished others   Also again how and where exactly did I get his name wrong  His name is JA Wilson and he did write a book according to what I have called World History of the Jewish People in 1964    So wheres the error exactly    Please let me know  Thanks
