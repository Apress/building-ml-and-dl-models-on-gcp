Harassment 
As I read the Wikipedia guidelines Harassment is regarded as far worse than any perceived COI To quote to make the target feel threatened or intimidated and the outcome may be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target to undermine them to frighten them or to discourage them from editing entirely  which is exactly how I feel 
  

 COI 
This is my statement
When I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance  as everyone does  I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients Seeing that one or two  Kevin Howarth Simon Rumley were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them I could have contributed to many other pages  and have  but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages He said how would I like to be an associate of the company  and  being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV  I said why not I then went on and edited Alan Jones and HayleyMarie Axe never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved I still do not think that any COI was involved since a I was never paid to do it b I was never requested to do it c I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyones career d Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby end of If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys  random topics of interest That does not constitute a COI

I am sorry but I do not see your point in removing my edit  Â Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

COI
whatever you think best I wouldnt mind but this policy seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product dont have some vested interests andor COI One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests I guess its one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations Thus was it always Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones 
Anyway I do not own the pages discussed so people can do whatever they like Im sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit   

Stange Behaviour By Editor McGeddon
I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLLs motives are I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo they are both me I couldnt remember my password for Zambo which is my maiden name so i made Moyo which is my married name This strange person McGeddon who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work I see he does this to everyone its probably because he has no power in the real world Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge He must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence Regards Thandi Moyo nee Zambo
