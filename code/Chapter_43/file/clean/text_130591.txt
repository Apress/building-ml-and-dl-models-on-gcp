Pearse version 

The sources chorus of the Pearse version is nonsense Óró sé do bheatha abhaile as the article tells you can be roughly translated Hurrah you are welcome home Why sé would suddenly be changed to be s é presumably a contraction of is é which would be copula itmale is a mystery to me I also take massive issue with the translation Even ignoring the fact that for absolutely no reason whatsoever it just leaves large passages untranslated some of it is just a clear sign of incompetence Fenians of Fál No Just no Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Irish language in a modern context will be able to tell you that Fianna Fáil means soldiers of destiny  fáil being the genitive of fál destiny and fianna the plural of fiann soldier much as in Amhrán na bhFiann the soldiers song and Lia Fáil the rock of destiny Its the name of a party for Gods sake and the article about that party also confirms it means soldiers of destiny Fianna Fáil The Fenians were a minor Republican group and Fál isnt even an English wordIm sorry but the sources  as Im sure other speakers of the language native or otherwise will be able to confirm  are just wrong Unless anyone has a legitimate reason to object Id like to correct the glaring spelling error in the original Irish and correct the stupidity of this translation Im sorry I really am but even Google Translate could do a better job than this Hailing Frequencies
