Are we going to start quoting single phrases from policies in isolation now For example I can argue that WPUNDUE also states in the very first sentence as far as possible without bias  Perhaps we can have a long debate about what as far as possible means next I can also point out that strive is closely synonymous with try which implies the possibility that one might fail under some circumstances yet more evidence of room for commonsense Additionally Ive already quoted from the template at the top of WPLEAD above Use common sense in applying it it will have occasional exceptions But all this will get us nowhere Demonstrate a way of assessing the relative importance of different aspects of the topic And more specifically demonstrate that the HIV issue is more important than any other aspect and deserves to be apportioned more of the lead than any other aspect because thats the state of affairs you are trying to defend
