re Wikipedia No personal attacks 

In my continued efforts to resolve the conflicts at WPNPA I have discussed another potential compromise version with the editors active on the policys talk page  That version located at WikipediaNo personal attacksProposal has been tentatively accepted by those editors currently involved in the discussion  However I would value your input as to whether this proposed policy satisfies your concerns

Obviously it is impossible for the policy page to be perfect  As has been noted in the talk page discussion there is no way to write a policy that will prevent editors  on either side of the debate  from taking extreme positions in regard to actual content or its removal  But as one of the principle editors rejecting the previous attempt to promote a compromise version I would like to hear from you before I consider contacting the protecting administrator regarding promotion of the proposed version
