Yes I agree The crash section is relevant as for time being Gripen has probably been the most reliable fighter aircraft in service the last 10 years But in the future as more planes might crash a list will be hard to keep track of and it will make the page look even more stange Can you imagine how a list of the F16s crasches would make its page look like As I said there is a reason why crasches is not listed Ok I will only edit the part about the swedish public thinking that Gripen is an embarrassment Its an authors POV about the publics POV not relevant Im a swede myself so I know its not even near the truth anyway
