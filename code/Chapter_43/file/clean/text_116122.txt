Evolution as a Religion 
1 Titanium Dragon  Quit deleting scientific discussion that differs from your view
2 Quit biting the newcomers as this page says
3 How can you archive something that was up for a matter of hours

I have presented several factual arguments and they were quashed almost instantaneously This is not your own personal website to cover up the truth

Evolution is not a fact And before you go deletehappy again answer any one of these points

You say this article references evolution as an observable natural process and as the valid explanation for the diversity of life on earth

Evolution has never been observed Ever Not one single transitory fossil out of hundreds of thousands found from hundred of millions of years ago not one has ever been found Ever Not one No proof

Fossils of mammals found tens of millions of year ago that look exactly like they do today Through continental shifts wild temperature changes mass extinctions floods asteroids they look exactly like they did from the beginning

200 million year old lobsters look like 2 year old lobsters

There is no mention that gas does not clump in a vacuum proving the big bang could not have happened using the very laws of physics that you hold so close

There is no mention that no one has ever observed a blue shift

There is no mention that its mathematically improbable for evolution to have occurred No mention that human DNA is so incredibly complex it could not just have come in to being through pure chance

There is no mention that not enough time has passed for cells to randomly have created the diverse life on earth

There is no explanation of the Cambrian Explosion  only 1 phylum before yet 13 afterward

Evolution is a religion
