Phasing out of bushels

The bushel article says Government policy in both the United States and the United Kingdom is to phase out units such as the bushel and replace them with the metric system What government policies exactly are being referred to Is bushel explicitly named in some piece of legislation as a unit that is being phased out What is the timetable for this I am thinking the statement might really just be an overly broad assessment of the situation and is just using bushel as an example but I want to be sure   7 July 2005 0633 UTC
