Since you clearly didnt bother to look Ill explain it in detail My response to Ken was in references to or interactions in the past in addition to this edit as well as this where he removed my comment stating incorrectly I removed a users comment which I clearly did not Then this edit where he reverted my reversion of his reversion Then a childish deletion of comments to his talk page because he was too much of a chicken shit to respond How is that for an explaination So basically he was being childish and I called him on it which made you mad So please look into the history of the discussion before responding to a discussion you clearly dont understand I dont have the time or desire anymore to discuss this with you
