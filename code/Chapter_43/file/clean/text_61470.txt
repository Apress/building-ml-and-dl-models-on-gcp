Your incorrect statements on my talk page Urartu TH 

As was decided by Penwhale on the AE page  Urartu TH talk  contribs blocked by Sandstein for WPNPAWPAGF issues separate from original request which was not actionable But on my talk page you had written To enforce an arbitration decision and for violations of the principles outlined in WPNPA WPAGF and WPASPERSIONS in your statement to WPAE This is clearly a contradiction and erroneous 

I would like to know if this was simply a mistake on your part or whether your decision was overruled In any case lets reiterate that I did not violate the Arbitration Decision regarding the Khojaly tragedy article at TalkKhojaly MassacreNumber_of_civilians_affected

I also would encourage you to take a closer look at the arbitration enforcement talk which is deemed not actionable  to see that I did in fact give evidence for Grandmasters behavior One need only read the DRN or the Khojaly tragedy talk page for examples and The second edit March 15 2014 was not even discussed in the DRN and I am truly perplexed as to how Grandmaster could attempt to enforce a DRNs conclusion on a topic that was not at all discussed 

If such evidence was not specific enough as to pinpoint my concerns then that should have been noted instead of simply claiming that I have no evidence I would appreciate it if you changed your statement on my talk page to reflect the actual decision of the AE action
