Lone boatman it is you who have willfully and repeatedly violated Wikipedias policies by making entire changes to the eternity clause article then threatening me as usual And you ask me now to stay cool as you continue to manipulate editors and possible administrators to cover your wrongdoings Oh I am staying cool You know full and well that I am staying cool If I was not cool I would have deleted your last changes It is you who made the last changes not me Hopefully administrators will see through your manipulations and make the right decisions Clearly you wanted a concensus and several other editors suddenly turned up for te first time What a coincidence You are not aiming at a concensus but are vandalizing sabotaging the eternity clause article

JanetteDoe You are right that the referenced article in National Review is about not changing the fundamental principles of democracy not a constitution And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman and the three other editors who suddenly showed up for the first timee and agreed with Lone boatman Lone boatman does not want the word democracy After I accused him of synthesizing he then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all international page in which he redefines eternity clause as a term used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph 3 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany This page was part of the German law page specific to Germany not an international one which is already covered under a Wikipedia article entitled entrenched clause Lone boatman added the additional international data at the top of the page only to cover up the eternity clause article And again he focused on the word constitution at the top of his change And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the entrenched clause to pursue his use of the word constitution which I had previously told him Germany does not have he then added Basic Law to his change to make it appear that he is not politically motivated with his changes Then several editors suddently showed up for the first time and one of them deleted the entire eternity clause article leaving only what Lone boatman had put in at the top Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article even a properly referenced article which the article was And it was not a personal essay on a statute as I have been accused of It is an important historic prohibition placed in the Germanys Basic Law regarding the protection of Germanys new democracy
