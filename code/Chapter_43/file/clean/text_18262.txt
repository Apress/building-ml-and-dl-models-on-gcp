I checked it out  Durova is clearly a proxy for Sanchez and has zero credibility as a Wiki admin  Same goes for Elonka though she operates via backchannels  Enabled by some of the usual suspects  JzG in particular  their actions confirm what many users have been saying for some time about the Sanchez article  Theres little use at playing a rigged game and thank god about 7500 other sites expose Sanchez for exactly what he is
