Negative Support for merger  Well logging covers many many more disciplines than electric line  Well logging covers mudlogging LWD DST etc surely you dont plan on merging those into well logging  Ideally well logging should look something like Well intervention where it gives brief snippets of different well logging methods and links over to them  I think the data in well logging should be merged into the other wikipedia entries  Finally electric line does not always produce a log  Perforating services and mechanical services like those used to set plugs packers and cement do not necessarily produce any well logs at all yet they are very important aspects of wireline operations  Entire wireline companies never produce electric line logs namely plug and abandonment companies
