No Caspian it is you and your mode of operation that is transparent

That is the big problem with dealing with Caspian  if anyone documents what THEY Caspian blue do eg create noise as a distraction they will turn around and use it in their next layer of attack attempting to draw attention away from them

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for Yonsei will also bring results for Yonsei University etc as a partial search results 

Using it properly eg search for Yonsei minus the word university  provides a far more accurate result for its usage 

Yonsei means yonsei Yonsei University is Yonsei University Neither the hospital nor journals were ever called Yonsei 

The whole debate has been bogus and poisoned and is just part of their Caspian blue persistent JapaneseKorean psychosis
