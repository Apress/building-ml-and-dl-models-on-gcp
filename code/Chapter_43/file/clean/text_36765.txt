Oh hey I wrote this in March 7th and both titles turned out to be correct In March 10th episode 17 title was revealed by English sources to be Tricksters Today April 2nd Zap2it listings revealed the title of episode 19 is Who is Harrison Wells The source I gave is the official channel who broadcasts The Flash in Latin America Warner Channel Titles are in English because the show is aired in English with subtitles in Spanish Warner Channel does not translate the episode titles of the shows they air  To LLArrow who said The source has already proven itself to be unreliable by stating incorrect airdates for episodes Airdates stated in the source are for Warner Channel in Latin America not for the CW because it is not a USA listings site But well this was a very reliable source and I really hope you start accepting nonEnglish sources next time    1750 2 April
