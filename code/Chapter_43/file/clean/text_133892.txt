I managed to cover part of the lens with mythumb in the excitement of them winning the award so this is a cropped version as I didnt think a smudge at the bottom of the photo would be what Wikipedia viewers would care for I do see what youre getting at but I dont think I would have wasted my time making screencaps to edit them so poorly I can edit the original Nadine picture to have NO black area at the bottom if you would prefer
