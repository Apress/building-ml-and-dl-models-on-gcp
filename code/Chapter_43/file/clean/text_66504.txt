Image copyright problem with ImageFlag of Nova Scotiasvg

Thank you for uploading ImageFlag of Nova Scotiasvg However it currently is missing information on its copyright status Wikipedia takes copyright very seriously It may be deleted soon unless we can determine the license and the source of the image If you know this information then you can add a copyright tag to the image description page

If you have any questions please feel free to ask them at the media copyright questions page Thanks again for your cooperation NOTE once you correct this please remove the tag from the images page
