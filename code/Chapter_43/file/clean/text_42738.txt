Actually quite a lot of religions start with multiple people being in on the jokescam Scientology Mormonism Islam etc  You would be extremely hard pressed to figure out if  when Discordia got real followers as its taken a very postmodern approach but Discordia has had a very significant influence on Wicca Neopaganism etc  Its just not a black  whie issue all it takes is for some people who really want to believe in a god to descide that Christianity sucks and FSM is better in some postmodernist sense
