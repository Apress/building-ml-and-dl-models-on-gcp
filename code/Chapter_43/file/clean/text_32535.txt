GA review 

After going through the article I feel that it meets the GA criteria and I have decided to pass it I have fixed up spelling errors and redirects as I read through it The only way I feel this article could be better was if it contained more current information on Psaltis and also if her ring name in the infobox should still be in boldface because bold should only be used if the person is still wrestling If she is perhaps include some information about that but if not then the name should not be in boldface Anyway congratulations to everyone who helped turn this into a good article    Shadow
