Earlier Experiments 

Many years ago I read a book covering this research and recently needed to recover some of the details  the problem is that they are missing and there is no mention of them in the article at all As I remember it the original experiments in water memory involved electromagnetic induction and it was only later experiments that involved homeopathic techniques It is the earlier experiments that interest me  mainly as I would like details on how to repeat them if they actually exist If they do exist they would be an important part of this article
