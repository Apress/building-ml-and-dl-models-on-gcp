I can say the furlong is a known length in the US and it even sees use on the interstate system as 18 mile increments are occasionally signed although I have never seen 18 mile think it was 38 ad 58 that I saw  Ive seen several old British signs that are still in place along roadsigns of public roads in the UK that a buddy of mine there showed me  Perhaps if he or the author consents I could put them up here  Think one was furlongs and there may or may not have been one that was in miles and eighths

Also does anyone have some information about the Myanmar furlong sign  Some internet armchair expert was claiming they were all kilometers now which I had assumed correct until seeing an even newer post less than 6 mos old talking about biking there and how everything was still in miles and furlongs there  If we had a more current picture of the signage there even if its the same damned toll plaza that would go a long way  Their government website at least in English is shall we say lacking
