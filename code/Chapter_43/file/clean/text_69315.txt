Actually Micaglia said that DALMATIAN and SLAVONIC and SERBIAN and BOSNIAN and CROATIAN etc were Illyrian and not JUST Croat Provide me you sources for the Dalmatians and Ragusans calling themself Croatians prior the 1800 I was unable to find them Ive provided proper sources for the Serbocroatian language that funny language that in Croatia cease to exist This story about the evil Italian claiming Dalmatia is a Croatian paranoia that does not need to be commented Trust in it if you like and start to plan the next ethnic cleaning for the glory of the great Croatian nation Regards
