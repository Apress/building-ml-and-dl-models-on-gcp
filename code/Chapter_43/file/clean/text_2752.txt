Official Christian Death   

This page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish which simply need changing and then leaving alone

I have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which I wish to place on here knowing full well that 5 minutes later the fools that wish to write things they know little about or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become CD will desperately alter the content  

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts  People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them  But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow  3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY

Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth Then Christian Death turned it upside down

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalistlyricist Rozz Williams the band released the first album Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982 A dark sinister style of punk rock The album gained local success A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band Pompeii 99 founded by singer guitarist song writer Valor
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99 the band had already released their fist album Look At Yourself to much acclaim which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon Thus began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic Catastrophe   Ballet
Like the first Pompeii 99 album Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death albumAsheswhich was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band Valor returned to vocals the band embarked on the 2nd tour In Italy the band recorded the mini album The Wind Kissed Pictures a surrealist view of a mystical past Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album Atrocities inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album The Scriptures the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today

1988 Brought us the release of Sex  Drugs  Jesus Christ This was turning point for the band The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity The band then found themselves confronted by protesters riots and bomb threats These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails Korn Marilyn Manson Type O Negative every Goth band on the planet and many others

1989 saw the release of the double album epic All the Love All the Hate interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death day and night man and woman black and white

In 1991 came the release of Insanus Ultio proditio Misericordiaque with its theme of an ancient dream state

Late in 91 after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris France Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash as explained to Valor
