Vandalizing the Macedonian towns 

Freestypefrappe I will not stay calm until you stop vandalizing the Kumanovo page talking only about murdering blood terrorism and nothing about the city normal life Of course there were moments in the Kumanovos history when a terrorist attacks took place but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesnt deserve such descriptions  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Pauls catedral Westminster Tower bridge and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground Talking about copyvios I noticed that you are using text written by Christopher Deliso  I found that on the following sites

Do you have permits for doing that
