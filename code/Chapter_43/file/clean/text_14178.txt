Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle the more you study the less you know When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia but as I study more about Croatia one by one facts that I knew before turn out to be dubious based on questionable sources or no sources at all Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later seveneenth and eigteenthcentury narrative histories These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not

Croats Sailed To New World Before Columbus And Vikings

Andrija Zeljko Lovric bases his theory on recent archeological finds of Islamic coins and Glagolitic writings in Paraguay
