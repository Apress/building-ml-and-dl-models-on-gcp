Not an attack just the facts 

Dear Sir
Please go to QRZCOM and look up AA4AN and you will see Tim Gaines Gaines is not his real last name His real last time is listed 

Not an attack sir just the facts Now please revert my listing As for not seeing QRZCOM doesnt allow for hotlinking to its database I had forgotten about that Further more here is link to an interview where Tim Gaines says he is a Amateur Radio Operator he gives his old call and when he moved he changed it If you go to QRZCOM and click on the detail tab you will see the history of his calls at the bottom I know these things because I am an amateur radio operator 

I know these things because I am also an Amateur Radio operator My call is K8CPA and you can look me up as well  

Many Thanks
