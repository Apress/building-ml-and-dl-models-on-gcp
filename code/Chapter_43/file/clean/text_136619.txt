Name NW First Truck sounds dubious 

What was this vehicle actually originally called I would expect the original name to be in German the language used in the area at the time and of the company name and this and and English translation should be given I do not believe it was NW First Truck apart from being the wrong language nothing is ever called first until the second one arrives I do not read Czech and cannot check the reference given There is strangely no version of this article in either Czech or in German  only Finnish
