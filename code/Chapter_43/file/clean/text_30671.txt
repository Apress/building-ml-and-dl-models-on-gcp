Concerning point 1 Milburn is a student by his own statement on his Wikipedia page studying philosophy in Lancaster What could possibly be insulting in saying that he is a student while I myself have been  not relevant I expect some respect from someone who could be my own child if not student 

 Concerning your point 2 please read my talk page and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn I have just stated facts Milburn has been writing to me that he is a dedicated and experienced editor Why should this have been relevant to me I had already told him in no uncertain terms that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon Yet Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor he was also experienced All these in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary I had just said that we ie I and Milburn disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster In point of fact University of Lancaster has one of the best if not the best laboratories of lawtemperature physics worldwide If there are ten great lowtemperature physicists in the world thee of them are in Lancaster they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator etc No you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster  some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there I even was their guest sometimes ago one of them also a mathematician of great international standing

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J Milburn as a person as well as about his contributions I simply do not know his and his contributions I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion That is why I suggested to him already yesterday that rather than arguing we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle That is all insofar as I am concerned It is J Milburn who has kept filling my talk page with his messages after messages telling me that I were wrong and that I did not understand certain things
