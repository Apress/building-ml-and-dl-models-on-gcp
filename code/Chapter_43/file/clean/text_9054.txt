Use of nee Dick
Kia ora  thanks for the tidy up on this article Im curious about the use of nee here  this is used to indicate the maiden name of a married woman any dictionary will give this definition and it doesnt seem the correct use of the word here as Moncrieff didnt change her name from Dick to Moncrieff on marriage and shes not currently married Is there a WP policy on this type of situation or a precedent for other women who have changed their names from their birth names to something else but not as a result of marriage Thanks
