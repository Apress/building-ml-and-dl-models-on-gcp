River Elan
I noticed your English language name variant to the Afon Elan article and was wondering  about the rationale behind the addition As an English person very long resident in Wales and one who has spent a long career in and on Rivers I am very used to the bifid naming of rivers in Wales The Elan however seems to be one that everybody calls the Afon Elan even Ordnance Survey cant find it in its heart to give it an alternative English name I was therefore intrigued whether a good ref existed for the English version  I am not going to get picky about it just curious  Regards    Velella Talk
