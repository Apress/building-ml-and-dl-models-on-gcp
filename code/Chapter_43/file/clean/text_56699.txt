Why was my Thrust1 edit reverted 

I removed CategoryThrust project as it didnt exist and moved the article from CategoryJet land speed record cars to CategoryJet cars as Thrust1 was not itself a land speed record car despite being constructed as part of the Thrust project to break the land speed record  Instead it was a lowspeed test vehicle built to allow the team to gain experience in driving a jetpropelled vehicle
