Hi We have three members already We all seem interested in the project I have created a template to place on articles talk pages An user from the Spanish WikiProject has just suggested that we translate articles from one Wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator but noone responded yet One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature I believe this was the first discussion of the project Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best I dont have a lot of time to dedicate to the project so I would like it if it didnt depend on me to survive and grow and be successful The other two members have asked what they can do for the project I would like to write something to better explain what a Wiki Project is for because this seems unclear I believe its not much of a big deal its just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place so if something important happens concerning that subject for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know It should also create a sense of community and its good to have that since well be editing the same articles I think things are going fine except that I dont know whether the other members see this as I do
