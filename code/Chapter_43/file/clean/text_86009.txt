populism as a positive term and a critique of critics

Since I wrote last fall several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18 Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance httpwwwwolpetrustorgzadialogue2007mangcupaperpdf  In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of populism that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7 2007 drawing on Gianna Pomatas scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of Enlightenment rationalism and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways  Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book To the Brink Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal 2008 sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see httpbookcozabookchattopicphpid2079
