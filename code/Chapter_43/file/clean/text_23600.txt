Hello thanks  Ived changed all refs to be of Citation style  I believe this article is ready to be added to the wiki  Please is it too much to ask that it be looked over before hand to chekc that it complies with wiki regulations  

There are two issues still of concern  1  References from 34 to the end are not listed in list of references even though they are in the text  2  Avraham has apparently barred me for abusive usage of my id  I have queried him on this have no answer and the barring still occasionally appears when I log in  In sum can you halp me with these last two matters and most importantly tell me if this is ready to go on wiki  Thanks very much
