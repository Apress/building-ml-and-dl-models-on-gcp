GA Sweeps Kept
As part of the WikiProject Good Articles were doing Sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria I went through the article and made various changes please look them over I believe the article currently meets the criteria and should remain listed as a Good Article Altogether the article is wellwritten and is still in great shape after its passing in 2007 Continue to improve the article making sure all new information is properly sourced and neutral If you have any questions let me know on my talk page and Ill get back to you as soon as I can I have updated the article history to reflect this review Happy editing  talk  contrib
