Ringerfan23  I just want you to let you know that you appear to alienate a lot of people on Wikipedia  Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group  In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance your actions were shameful  When faced with a group of people who reached consensus you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your poorly reasoned point of view  These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about  I think you should grow up recognize that your positions are often incorrect and defer to the democratic process  Seriously why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus
