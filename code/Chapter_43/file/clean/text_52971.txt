I actually have 2 pictures of him that I took upclose of him in the beginning of May of this year He wasnt in a great mood at the time because I think he was late for practice for the event and he wasnt signing any autographs I have his side shot of him getting his backpack out of his truck pretty close but its not a great shot of him wrestling or anything Ill happily release it for use on this page but Im sure there are better out there
