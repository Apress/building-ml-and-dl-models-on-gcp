If a photo shows that the post office is itself labelled UNITED STATES POST OFFICE on its exterior then I would concede would generally agree it could be renamed to that unless there is more weight of sources calling it something different  Pubdog andor BD2412 could you separate off those into one requested move discussion using the multimove requested move option

 Maybe some other concern here can be addressed simply  Specifically I dont see any problem with there being double redirects for existing articles  If theres a redirect to an existing individual post office article and the article is moved that does indeed set up a double redirect a redirect to a redirect to the article  But bots come by and fix those automatically within a day or so  Nothing needs to be done this is not an issue to worry about  If a name change is agreed to then just moving the article suffices  And then because of dab style rules the name shown in the dab page couldshould be updated to show the actual article name  The county NRHP listarticle need not be changed it can still show the NRHPofficial name and reach the article by a redirect perhaps temporarily by a double redirect but a bot will make it a single redirect very soon  Pubdog does that address your concern

 More complicated are cases where there is no article and the topic is listed as a redlink in this dab page plus in a NRHP countycitystate listarticle plus possibly also in a local town article  Then to implement a change requires finding and changing all of those to point directly to the new preferred name  You cant set up a redirect to a nonexistant article it will be deleted promptly  In these cases i would prefer for a stub NRHP article to be created immediately as that is easier and allows for verification that all the related pages link to the right article  BD2412 will you please agree that we can do that or comment otherwise rather than proceeding some other way in cases where a change of name for a nonexistent article is eventually agreed upon
