Request for Review

Hello  I am new to wikipedia and have been attempting to update the article Skyhook structure  Another editor BatteryIncluded a biologist BI insists that skyhooks and space tethers cannot be built with existing materials and sites articles that refer to space elevators which cannot be built with existing materials  I have attempted to educate and have supplied numerous references but to no effect other then BI deletes the references and reverts the article back to an earlier version that is grossly incorrect  I have left many messages on the Talk page for that article but have gotten no response there Another editor Huntster also nontechnical occasionally gets involved on the side of BI  Again no discussion of substance just reverts and deletes  I am writing you because your bio says you are a mechanical engineer and in the hope you would review the article and maybe bring a little sanity to the situation  Please post any comments or suggestion you might have on the Skyhook structure Talk page  I will update the article one more time for you but who knows how long it will stay there  Thank you for your time  7219914535
