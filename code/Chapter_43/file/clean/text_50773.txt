With Reference to Crossmr Issues 

Maybe Crossmr should not be removing large portions of discussion with no discussion Perhaps he should not be editing other peoples talk pages Improper irresponsible arrogant and just plain wrong Crossmr is guilty of this over many articles and it just plain insulting to other users I guess if you disagree with Crossmr your opinion  position  comments  discussion just dont count As long as Crossmr chooses to act like this users and clearly its more than just me I dont live in SF or Seattle will continue to abuse Crossmr as he does them Perhaps if he toned down his ego a bit people would have fewer problems with him
