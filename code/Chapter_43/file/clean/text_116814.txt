Hi Cool Cat I didnt delete for not being in English although the user who nominated did so for that reason using fairly unpleasant language I deleted for CSDR3 implausible typo It struck me as an odd situation nonEnglish language redirects that had no history and nothing linked to them with no details as to why on the talk pages After all its not something we commonly  or at all  do with redirects
But if there was a point Ill happily undelete but the reasoning needs to be added to the talk page Ill add it myself if you like But Id really like to know what it is o Cheers mate   
Id like to know who this individual is and what he said He isnt anyone I am tracking so I did not notice the articles speedy tagging As I created the redirect today I more than suspect stalking I have very few friends on wikipedia and quite a number of enemies mostly vandals such as UserMARMOT
The redirect for ああっ女神さまっ それぞれの翼 is the official title of the series The series is a japanese one and it is only logical for it to link to the respective article It is an alternative speling of the series
Situation is very simmilar to Allah The article in question explains the muslim deitygod and the name is of arabic origin The arabic script links to the page if I recall correctly
Sorry for the confortious initial attitide I am kinda under stress and loose my cool easily these days Yes its one of those times
