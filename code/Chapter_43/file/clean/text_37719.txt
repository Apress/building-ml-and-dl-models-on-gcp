All of which were and are true Bias from friends of the articles focus as the Chief Disemvowler of the Internet Hostile deletions I find this same thing goes on all over Wikipedia People lord over their edits and fight anyone who comes along with a change ouraged that anyone dare contest their judgment It amazes me how quickly the response to an insult gets top billing and the original infraction is swept under the cyber rug but this happens in the world often If blogs and forums can be used as sources after all this fuss then the battle of the last few months on this article was a bigger waste of time than it felt like Apparently the rules of content bend under group advocacy pressure Nothing new about that either
