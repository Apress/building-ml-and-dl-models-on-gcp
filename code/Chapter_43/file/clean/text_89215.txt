I removed the suspect paragraph
A little known early fact about Pasadena is the presence of a ships mascot in the form of a North American snapping turtle  The animal was kept by the crew during construction at Electric Boat and was even aboard during her launching into the Thames River  Immediately prior to commissioning the turtle named Frumpy was donated to California Polytechnic University in Pasadena CA
Pasadena was launched into the Thames because she was built at Electric Boat on the Thames That makes sense California Polytechnic University in Pasadena on the other hand makes no sense
