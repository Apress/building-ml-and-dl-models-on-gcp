Old sockpuppetry suspicion post that you never replied to 

Hello Last July you posted on my talk page saying that I was being suspected of sockpuppetry This was a surprise to me I asked you to clarify but you never did I just spent a while looking through the talk pages of the sockpuppeteer or whatever the term may be in question and it seems like it was decided that I was unrelated to the person in question and my case was closed WikipediaSockpuppet_investigationsMattisseArchive Id really appreciate it if you could post on my talk page something about this investigation having been resolved so people dont think Im some sort of evil malicious editor Id be glad to answer any questions Thanks
