What you just did is called censorship Censorship You do not like my opinion so you censored it I made no edits I simply expressed opinions I did not change anything I brought up logical statements for discussion Who are you anyway Who gave you the power to decide what is neutral I do not understand what your purpose is Haha who are you the Official the Authority the Almighty I have to discus with you how my statements are necessary and then you the Official decide How ironic are you aware you go against everything Wikipedia is about unregulated discussion
