Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes  

Here are some credible scholarly sources as requested for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianityrelated articles and other religious articles I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith the controversy around the issue and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some 

It says in the American Encyclopedia an academic accredited work 

The belief in the Oneness of God  as a theological movement  began at a very early stage in history and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades Christianity developed from Judaism and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God 

The path that led from Jerusalem the home of the first disciples of Christ to Nicea where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature can hardly be described as a straight path 

The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God Au contraire it is the opposite a deviation from that teaching Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God 27294 

Will Durant in his The Story of Civilization says 

When Christianity conquered Rome the new religion ie Christianity was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion the title of archbishop worship for the great mother and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child 

The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power 

Christianity did not put an end to idolatry rather it reinforced it The Greek mind came back to life in a new form in the doctrines and rituals of the church The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity the day of reckoning eternal reward and punishment and mans eternal life in one of the other From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child the mystical union with God the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism and the erasing of Christian doctrine And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years 

Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant which is something that he is known for and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret and he is not the only one who has researched them In his book Christianity and Idolatry Robertson states that Mithraism which is a religion of Persian origin flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE where it spread throughout the Roman lands Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities What concerns us here about this religion is that it says

The French Orientalist Leon Joteh is of the view that 

The origin of the Christian trinity is to be found in Greek philosophy specifically in the ideas of modern Platonism which took the basis of the idea of trinity as a view of the Creator of the universe from Plato then developed it to a great extent so that the res
