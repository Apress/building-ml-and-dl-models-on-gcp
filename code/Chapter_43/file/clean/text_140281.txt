RV in Lead section 

Dear Kathmandu2007

I notice that you reverted my moderation of the language of a paragraph on the royalty in the Lead section that in my opinion had a rather strong accusative tone I understand the feelings of the suffering people but facts can be conveyed equally effectively in a dignified and moderate way Please have a second look at it and do as you consider appropriate
Thanks and regards from a wellwisher of the subcontinent
