The main page of the article on UserThirteen squared could be improved if it included some information on the etymology of Nadya Sulemans last name   It happens to be very similar to the last name of another high profile individual not yet in the news as well as a high profile individual from 1945 over 50 years ago  And while I am on the subject I think I have a pretty good idea what Thirteen squareds real name is  All of these things taken together should be noted on the main page of this article
