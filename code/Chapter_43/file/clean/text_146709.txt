Just because you make a suggestion does not require me to accept it I thank you for the offer but I write as well as I can and your comments have saddened me much You have no recourse here because I am not doing anything wrong just because you dont think that I am writing unencyclopedically doesnt mean that I dont have a place here sir The article doesnt even have a copyedit rewrite wikify or even cleanup tag Allthough go right ahead and add one of you think it is neccisary I doubt youd want to discuss it beforehand I also think you have good faith but in wikipedia and not me I think you want me gone because I am stupid I am very upset and I am on the brink of tears did you know teachers used to call me stupid in gradeschool because of my disabilities I am quite certain that using such langauge is frowned upon in wikipedia Mr Unencyclopedic But you will not have your way nor deter me from participating in this project please be nicer and tone down your rhetoric Furthermore the article is better written due to your contributions and copyediting which i have not stopped that is simply untrue
