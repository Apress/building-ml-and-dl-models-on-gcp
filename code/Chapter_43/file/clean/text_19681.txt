This article is a joke 

It doesnt even mention Greedo the most famous changed scene in the entire franchise  It also doesnt mention Jabba the Hutt getting changed 3 times the ending of Return of the Jedi getting changed 4 times

I get it it said partial list in the first paragraph but these are likethe most glaring changes that were made to Star Wars
