Agreed  If you do want to do more research on the RfC it might be worth looking through his history to see how often he engages in revert wars that go right up to the edge of violating 3RR and stop  Ill be honest that I dont know how often he does it  If its occasional its not a problem but if its frequent then it might be worth adding the information to the RfC  And another thing Im wanting to compile data on is the abusive comments in edit summaries which as I understand policy are particularly poor form
