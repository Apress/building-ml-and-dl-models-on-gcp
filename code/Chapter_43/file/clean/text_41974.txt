No thats NOT my say Dont be assuming its only what I think Its whats reality Ive known this WAY before the whole iCarly thing Most editors use the DVD releases as the final say The Hannah Montana reference was to show you that they do list the episodes on DVD as to the airing order on TV as you said list episode pages by the airing order on DVD About the meet the Browns its pretty obvious that they only put 20 episodes on each DVD It makes sense as why they would only put 8 episodes into one DVD
