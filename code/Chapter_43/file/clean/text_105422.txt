Proposed move would benefit the wider community a copy in my talk page 

Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia therefore the content and title name of an article there necessarily needs to be encyclopedic not as in the case of dictionaries The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla However the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country But the name obviously misspelled there as the dictionary mentions rasgullƒÅ originates in Hindi  so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable Englishlanguage sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal then Bengal in British India The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal  a part of greater India not Hindi in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage  
 
Nevertheless here rises a question whether Wikipedia must stick to its current naming when the naming is misleading or inaccurate 

As per description of Wikipedia the naming the sweet should be seen as goals not as rules Whereas considering the deleted article Rosogollas naturalness consistency prevalence in many reliable Englishlanguage sources as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh West Bengal other states in India and world over the name Rosogolla has come into majority use The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla and describes oftenspelled Rasgulla it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US Some of these books are 1 Milk  Beyond the Dairy Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food by Harlan Walke Page 58 2 Strategic Management Formulation Implementation and Control by PEARCE Page 179 3 Food Culture in India by Colleen Taylor Sen There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogollas merit as a title name from the reliable Englishlanguage sources

Therefore my goal is to move the article Rasgulla to Rosogolla and the move would benefit a wider community
