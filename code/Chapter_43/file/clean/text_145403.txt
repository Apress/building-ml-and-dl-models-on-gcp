Oh is it a vote we are agreeing on or on the content  And where did I say that documnetries shouldnt include on filmographies If so I would blank the whole section YES Dont try to twist please All Im saying is this Documentry is not about Kapoor and she has no direct involvement towards this just only because being the reason she had been interviewed for it this shouldnt be included on the list I hope Im clear on my point Anyone please comment after watching the Documentry to say Im wrong with your point so we can end this topic
