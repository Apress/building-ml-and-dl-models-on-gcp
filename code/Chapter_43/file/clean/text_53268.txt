Filmbook difference 

The films depiction of the Entebbe Hijacking is different from the real event in the film nonIsraeli passengers are released while in reality only nonJews were released This is directly contradicted by the Operation Entebbe entry A total of 83 Israeli andor Jewish hostages remained Given that I imagine that is the more authoritative entry this should be removed from the films entry
