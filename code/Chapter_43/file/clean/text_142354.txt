To add more confusion to the issue I was a student living in the dorms during the 2000 census and we did have a census worker come by  She made it clear that we should fill the forms out as living in Columbia since we were going to school there ie living there at the time  She also told us to make sure our parents didnt claim us on their forms so as not to double count  For what its worth
