Im adding a cleanup tag on the article
Dates on Pinters website often tend to be dates of final composition andor dates of first performance and not dates of first publication andor dates of filmtv release  Several sections of his website were compiled by research assistants tasked with such work and by his multiple assistants beginning in around 2000 when the website was launched  There are sometimes typographical and other errors in the sections  Some works were published long after they were first written eg his novel The Dwarfs  When not confusing one tries to use those dates or clarifies discrepancies otherwise  Did some cleanup of this article  Added some citations and additional sources for verification and further reading
