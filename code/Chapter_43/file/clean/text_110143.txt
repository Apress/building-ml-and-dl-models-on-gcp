Rabbi Mordechi Eliyahu the past Chief Rabbi of Israel after his visit to the Rebbe said I saw that no secret is hidden from him and I mean that simply and explicitly He knows all of the Talmud Poskim legal precedents and in the Mystical works his understanding is very very deep He is the master of light He is a master of all the Torah And is an expert on everything that is happening in Israel His face shines like an angel of Gd and he himself is higher than any angel He is the greatest Torah master in our generation and no one is even close to him And together with this he worries for every Jew in the world
