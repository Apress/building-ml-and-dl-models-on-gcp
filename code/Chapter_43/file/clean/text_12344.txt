They all contained less info than the main article so they were merged into it The edits are still there in the page histories The one with the most info was S Drav but all that was was a list of populations a WPCONTENTFORK that could cause problems in synchronizing with the language articles There was no information on S Drav itself what makes it distinctive what defines it its history sound changes different scholars opinions on what constitutes it etc so it was essentially nothing more than a list and was not actually about S Drav The articles for the other branches were similar but had even less to them
