Im going to be harshere still No we should not remove it Stenger doesnt have to give a source TG continually confuses what editors have to do with what authors of source material have do do As for making stuff up see Psychological_projection  What we can see from the recent discussion on SU5 is not that Stenger was wrong but that either TG is a pathological liar or utterly incapable of reading technical material Usually I apply Hanlons Razor to these kinds of dilemmas but your track record here it too long and extensively documented to opt for the stupidity explanation for your actions Barr is absolutely the first paper to describe Flipped SU5 derived from SU5and his 1982 paper is repeatedly referenced for it as anyone would discover from even the most casual of Google searches   Similarly Stenger was absolutely correct about Derendingers 1984 paper  And Ive read the papers and your statements about them are to put it most charitably grossly misleading at best and less charitably absolute falsehoods There is nothing that I can think of that is more disruptive to or destructive of the aims of Wiki than the willingness of an editor like yourself to assert blatant falsehoods to try to push your POV on these articles And yet you persist month after month year after year in the most outrageous falshoods many of which were documented on COIN long before Will or I ever set eyes on this article apparently with the motive of protecting this article that you wrote and had another editor post at Wiki It is utterly unacceptable behavior and frankly inexplicable since your claims are so easily falsified by any neutral editor This has got to come to an end  Now
