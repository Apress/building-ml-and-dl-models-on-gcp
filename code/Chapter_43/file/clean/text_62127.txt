Interesting  Can this be added to both clarify the intentional blank entry and to demonstrate a feature of the grammar  In contrast slavic languages which also make a distinction between animate and inanimate but only for masculine nouns and have several declensions do in fact have a regular locative for animate nouns  eg volk wolf v volke in the wolf  On the other hand perhaps this becomes too detailed  I suspect that some people might find this to be inappropriately boring and detailed to the general wikipedia reader  Im only suggesting this though because the table looks  a bit bizarre with a blank entry and with no explanation
