I am a member of the Bot Approvals Group and I understand what Cyde is doing he has our support on WPCFDW he has been given approval for this there are no objections this bot has been operating for over five months doing this task I run a bot that does the EXACT same thing when ever I see WPCFDW backed up I also asked cyde to write the deletepy for such actions I have often come across large list of files that either per AfDCfDXfD have many pages together I find it a pain to manually delete each page that doesnt mean that I dont first check the pages  talk  contribs
