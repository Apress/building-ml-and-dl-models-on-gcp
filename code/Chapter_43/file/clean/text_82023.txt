The original Arab text refers to a Jihad against Zionists and Crusaders Most of the people of the world have a big problem with Zionists and Crusaders including me a Christian and most of my Jewish friends Up until 911 we assumed that our leaders of the United States followed a higher law than might makes right When the tragedy happened we thought that the law and civility the free world had established would prove to these backward people that there are superior methods of dealing with disputes than to hurt and kill each other

Instead our United States representatives proved bin Laden right They fell into every trap that he prophesied Bin laden was able to drain us of over two trillion dollars expose the atrocities that we had previously been able to hide from most of the world including our own people and draw us into a war that we cannot win There may not have been very many people actively fighting against the bigotry of Zionists and Crusaders a few years ago but the United States response to 911 has certainly opened our eyes since then I can assure you that large numbers of people from all ethnic and religious groups consider themselves part of the front against the war crimes being committed
