I agree that it doesnt have to be used every time but the edit eliminated all use of the word Dominion from the article I think that the use of the title Dominion of Canada to reflect the semiindependent federation of British territories that was Canada in 1885 just once is a good way to disambiguate the 18671931 use of Canada from say Canada as a colony in New France The Province of Canada of 18411867 or even our current setup
