Heather Mills talk page 

Hi would you please take a look at the Heather Mills talk page item 0445 14 March 2012 Ralphfcolucci talk  contribs   21892 bytes 2467   A Final Word I saw that you quite rightly removed and blocked an annon user on the Heather Mills article page for personal abuse 0137 12 March 2012 Edgar181 talk  contribs blocked 2490128161 talk anon only account creation blocked with an expiry time of 1 week Violations of the Biographies of living persons policy well I would suggest that this posting is roughly similar It insinuatesstates that Paul McCartney had to go to a VD doctor no refs and that he may have had to do the same there is little doubt that he was aware of Ms Millss special talents within 10 minutes of hopping into the sack with her etc It then goes on to a long rambling diatribe about abuse and male prostitution Apart from the unreferenced and malicious personal attacks about the subject I contend that the posting has nothing to do with the subject of the article at all and at the very least should be removed Under the Wiki rules about removing editors comments see WikipediaTalk page guidelines section 15 Editing comments Others comments I am loathe to do it myself and really dont want to get into an extended conversation with the person posting The comments are peculiar enough without adding to them
