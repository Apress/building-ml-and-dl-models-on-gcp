The ethnic Macedonians only have one autonym  Macedonian They dont want to piss off the Greeks The use of the term to refer to themselves and their language is not an attack on Greeks If it were they would use the autonym Greek not Macedonian And Aegean Macedonia is not necessarily an irredentist term It can be used as such but it is also used just to refer to Macedonia Greece You use the term Greek Macedonia which is considered offensive by ethnic Macedonians because it suggests that that area is Hellenic as opposed to only being under the controljurisdiction of the Greek government And then comes the dispute about whether Macedonia Greece is Hellenic or not 

Either way if you dont want to be labelled nationalist or dont want to offend either side I propose we use the terms Red team and Blue team to refer to the two groups of Macedonians  based on the  two flags using the Vergina sun Alex 202108928
