Im glad to be of help  I swear by wikEd for searching and replacing in the edit window  Its the best tool Ive found for that by far  Ill try your suggested workarounds above and will see about changing the wording of the bug report  By the way is there a way to turn off all the colorful highlighting  Sometimes I find it very useful but sometimes it boggles my eyes and blows my mind
