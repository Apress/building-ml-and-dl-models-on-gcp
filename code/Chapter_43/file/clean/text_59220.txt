Youre asking me to defend one part of the article thats erroneous and citing another part thats also erroneous  The Walther PPK came about AFTER the Sauer 38H the pistol on which the SIG P230 and P232 owe their parentage  In fact all of the above mentioned pistols owe their existence to two unmentioned pistols the FN 1910 and Little Tom pistols  They are both derivative and both developed in parallel
