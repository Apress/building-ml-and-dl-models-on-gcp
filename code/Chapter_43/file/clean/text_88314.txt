Your act of deleting the quote of Gligorof is just another act of fascism  counterfeit and propaganda  This is an encyclopedia so it must be accurateCan u explain me how is nationalist to refer to the words of an official representative of a state like Fyrom about its origins  Your acts show that u dont want wikipedia to be accurate and u just want to hide real factsYou push wikipedia into disripute and unreliability Its pity that u want to misinform the peopleGoebbels would be jealous with your propagandaThe quote had 3 references  one was also from wikipedia So learn to behave  we have democracy  not fascism The truth at the end will prevail The real truth not your corrupted truth
