re Intermediawiki linking 

re My talk First off please dont get mad at me for what I say below I say it in good faith and most likely a naive viewIt seems to me that youre going about interwikilinking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way Wouldnt something along the same style as the interlanguage wikipedia links ie in the bar on the left of the page be far better and much more elegant Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter Additionally there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links ie youd add one set of links on say Wikipedia and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites

I can see two issues with this 1 it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code 2 its not possible to use tracking categories Hopefully the first one of these shouldnt be too difficult to arrange and if interwikimediaing becomes popular I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal  or am I misunderstanding what youre doing The above works nicely if youre just linking similar templates together and even if youre making sure that they have similar functionality However if youre making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_ its not so good In this case a system like that used at HelpLink would be better  having a single master copy the best place I can see for this is on the meta which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often That copying could be done by a bot say every 24 hours with the template being flagged for human attention if its been modified anywhere but on meta Of course extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified  

Mike I be putting this whole section in WTTSP but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta and much of our good stuff is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well Omegatron CBD etc But here people know me and so this is where it began Like David RL called demanded and I went wikimissing much of last fall and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wikis then iterwikitmpgrp hit Tfd so that boot in the rear restarted things Id really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons Sigh life is not a selection of first choices most of the time were lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen  Ill address your points on WTTSP But thanks for the interest and input I like that idea of intersister interwikis As for What Im doing the WPTSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sisters though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries  ttfn  nkB
