Hi  I see you have recently created one or more new stub types As it states at WikipediaStub at the top of most stub categories and in many other places on Wikipedia it is recommended that new stub types are proposed prior to creation at WikipediaWikiProject Stub sortingProposals in order to check whether the new stub type is already covered by existing stub types whether it is named according to stub naming guidelines whether it is otherwise correctly formatted whether it reaches the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type and whether it crosses existing stub type hierarchies Your new stub type is currently listed at WPWSSD  please feel free to make any comments there as to any rationale for this stub type And please in future consider proposing new stub types first wha
