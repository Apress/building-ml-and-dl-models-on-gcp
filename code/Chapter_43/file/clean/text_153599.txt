Depeche Mode vandalism 

Hi John 

I noticed that you sought to bring a more balanced slant to the article particularly the recent albums section  However if you look into the edit history you will see that there are repeated RVs by what I call wikitrolls to reinstate unsubstantiated and negative commentary  I have taken pains to revert it back to your edit but they keep vandalizing the page  It may be the same person under different names but I cant tell  Is it possible for you to do something to halt their assaults on the page   Thanks
