This usage of serb as a religious term was used mostly only by Marko Miljanov Srpski narod meaning Orthodox people not nation it makes sense and considering he considered catholics latin and muslims turkish orthodox to him were serb now thats proof enough that he wasnt serbian ethnically so what if it is a forum source it does not degrade the value of the source
