Ian Jindal

Hi sorry for upsetting you by deleting Ian Jindal from the alumni of Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen  If you can provide a valid reference to Ian Jindals notability  I am afraid that his own website does not count other sourses could be BBC news online The south Wales Echo ect  I am not saying that Ian Jindal is not really who you say he is but anyone could add themselves without giving a proper reference I hope you can do this as I would like to see as many people as possible in the Rhydfelen alumni
