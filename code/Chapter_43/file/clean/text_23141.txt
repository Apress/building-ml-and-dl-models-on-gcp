I agree with Vast Majority Totally But that is still an evaluative statement The Vast Majority of people also see Hitler as a villian but does his page say Hitler was a villian
 I agree with you about people being protective of their children Im protective of my brother and my mentorees They know that I would do anything for them
 I agree with you that adultchild sex and sexual contact is likely to enrage almost anyone but the news tells a different story How often do you hear Jim Brown generic name was arrested today for allegedly having sex with one of the girls at his day camp and then they interview people who say things like but hes a really good person even if he did this I still see him as a hero or after a court conviction even hes always been a role model to the whole community he should be released or probationwhy send this nice man to prison I have heard things like that and it sickens me more than anything People are so fickle And clueless sometimes
 I agree with monitored But I also dont think a 20yo who was convicted of having sex with a 175yo yes this happened should be classified a toppriority sex offender for their whole life Kida ridiculous Now a 20yo with a 10yo Absolutely Let their monitor fall off after the heat of hell melts it
 I disagree that Wikipedia is soft on pedophiles In fact pedophiles are the only people not allowed to edit the encyclopedia that everyone can edit thats a simple fact I dont think we give anyone enormous sympathy and certainly you dont Do we treat them fairly and as legitimate people Yes Should we Absolutely All men are created equal right Remember we do not have Thought Police Hitler tried that I hate bringing that name back up apologies
 By the way though the very incarnation of evil Hitler was a masterful brilliant leader Most of the most notorious bad guys in history were Thats part of how they could accomplish so much and still be so evil Kinda sad when you think about it
