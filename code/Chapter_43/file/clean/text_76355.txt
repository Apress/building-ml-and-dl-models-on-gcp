Æµœš1 you state or pose as an interrogative So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing Ebonics as being defined as i or ii and specifically and overtly excluding iii  In reply sentence I say I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way  That way being from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective   I have said and I reiterate it here  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics   In other words Æµœš1 there are proponents of Ebonics and are antiproponents of Ebonics  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective   The antipropronents of Ebonics are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are proponents of Ebonics  That is they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective   I have said and and I reiterate here  the OUSD Boards December 18 1996 resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts OUSD resolution  The OUSD December 18 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home native or primary language as 1 Ebonics 2 Pan African Communication Behaviors andor 3 African Language Systems  I say Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie  

You state or pose as an interrogative Æµœš1 So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing Ebonics as being defined as i or ii and specifically and overtly excluding iii  In reply I say what I have said and I reiterate it here  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number iii is not Afrocentric at all  I have said and I reiterate here the view that Ebonics is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular EnglishAAVE is Eurocentric  I have said and I reiterate here the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics ie views  i ii and iv are Afrocentric  Given that I did in fact include view number iv as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number iv from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution   You should know that Im suspicious of your having ommited view number iv  For view number iv ie the view that Ebonics is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English and thus a rejection of the notion of African American Vernacular English but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution    

Now with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  could be interpreted as meaning that parents dont have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered  My reply is the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their childs or childerns home primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens home primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that if they believe their home primary or native language is English Non standard English Black English or African American Vecaular English ie the language slaves or dogs born in the masters house they can continue receiving the Special Education Speech Pathology a
