I dont mean to argue about it really but I just found it exceedingly strange and tried to propose a compromise that catered to both parties I do recall a part in The Secret Life    where a doctor put him so unlaughably high on the BP scale that he was very concerned and that would certainly be a sourced counterargument Ill look into it and see if it has merit If not Im sure that hell clarify it sometime in the future  0521
