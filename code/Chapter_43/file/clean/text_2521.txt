Hello I want to be able to upload images on Wikipedia and I am ready to do this now 

Listen up Wilko You sent me a message saying Im too new to add images fair enough Well I feel Im ready now to be able to upload images now If you read my user page you will probably notice that I am interested in the lower leagues of football and editing them Well I have been doing that but Ive noticed theres a number of less notable footballers who havent got images on their Wikipedia page Well I feel if I am able to upload images I could give these less notable footballers an image on their Wikipedia page So is there a chance you could grant me permission to be able to upload images on Wikipedia
