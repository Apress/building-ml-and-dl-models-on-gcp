Work in Comparisons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 

First Ill say thank you for helping me in the the article Ive been out of wikipedia and didnt had much time to work on Second despite the good points you added to the subject I fear what you added may not be accepted by the pronuclear side I can live with that it contain all info I need and for me its fine Unfortunately you cannot put 2 antinuclear studies in evidence and put all the rest in others section If you want the pronuclear people accept what you did you have to put at least 1 pronuclear study and 1 antinuclear study

Thanks you again for your help
