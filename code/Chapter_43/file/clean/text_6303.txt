Hi I just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub I think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs Also none of the information under Applications is cited If this section wasnt written by you and you havent found any evidence to support these statements then it might be necessary to rewrite this section Under references Reference List is misspelled Also it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section If you could incorporate more images to this topic that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory The analogies in The Hologram and Holonomy under Theory Overview was very helpful to understand the concept
