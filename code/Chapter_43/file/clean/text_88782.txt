Why should a company have to release a statement about a takeover anyway
On of the reasons would be to validate edits in informationrelated services such as wikipedia That iMesh is claimed to have purchased the Lphant P2P network is not related This article is about the client Besides from the fact there is no Lphant P2P network Finally if iMeshDiscordiaMerlin whomever hold the rights to the application they will soon request from major download sites for it to be replaced with their own client That will set the matter in wikipedia as well Until that happens acquisition of a domain name does not have any impact on this article

As for Bearshare I point you to a source from its Wikipedia article
