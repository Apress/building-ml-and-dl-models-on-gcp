No association between Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory and Bell Labs 

Earlier on this page  had enquired

Name origin
Wasnt the parent company and hence werent the labs named after Alexander Graham Bell  No mention of him can I find here Carrionluggage 

Today UserBilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled Early namesake in its entirety which chronicled the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory also known as the Volta Laboratory which AG Bell created after he won the Volta Prize The deleted section was titled Early namesake for the reason that there was an association by name as follows
 1876 AG Bell receives master phone patent becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company later renamed American Bell Telephone Company
 1880 AG Bell creates the Volta Laboratory aka the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory for research into sound recording and transmission including the photophone also
 1880 the management of American Bell created what would become ATT Long Lines AG Bell still owns shares in ABTC and hence thus is part owner of ATT  he remains Chief Electrician of ABTC and its children for several years
 1881 Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric
 1885  The long lines project was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company ATT
 1899  the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell  that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child
 1925 Bell Labs is created and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of ATTs engineering department

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or ATT Engineering and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection That there was a connection by name and share ownership as shown above is obvious therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article  Comments
