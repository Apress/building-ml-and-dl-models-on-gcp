If I were trying to post under an IP and a user name as a sock puppet why in Gods name would I IMMEDIATELY post after using the IP Whoops  sorry forgot to log in and identify myself  Isnt that specifically the effort of someone trying NOT to be considered a sock puppet which is why I did it  Based on the remarkable speed with which this block was begun and completed I assert that jossi and shem got together and said Lets work together and remove this person so that we dont have to hear his counterarguments  Clearly I was given absolutely no time to defend myself exactly 1 hour
