As it stands now the page is unintelligible to a reader not already familiar with the topic and it is worthwhile to completely rewrite it from scratch  It unnecessarily introduces confusing terms mesirat nefesh yehareg veal yaavor  Chillul Hashem Kiddush Hashem some of which are not explained at all  It confuses the term mesirat nefesh citing both a literal meaning dieing for the faith and a figurative one trying really hard  Also it misses many of the most important aspect of the law The biblical references Deut 65 Leviticus 2232 a person is not punishable for sins committed under duress even if it was still forbidden  I started rewriting it and found that the only way to present it was in context of Pikuach nefesh  This is the exception to the general rule if you dont explain the rule the exception makes no sense  After a few tries I gave up tring to rewrite and decided a redirect would make more sense
