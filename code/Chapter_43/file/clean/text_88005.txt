 A note concerning redlinks 

Many of the entries and their links are standard across all of the country outlines to aid readers especially young readers in comparing countries to each other

So if this country doesnt have any of a particular entry like navies please dont delete the entry  Instead complete it with none and a brief explanation as to why for example  x is a landlocked country with no ports  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location  See WikipediaRedirect WPSection linking and HelpSectionSection_linking

Standard redlinks article names were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible  So please do not remove those redlinks for they will turn blue eventually  In the meantime they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information if any  See WikipediaRedirect WPSection linking and HelpSectionSection_linking

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at UserThe TranshumanistOutline of knowledge

Your input and feedback is welcomed and encouragedThe Transhumanist    

 Please check and fix the government section 

The government section needs to be checked for accuracy  The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template and the data didnt fit all countries

So those sections need to be looked over and fixed if needed

Please help

Thank youThe Transhumanist
