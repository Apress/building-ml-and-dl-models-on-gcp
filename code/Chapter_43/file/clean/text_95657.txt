Thank you for your kind message  I hope you enjoy making a really positive contribution to Wikipedia  While I think youre broadly right in the Echo and Enterprise articles that the names should be Persian Gulf there are plenty of occasions where this might not be so clear cut  Bearing in mind that Wikipedia is a truly international encyclopaedia The English Channel is certainly right but then so again is The Channel a direct translation of La Manche the French name of the same waterway  Context is important but so is consensus  I cant recommend any form of edit war and its worth bearing in mind that consensus essential  If you lose your argument well there are over 3000000 articles in Wkipedia nearly every single one of which could use some form of improvement
