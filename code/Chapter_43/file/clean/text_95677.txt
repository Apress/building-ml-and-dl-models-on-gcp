You have now cited only one source albeit only in the edit summary  The New York Times Apparently however you are unaware of the close personal relationship between Lindbergh and the author of that papers stories Times aviation writer Lauren Deac Lyman which went back to 1927 when Lyman befriended a then unknown Lindbergh Lyman was the only member of the press whom Lindbergh told about his decision to go into self exile in Europe and he did so because he knew that Lyman would paint this actions in terms most favorable to his friend and with Lindbergh deliberately unavailable at sea for more than a week that this spin would initially be repeated by other papers that would pick up the NYT story from that papers news service This relationship and the tone of the resulting early accounts based on are addressed in detail in the cited TIME Magazine article on the issue of press coverage published on January 6th Since Colonel Lindbergh had offered no public explanation of his departure and radiograms sent to him on the American Importer were returned with the notation Addressee not aboard the Times story remained the scripture on which the weeks exegesis was built It was written by bespectacled Lauren D Deac Lyman who as the Times aviation editor befriended obscure young Aviator Lindbergh before his flight to Paris in 1927 Throughout the week Reporter Lyman stoutly refused to reveal the source of his scoop But Colonel Lindberghs hatred of certain sensational newspapers and his corresponding affection for the courteous Times have long been wellknown  In keeping with the Times policy of protecting Hero Lindberghs privacy Reporter Lyman weakened his otherwise firstrate scoop by failing to disclose the time and place of the Lindberghs sailing their ships name their exact destination As Lindberghs real intentions became known  his intention to live in exile in Europe  it then became clear that this was not just a vacation abroad but that Lindbergh had fled the country to protect them from danger that he felt that he and his family were being exposed to in the United States and that he would be living in Europe indefinitely

Aside from the Times you have again failed to provide any  citations or sources that support your claim that the number of sources which use the neutral left is huge compared with the single source for fleeing You also have also again misrepresented the number of sources that I have provided which is FOUR not one You have also claimed that I apparently believe that flight and sailed are the identical word to fleeing when I have made no such claim Sailed only describes the mode of transportation he used a ship nothing more The word I was emphasizing with sailed was furtively The term flight however is the noun that describes the event associated the adjective fleeing and verb fled
