V you make yourself ridiculous because this subject is so well documented Read about George White CIA MKULTRA ran San Fransisco clubs prior to the hippy movement which emerged from that town where patrons were spiked with LSD Ken Kesey learnt about LSD through his involvement in CIA MKULTRA experiments He was a core figure in the burgeoning hippy movement LSD did not leak into the youth culture merely from medical sources CIA had bought the majority of the worlds supply of LSD and this was a source and influence to the youth culture movement just as important as Tim Leary Even if you believe that the CIA kept its LSD well regulated the internal CIA culture is not seperate from the US general culture to the degree you would purport to support your skepticism The experiences that the CIA officers and experimental subjects were having with LSD is just as legitimate an influence on culture as any other individuals experiences Culture includes and intermixes influences from everyone CIA are not exempt as much as some would like to pretend they are We are all in this together this lifeboat earth this floating island in space And within the USA there cannot conceivably be the degree of cultural seperation between CIA and other individuals that you pretend
