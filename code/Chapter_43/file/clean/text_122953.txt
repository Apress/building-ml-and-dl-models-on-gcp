I note that people on here just got Wikid77 blocked for three months because he allegedly communicated behind closed doors called canvassing Why isnt rewriting a whole article just with a group of people who all agree with each other with no clear notice to the public what is going on or where this draft is located or how they can participate even worse This sure looks worse to me like some sort of Tag Team situation even if it isnt exactly canvassing I dont see why it is okay for a group to plan to remove a whole article behind closed doors while what he did is so egregious you wanted him blocked for three months In my opinion this attempted rewrite behind closed doors violates Wikipedia policy on openness That is all I am going to say for now at this level Have a nice day
