Azerbaijani manat 

thanks Ingrid for your question there is nothing wrong if you can see both Azerbaycan manati and manat that is Azerbaijani language is an agglutinative language all processes in our language goes by adding suffixes to the words thus when you say Manat of Azerbaijan you say Azerbaycan Manati that is that ı is a suffix which indicates that Manat in this case means that it belongs to the word Azerbaijan but the name of currency is Manat as the same you can say Turkmenistan Manati in oreder to indicate that the word manat in this case refers to Turkmensitan
it is a more complex Ill try to explain it by example
my manat  mənim manatım
your manatsing  sənin manatın
herhis manat  onun manatı
our manat bizim manatımız
your manatpl  sizin manatınız
their manat  onların manatları
that is you can meet many forms of manat with various suffexes but they do not change its meaning just relate that word with other words also you can see manata manatda manatdan and etc hope not bored you
