Where did 2752 come from 

I dont understand why the episodes of SAC 2nd Gig are numbered 27 to 52  While they are not clearly numbered 126 onscreen this is a seperate series not a continuation of Stand Alone Complex which is why it has a different name  Additionally the DVDs at least the editions released here in the UK list episodes as 126
