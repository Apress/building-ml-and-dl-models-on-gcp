I did a heavy rewrite on many of the trivia bits because almost all of them were copied verbatim from those on IMDb I hate when people do that I also removed a couple because they seemed too weak to be noteworthy I wanted to get rid of a couple others like the casting but thats just because I find that information boring but it maybe notable nontheless I also took a major slice out of the John Milton thing IMDb may not have original research issues but we do
