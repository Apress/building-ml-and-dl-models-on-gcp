Extremism  and The notion of extremism 

The reason for my recreation of the page under the different title and for the associated redirect is that it is at least highly if perhaps not extremely controversial to assert or imply or assume that there actually exists a phenomenon appropriately characterized as extremism 

I appreciate that I may not have chosen the best way of addressing this diffculty I would be grateful if you would advise me accordingly
