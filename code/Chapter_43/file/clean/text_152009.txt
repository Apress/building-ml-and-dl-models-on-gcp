UserMrs Gastrich 

I think its a little suspicious that this user claims to be s wife thus seemingly alleviating concerns of sockpuppetry by probably using the same IP address A problem is that  posted an RfA after merely 4 edits which is disconcerting 

However your post on the page that Mrs Gastrich was a sockpuppet of God and to refer to the Bible I found inappropriate I have since removed the offensive parts leaving only the statement of possible sockpuppetry I understand you may have passionate feelings about Gastrich and his involvement but please do not deliberately publish untruths
