Im afraid Im not much help here My knowledge here is that of an interested lay observer only With that caveat Ill answer your twopart question

First Im not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides not just based on the account of the exiles Given that the political climate has just recently improved Im sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written Now I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light No excuse for killing your own people and shutting down the education system for a decade Talk about a lost generation Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face

Second yes Ive heard some in the military wanted a Golkarstyle arrangement ie institutionalized role of the military in parliamentpolitics but Im not aware of a formal public proposal Im not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military Then again I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity I always thought she should have been more flexible She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done Not sure which National Assembly you mean AFAIK the military did an about face after the 1990 elections that the elections were not to convene the assembly but to write a new constitution HTH
