Hi notability isnt determined by popularity its generally speaking determined by significant coverage from reliable sources that are independent of the subject Films have other notability criteria which can be found at WPNOTFILM The deletion discussion which you were notified of on your talk page above is here There are no voices representing the keep the article stance If the director Paul T T Easter had been found notable there is a chance the film would have been found notable also However the Easter article has been deleted twice because none of the editors could establish notability on its fifth time around it was deleted as a result of a community discussion Hope that helps
