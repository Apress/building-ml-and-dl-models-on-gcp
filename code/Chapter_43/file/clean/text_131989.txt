There you go again Dr Hillman defaming Jack Sarfatti as a liar when you say he may be telling the truth Jack ALWAYS TELLS THE TRUTH to the best of his knowledge You do not For example you continue to say Jack taught at the University of London when repeatedly you were corrected that he was a Research Fellow there With you and others Jack is automatically guilty in your double standard
