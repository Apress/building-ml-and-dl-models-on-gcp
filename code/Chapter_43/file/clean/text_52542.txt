I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler For example the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas photographing objects as part of cataloging and exhibition installations and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly such as when the museums board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation Art Handling Collections Care Information Network PACCIN
