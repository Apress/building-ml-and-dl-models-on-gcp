If articles supporting Islam arent permitted those devoted to criticizing it shouldnt be either If an article can represent both views Views On Islam maybe thatd be something If the generic IslamIslamrelated articles do represent a positive image of Islam then theyre not NPOV and need to be corrected The tone was supposed to be neutral By the way I dont see the Islam article listing every positive comment or opinion ever voiced regarding Islam the way this article documents so many negative ones No Im fairly convinced this article shouldnt be here at all Because of the title only negative views regarding Islam can be documented followed perhaps by responses to those criticisms Pope John Paul IIs positive words on Islam or Muhammad wouldnt fit here nor would those of anyone else Muslim or NonMuslim whove ever expressed a positive view of Islam that wasnt a response to criticism That makes this article POVbiased at its core I dont particularly know Amin or Merzbow and Ill assume good faith until I know them better I do know several of the players who frequent pages dealing with Islam or Muslims and I know their intentions are malevolent Articles such as these serve as a platform for their Islambashing My suggestion perhaps it can be renamed such all views can be accomodated
