Well forgive me if I make any mistakes regarding the specifics of how editwarring is defined but Ill give you an honest effort

As far I can see Grundle2600 was the first editor to add this content to the article  This edit is fine as we assume good faith

Scjessey then reverted the edit  This is fine too as again we assume good faith  

After this point there should be no further reverts correct  Were supposed to discuss this on the talk page until consensus has been reached  Any further reverts is editwarring correct  

Well this content was reverted an additional 9 times

 Unitanode reverts
 HaeB reverts
 Grundle2600 reverts
 Nsaa reverts
 William M Connolley reverts
 Arzel reverts
 Tony Sidaway reverts
 Unitanode reverts
 ChrisO reverts

As far I understand the situation it appears that Unitanode HaeB Grundle2600 Nsaa William M Connolley Arzel Tony Sidaway Unitanode and ChrisO all engaged in editwarring  These editors are well aware that this article is on probation  They have no excuse as far as I can see  In fact many have already been warned and sanctioned for previous violations on this vary same article  By placing the article on protection you block everyone  Why not go after the editors who are actually causing the problem
