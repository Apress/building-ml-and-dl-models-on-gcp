Again saying that the logic ones using is racist is much different than calling a person themself a racist  I have been as clear as I possibly can about that so I will not apologize nor will I make any adjustments to my stances  If you feel personally offended then as Ive said thats for you to deal with  Ive said in no uncertain terms that Im here to get the truth out there and Im completely indifferent to what anyones personal feelings are about me  Therefore your threat of pulling rank means nothing to me I have done nothing outside of the standards of wikipedia although if any of my dealings with the wikipedia staff in the past are any indication I wouldnt exactly expect them to be objective either  But like I said do whatever you want  Im not gonna lose sleep over being put out of some online clubhouse if it were to come to that
