I think my userbox is nothing compared to the content of these users pages The counterpart to supporting resistance is supporting the agressor You should have sorted these pages out long ago with or without my userbox A proper offer would be that you sort every userbox supporting anything and I stop worrying about mine But still I saw how you people deal with things A consensus has been reached twice the second time with administraitor Viridae As soon as the userbox was back on my page another idiot removed it Viridae refused to restore it and remind the idiot that it was approved I guess that will be the case if we did reach another consensus
