Additions of team members and coaches of state championship teams
Hello I noticed you had added the names of team members of several state championship sports teams at North Scott High School to an article about the same While that is a very nice addition I have removed it because the athletes mentioned  while nice people Im sure  are simply not notable Thousands of high school athletes participate on state championship teams but never participate in collegiate or professional sports their only time in the spotlight is when they are on the trophy stand 

s advice is well stated You may want to review the notability guidelines for biographies and particularly the section on athletes and then consider whether their names are notable enough to include in Wikipedia articles Best wishes in your future posts
