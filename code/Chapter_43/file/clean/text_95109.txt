The Aztecs may indeed have worn dreadlocks  However the quote provided refers to only matted locks which certainly are not the same as dreads  A bad case of bedhead is not dreadlocks  Ive searched the Internet for Aztec dreadlocks and came up with zilch  Please please provide definitive information before reinserting this unsubstantiated and subwhat dubious information  Thanks
