Of course we can mention the view point here even using Press TV as a source but it should not be stated as a fact and consequently we cant have it in infobox if press TV is the only source   

 I think what genuinely matters more than verbatim use of the term is whether the source characterizes the movement as being one opposed to Imperialism which Wikipedia defines as a policy of extending a countrys power and influence through colonization use of military force or other means Having said that the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term antiImperialist verbatim to describe the Houthis Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the postcolonialist movements struggle against imperialists and colonialists Likewise the author in the linked paper from Taylor  Francis identifies the same antiimperialist themes in Hussein alHouthis thoughts Furthermore beyond these sources the very fact that Houthis antagonists are wellknown to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being antiImperialist in nature Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence namely US and Saudi as already mentioned in the article So I think it must be now obvious that the tag represents a definite fact and restoration is well due
