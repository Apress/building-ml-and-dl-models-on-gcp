Eh I hate marketing speak Isnt experience subjective anyway I dont see how perceived value thats generated from reading watching or otherwise experiencing some form of media can be objective In that case one may as well just use media Regardless can someone who knows the etymology of the word add a section on it In an Email conversation with Richard Stallman he suggested that it derived from the noun suffix used in nutrition fat content etc Im wondering whether content in this sense is actually an Americanism as in American plurals in this case contents often arbitrarily switch to singular abstract words content Of course I dont know which is why Im asking someone knowledgeable in the subject to write one    2052 21
