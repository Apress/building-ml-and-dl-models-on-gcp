Undergarment 

Thanks for your nice message  Ill consider it  but frankly  the cries of censorship are bullshit That is like the truthers who claim that 911 was a government coverup If that was really true  then they would be silenced as part of the coverup The picture is available in the linked article on Temple Garments there is no reason for it to be anywhere else  and quite frankly I dont care if I get blocked again  it just shows that Duke53 continues to own that section of the article and does not address any substantive issues raised regarding its use on that page
