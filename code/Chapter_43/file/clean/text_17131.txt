You raise a lot of interesting issues Ill give my thoughts on some of them First I think youre right that Eric is at least in some sense more readable Second youre right that we have article titles like Eric I of Norway and Eric VI of Sweden but also Eirik II of Norway so its not quite consistent I think that a high level of Anglicization is expected for the names of royalty where familiar names tend to be used if at all available If Eiríkr Hákonarson had ever called himself king I would be fine with having his article at Eric II of Norway But he wasnt quite royalty and he is a somewhat more obscure historical character than the kings so Im not quite sure how to apply this 

As for medieval usage I havent made a complete study but what Ive seen so far is that the Latin charters witnessed by Eiríkr during his life have Yric dux most commonly or Yrric dux or Iric dux The Encomium Emmae written in Latin in 1041 or 1042 has the form Eric and titles him as dux et princeps provintiae quae Nordwega dicitur

The AngloSaxon chronicle written in Old English of course has Irke a dative form or Yric or Yrice a dative form or Eiric Maybe I missed a variant

Old Norse texts are usually published in normalized orthography where the name is Eiríkr In diplomatic editions you will probably find forms like Eirikr or Eiricr or Eirijkr but I dont have any at hand at the moment so dont take it as gospel

Ive got to run now will address the rest of the question later Im actually more worried about the patronym
