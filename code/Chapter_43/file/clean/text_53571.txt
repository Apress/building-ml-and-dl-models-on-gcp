The organization of the list of bandleaders by Nationality in this article seems a bit arbitrary and perhaps not very useful  Would a different organization be better  For example by era pre1900 19001909 1910s 1920s 1930s etc or perhaps simply an alphabetical listing ignoring nationality or era   Its also not clear if the nationality headings listed should refer to the nationality of the band or to the nationality of the bandleader  For example Toshiko Akiyoshi led a North American big band for 30 years 10 years in Los Angeles and 20 years in New York but she herself is a Japanese citizen  although she has resided in the US for over 50 years
