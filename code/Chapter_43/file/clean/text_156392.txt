Copywrite violation 

I have just removed a large section from the article that was plagiarized from the USA Today article Fight for Ramadi exacts heavy toll on Marines archived by WebCite here It was added by the nowindefinitely blocked user Top Gun who is also the Wikipedia articles creator in November 2006 How could nobody have spotted this It was so obvious that The Battle section was copied verbatim from a news source and the sole inline reference even linked to the USA Today article by someone else Because it was referenced the plagiarism was eliminated but it was still a copyright violation
