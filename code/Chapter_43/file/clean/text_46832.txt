I disagree as this article has had a history of people trying to add irrelevant material to it such as the costs for proper supervision If you review WikipediaArticle titles it says emphasis added is my own  Article titles should be recognizable to readers unambiguous and consistent with usage in reliable Englishlanguage sources Also The ideal title for an article will also satisfy the other criteria outlined above ambiguous or inaccurate names for the article subject as determined by reliable sources are often avoided even though they may be more common For example tsunami is preferred over the arguably more common but less accurate tidal wave Leaving it as just Kosher tax has proven time and again to be too ambiguous and so per WPCOMMON I maintain that Kosher tax canard is a better proper title
