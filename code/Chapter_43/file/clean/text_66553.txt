This and that 

Hi Ganesh thanks for moving the message to the end of the talkpage I was planning to do that myself after replying to him btw you may have seen the query on WPINWNB about the INCOTW notice I tried fixing it but understood that it was getting updated by itself after some lag so I did nothing But for your note on my talkpage Id have missed this weeks INCOTW Good to see your participation in WikiProject Indian cinema lots needs to be done for Telugu cinema Ive been a destructive influence mostly tagging articles on Savitri and Bhanumati as copyvios But for Missamma and Maayabazaar not many classic telugu movies seem to be represented If you are interested you may want to have a go at them but some suggestions Try to develop an article at one go so that we can get it featured on DYK If it is people add CategoryTelugu people if it is films add CategoryTelugu films and of course as you would know copyvios are nono but some sources like telugucinemacom can be good source material for facts and trivia
