That is fine but expect that I will cut in to your parts of the article given I have the two paper sources and of course you should feel free to do the same  Or I can put a summary in my sandbox and you could work from that  Right now Im just reviewing and helping out  I have nothing prepared after my current FACs clear and will probably put in a couple of intensive days to try to finish up Macdonald early next week and try to get old John A to PR  I have him up to the early 1880s so another decade and then an assessment section  Ill start reviewing the NiC sources next day or two
