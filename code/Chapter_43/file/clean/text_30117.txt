What was the point of this Doesnt the Old Testament say the Amalekites were supposedly destroyed including even their women children and donkeys being exterminated As for when the unrelated people on the list of the relatively modern historical figures you mentioned died what does that have do with anything And I fail to see any supposed pattern or anything as that seems to be what this section was trying to imply or something I assume Also there are many Jewish holidays that span the calendar so different historical figures who are obviously going to die anyway are quite unsurprisingly and uneventfully going to die close a relative term as it is to any of these many possibilities on different calendars
