ok thats fine you can take the US out of that part but if a device is released the following year or later it is  considered its SUCCESSOR hence why someone would put st or 2nd etcbecause yout have 2 deices be called absolutely the same thing because theyre not  they have different hardware  software and spec and its from the same maker and family model hence why its referenced as 1st gen etc etcso how do you explain apples devices lolthe clealy release a new iphone every year and other hardware makers do so as wellthe word generation means something or someone of the same family but with newer hardware released or born laterin hardware its usually a yearly thingbut if you prefer a model number which is more specific im willing to compromise that the point is you cant name it the smae thing if its not the same exact product you have to put something to tell them apart and i dont think its enough to just put a year the said model was released xxxx but ok fine but i know others would disagree with you because what makes this device different from other devices that apple releases and has them in generation order its in the apple ios devices article in wiki itself and apple calls its products by generation and names its a matter of being as  specific as possible so users wont get confused and know exactly what something is its extremely helpful to many you might not think so but and many others do especially if a device maker calls its products of different models released in the future the same thing then how can you tell them apart if you call for example all      your phones samsung galaxy but they dont not usually but the best way to know is to put the model numberi mean i ont know your way of logic but you are contradicting the way a lot of articles i seen have been done here and yes i know you do things different so do i as far as im concerned most of the tech world and device makers refer to the products of their same family but released later as generations besides having different names and model namesbut the thing for exampleAmazon Fire TV guess what what you go to the website of it and its called the SAME THING most people wouldnt know the 1 in the website is the newer  2nd GEn model because there was the original or first gen model came out last yeari mean most of the tech world follow this trendyou have to put something to tell things apart from 1 another whether its a name model  the generation it is etc thats why i put that because it is true go look it up and read articles about it when they compare that model to the 1 last year its referred as 1st and 2nd gen models by the  industry at times to tell them apart  most dont know there was a previous model of the amazon fire tv the average consumer isnt tech savvy i am i love technology and you have to be as specific as possible so readers know exactly what something is  i mean yes i know amazoncom doesnt have their 2014 and 2015 amazon firetv microconsoles with 1 or 2 next to them to tell the apart and i did put parenthesis when i put 1st and 2nd gen on them meaning thats not part of its name its put there so people know what is whatthats one of the purposes or parenthesis it looks like youre being very picky and stalkish a bit because i told you how i felt you are looking into every single edit i ever made to point out errors or disagreements  lolthats a little low and immature dont you think the way im editing hasnt been an issue for the readers i know the appreciate my efforts probable better than some of the editors here how many times you or your brethren going to be harassing me on this huh what you are doing is called HARASSMENT and i would know besides the fact im a LAW STUDENT and tech savvy but im not gonna get in a debate over nonsensetheres nothing wrong with my edits other than being more informative and most of all COMPLETE i dont leave blank spaces and little info i put 110 of everything i do especially in my editsstop harassing me and sending me nonsense notes on little insignificant thingsif i change a letter of a misspelling you guys going to make a big deal about that too i try to follow the standards as best i could and as far as im concerned im doing absolutely nothing wrong and im well within my rights STOP HARASSING ME  you or your other acolytes yes i said acolytes with little nonsense if i was doing something terribly wrong i would be getting complaints from readers or editors 24 7what you and your other associates are doing is called harassment im not doing nothing wrong i just have a different more complete and thorough way of doing things so refrain from messaging me every 5 seconds of nonsense and stop stalking its creepy and in some casesILLEGAL but alright i wont put US  on it because well some products do get released in the same continent the same day but i pu
