Wow youre complaining to me now 13 days after I replied  It is up to any editor on Wikipedia to consider whether an article is within reason to post as speedy deletion  Since I was not the person who actually deleted the article only the person who suggested to have the article deleted please do not gripe on my talk page telling me how I should or should not contribute to Wikipedia  If you have further questions please contact the administrator responsible for deleting your article  Please also note If you have problems with other people editing or deleting your material dont post it  I didnt come up with that either  Its one of Wikipedias many policies  I suggest you read up   talk  contribs
