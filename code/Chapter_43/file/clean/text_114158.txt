This is rediculous I indeed have several accounts at Gamefaqs but most of them I have are newly created ones either closed or banned by Gamefaqs moderators If you look at the details of this Fenriswolf person

Fenris has been at Gamefaqs for nearly 4 years whereas I have only stumbled across Gamefaqs in early 2005 I have seen Fenriswolfs posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government Myself however is an Australian citizen Although I do not oppose the Chinese government I support eventual democracy in China and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government then why didnt I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government I reverts some of TJives edits due to his choice of wording such as his insistance in calling certain governments regimes and his tendency to edit without discussion dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page If you look at my edit history I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars and has contributed lots to sciencefiction and videogame related articles Its unfair to judge me as a vandal based TJives hearsay as I do not have such resources this Fenriswolf person claimed other than my home computer What concrete evidence do you have to block me indifinitely other than TJives hearsay
