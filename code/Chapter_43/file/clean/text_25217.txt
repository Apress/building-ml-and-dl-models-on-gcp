____Interesting discussions here although we all have to admin that their is lack of sources most of the sources we have are nonenglish If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans Because they were major player in history of india I think most of their era was spend in India I remember Karturaghtis mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim invaders
 Also talk The Iranicas is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanianmiddle persian and it comes the word from the name  Wišnasp and who was  Wišnasp what or who was  Wišnasp Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi Namenbuch in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details So we believe in that just because Iranica says so I personally dont see any logical trace between  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves antipersian Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids who were panabbasids 
The most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem
