Wrong Focus 

Im new here but it seems to me that this page as it now reads IS about IHDCAD to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease  While it may be true that the term is usually used to refer to those diseases related to atherosclerosis arterial disease I would suggest that this is careless usage to which this page need not subscribe So how should the article be structured Id say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section with links in the relevant anatomic regions  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease Valvular Heart Disease Cardiomyopathies Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities Diseases of the Coronary Arteries Diseases of the Pericardium Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease Other Peripheral Vascular Disease Arteritides Systemic Hypertension Thrombosis and Embolic Disease Other Venous System Disease Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature and Heart Failure and Transplantation Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy physiologydiagnosis and therapy would also be germane Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease
