NPOV  Poor quality very biased 

This article is one of the worst country articles I have seen It ONLY shows the good sides of China completely ignores other very important facts The words used are very NPOV and while facts are wellsourced the article itself presents it in a NPOV way There is MUCH more negative side to the Chinese economy than simply super fast growth And there is simply no mention of that kind The introduction needs to be written  it is literally a collection of brags about China nothing more
