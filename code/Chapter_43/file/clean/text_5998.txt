A user has reverted an edit that was going to include a UAV in the list  The reason stated was that A UAV isnt a specific aircraft and the Army isnt part of the RAAF  There are quite a few aircraft in the list that are not part of the RAAF  Moreover all future helicopter purchases are most likely going to be either Army or RAN   Therefore we either remove all RAN and Army aircraft or we move the page to List of aircraft of the ADF  If youre up to it we can vote to move the page as below and I will do any changes if any next week Mon 19th March     
support  it will make the list more comprehensive and keep the current intent
