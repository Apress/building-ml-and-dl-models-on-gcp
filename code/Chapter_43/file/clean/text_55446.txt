To say we should let the reader decide whether the information is innocuous misses the point  The paragraph thats now protected contains misinformation but lets put that aside for the moment  The question is not whether the incident reflects badly on Kennedy but whether its important enough to include in this article  We have to make judgments about that  Theres a discussion going on right now at the George W Bush article about including a reference to the calls for impeaching Bush  You could write a factually accurate sentence or paragraph about it but most of us think it should be omitted anyway because its just not important  No one has even suggested as far as I remember that the Bush article include a paragraph about his brother and the Silverado scandal  Neil Bush was actually fined and restricted from future banking activity whereas Smith was acquitted of the rape charge but getting into accusations against an article subjects relatives is too peripheral except in rare situations
