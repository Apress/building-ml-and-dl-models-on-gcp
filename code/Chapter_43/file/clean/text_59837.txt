Hello JoOdoe again I would like to remind you that Wikipedia is not a place to practice your English so please try to listen also Let me make this very clear
Social science is not science If you go to University and get a degree in History you will get a degree called a Bachelor of Arts That doesnt mean that you dont have a degree nor does it mean that you are not an academic It means that you are not a scientist
On the other hand if you go to University and get a degree in statistics or economics you will get a degree called Bachelor of Science That means that you are both a scientist and an academic 
This is your last free English lesson academinscientist 
Please adopt a less beligerent attitude
Thanks   0939 4 October
