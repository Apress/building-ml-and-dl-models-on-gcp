Theory of MultiDimensional Scalable Worlds
By Dr Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of MultiDimensional Scalable Worlds  

When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe 

Principle I  Empiric  Entity and World Scale relationship 
In the Universe each Entity constellation star planet animal vegetable micro organism molecule  belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE Average Life Time Scale and the SPACE SCALE Average Size Scale of the Entity 

Principle II  Empiric  The fulfillment principle 
Each particular Entity in its Space Scale has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to also complete its life cycle with success 

Principle III  Empiric  World Scales existence 
According to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us  microorganisms molecules atoms   and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us  planets stars constellations  

Principle IV  Empiric  Time and Space Relationship 
The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity 
Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales  the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly  so there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration 
Example of an empiric formula that can be applied 

Life_Scale  K x Space_Scale 
 K  30 yearsmeters for mammals  

Principle V  Empiric  Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence 
In Euclids geometry if we consider ourselves a point in a plan we only can observe just a line this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world we only can percept one dimension 
The same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale X Y Z and Time there is at least another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in Only using the imaginary complex number i1 ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong 
This takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with at least an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand because they are imaginary to us i1 ½ 

Principle VI  Empiric  Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective 
Can we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i1 ½ 
So we have to introduce two new concepts the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence 
RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale 
RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scales Relative Perspective By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials 
So the Human Kind or any other Entity only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real and not Imaginary in the World Scale of that Entity Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions i1 ½ in their mathematical models 

Principle VII  Empiric  The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle 
Why our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but instead the cosmos is splitting itself How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand Obviously there is at least an extra imaginary dimension that we cannot percept or understand from our World Scale X Y Z and Time that relates the different MULTIDIMENSIONAL WORLD SCALES above and
