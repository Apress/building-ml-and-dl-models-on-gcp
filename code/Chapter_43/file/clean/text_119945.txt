Image Tagging ImageVasanthamjpg

 This media may be deleted

Thanks for uploading ImageVasanthamjpg I notice the image page currently doesnt specify who created the content so the copyright status is unclear If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia see copyright tagging below If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found ie in most cases link to the website where it was taken from and the terms of use for content from that page

If the media also doesnt have a copyright tag then one should be added If you createdtook the picture audio or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL If you believe the media qualifies as fair use consider reading fair use and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at WikipediaImage copyright tagsFair_use  See WikipediaImage copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use

If you have uploaded other media consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them too You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting Image from the dropdown box Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you
