You hijacked an obsolete image that I had removed from my site Then you posted it at a free photo hosting site Then you linked to it prominently from two Wikipedia articles Have you ever thought that I might have good reasons for pulling that image I complained to the free hosting site and they took it down within a matter of hours They know a bit more about copyright law than you do it would seem Your antics have earned you a place on httpwwwwikipediawatchorghivemindhtml Please stop harassing me
