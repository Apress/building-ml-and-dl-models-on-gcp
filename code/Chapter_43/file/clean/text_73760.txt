NN POV  Material is not notable and appears to be a POV push against the subject the band Insane Clown Posse  Structural bias in article title Gay ICP as well  
Delete of course I am the nominator   
Comment on further inquiry article Gay ICP seems to be the worst creation of  
Huh Hasnt Kasreyn vandalized the main ICP page 
 Why is this here Any claims on sexual preferences of the band belong on the band article ICP but Kasreyn has edited this addition and many others out because it didnt coincide with his POV  
Keep it per nom  
Keep it as above  UlTiMuS    T  C  E  
Comment  Im seeing very strong support here does anyone agree this is a case for a speedy delete   
What Been hearing voices Kasreyn Aside from your numerous comments Kasreyn I dont see much support of your POV 
Comment I wouldnt speedy delete this article I disagee that this material is unreliableI think it is notable and not designed to bias the subject any more than it would be to say that Charles Nelson Reilly is gay That said I do believe that the structural bias in the article title is unacceptable so this article should probably be deleted but its content merged with the main article I think its a biased attempt by fans of ICP to keep this information out of the main article and that the creator of this article was taking a valid stand by creating it if ICP fans are putting their own POV in the article  
Comment Im not sure on what grounds you can propose to delete this article or a remove it from the main ICP article 
Comment It is that noteworthy and verified  The text makes a reference to an interview in a magazine  I have found the source of the material  The article lists four references which are quite relevant information and are only there to make the article more substantial  Personally I am not a fan of the group or their style of music and do not care if the statements are true or false  I am just trying to preserve the integrity of the article If you can show me one valid reason for deletion then I would consider supporting removing this from wiki  
Save it I personally verified these sources and they all exceed expectations Riviting stuff people Riddlebox Wraithz 
Hold on per all the lovely comments above  I dont think its speedyible under wikipedian legislation at all Northenglish 
Interesting Its interesting and more than just POV since its verifiably true  It might be worth briefly mentioning it in the main ICP article as well 
Agreed per nom
