Quantum of Solace
Perhaps its too early to make a judgement but the early prereviews of the film are quite awful When I found out that Jack White was doing the theme tune alarm bells began ringing The Bolvivian location and plot in especially in relation to the title seems too far fetched even by Bond standards although the plot in a way seems quite SPECTRE esque looks like it is full of action scenes though The baddy doesnt exactly look the most menacing either does he Bring back myself I say Also I prefer my films well over 2 hours this film is the shortest of the films so far Mmm I guess Ill have to wait a week to find out What do you think
