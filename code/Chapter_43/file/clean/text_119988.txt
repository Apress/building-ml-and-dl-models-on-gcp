Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text Ive checked and he or she is right there is no mention of Young at IMDb the films page or her own homepage That UserShelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that shes not Shelby Young moreover if she were she shouldnt be editing the article on herself Mel Etitis Talk  

I havent taken a stance on the role dispute Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited and IMDB doesnt list uncredited actors I believe My comment was geared more toward UserShelbyyoungs user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity This IP address shouldnt be removing that Leebo TC  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification so if the real Young did appear in the film it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing heck even my kid is in the IMDb and her scene only appears as an alternate ending Thats got little to do with the impersonation questionOrange Mike  

1 Leebo is correct IMDB doesnt list uncredited actors only on special occasions in fact See the case of Owen Wilson in Night at the Museum No onscreen credit therefore no IMDB credit It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials his credit was added 
2 Regarding the film page the page only lists the main actors involved in the film Its not going to list a voiceover actress

3 Shelbyyoungcom has not been updated since 20042005 so no credit after that would appear on the site and is therefore an invalid source

4 Many people have edited articles on themselves here To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic I dont know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello who claimed to be the real thing then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a then 14yearold To my mind the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself and the photo which 69132199100 claims is photoshopped and what a lovely trick that would be proves Shelbyyoungs identity 69132199100 claims that the photo is a popular one that has been photoshopped If so where is it I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search Ispy1981 

Jiust to make clear on the last point that I offered no such argument Mel Etitis Talk
