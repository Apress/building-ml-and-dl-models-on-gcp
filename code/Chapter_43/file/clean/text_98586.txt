Discussion requires both parties to explain their actions Pages are not owned by individuals or groups of friends to stifle dissent which seems to be the real problem I have explained my edits a number of times though no explanation was offered on the content itself by the reverter Reverting an explained restoration of content is edit warring and bringing others in to circumvent WP3RR is not WPGood Faith or proper behavior Those who find it hard to work with others should remember that it takes two hands to clap Anything else need not be said on my talk which is a personal space but on the article talk
