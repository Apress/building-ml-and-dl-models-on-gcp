Tony Award Discussion  

Hello  there is a discussion happening at the bottom of this page  about if the nominations list should have character names or not I know you have tried adding character names to Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play and I have as well and the creator of the list keeps taking them off I think the character names are an important part of the list and should be there 
Let us know your thoughts on this Thanks
