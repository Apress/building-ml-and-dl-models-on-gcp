Replaceable fair use ImageAndrzej Tomasz Zapałowskijpg 

Thanks for uploading ImageAndrzej Tomasz Zapałowskijpg I noticed the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information If you believe this image is not replaceable please

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add  without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template
 On the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all

Alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself

If you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on  this link Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification 7 days if not used in an article per our Fair Use policy  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you
