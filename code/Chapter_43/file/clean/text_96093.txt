No Im not from the ATKV I discovered your draft after I was unable to find an ATKV link for a different article I was working on
 It looks like you made a few changes and IMHO its already a good article
 Yes the history of Afrikaans is well documented on the Afrikaans page But many readers will not be aware of it I think it will provide some context to mention how rapidly the language was changing when the ATKV was founded
