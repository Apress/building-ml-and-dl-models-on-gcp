It would appear to me that most of the administrators I have been dealing with are self righteous and so impressed by the fact that they are Almighty Administrators that they have entirely no sense of humor whatsoever  You talk really tuff as though you are really going show me a thing or two  I think you just enjoy the feeling of power that you have over my life  With one click of the keyboard you can destroy my article for good  I guess you think Im supposed to be devastated or something  Suppose I am banned from Wikipedia once more for speaking freely  Its really not going change the Earths rotation rate or anything  I guess if you dont have a life and are condemned to sitting around and watching encyclopedia entries all day without getting paid for it then you might turn out to be humorless and irritable  How can I be accused of vandalizing a page that I created  I will admit to vandalizing Lucky 69s page but I think its really idiotic to say that a person vandalized a page that they created  Ive seen some really stupid pages on Wikipedia that were written by Administrators  I often wonder why these articles were allowed to remain  The article I created is about a real person
