Ill remove the whole sentence Give me a day or two to source something which can be referenced and Ill do a swap Im actually not interested in arguing about peacock terms quite ironic since all male editors here are peacocks by default and all the male musicians that have a biographical entry are also peacocks  I think you will find in nature that it is mostly the male of the species that does the big noisy or colorful display or original research quite ironic since no author of any work in existence has ever written a book that didnt contain original research I challenge anyone to find a book with references of any kind  that doesnt contain one or two sentences expressing a personal view which therefore constitutes original research We are in essence using references from peacocks who themselves have used unreferenced sentences to display loudly to other males their intellectual prowess

Which seems to be what we male editors spend a lot of time arguing about on Talk Pages under the guise of rules and guidelines lol
