This article does an awful job maintaining an objective viewpoint it is undeniable It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and cosponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003

It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an F rating last Congressional session Absolutely misleading

I do not often edit wikipedia and am not quite sure how to correctly cite these facts This page does not paint an accurate portrait of Mark KirkI ask somebody to help me correctly cite the credible sources of these facts in order to maintain this great sites credibility 749394125  an informed voter in the tenth district
