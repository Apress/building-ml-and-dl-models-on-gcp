Cleanup 

 known in Croatian as Juraj Julije KloviÄ‡ was an illuminator miniaturist and painter of Croat origin who worked in Italy1  removed and replaced by the earlier version due to several facts
 it was mentioned later that Croats thinks that Clovios real name was Juraj Julije Klovic  no need to say it twice
 Croat origin  rather his birth place is in todays Croatia He was of Macedonian lineage
 who worked in Italy  impprecise and incorrect he was educatedtrained in Italy lived in Papal State and Venice died in Rome and belonged to the Italian Rennaisance painters circle

 about nonexistent Kingdom of Croatia  full report given above

 removed Vatican City post stamp Christmas 1998  500th anniversary of the birth of Julius Clovius Croatus as a valid reference due to the fact that this reference is a chat site

 moved httpwwwpostahrmainaspxid193idmarke312 from International to the Croatian references

 removed completely Under Clovios bust beside his name is written the name of his homeland Pictor de Croatia1 Painter from Croatia as a false claim Also reference 1 has another false claim Klovic used to sign himself as GEORGIVS JVLIVS CLOVIVS CROATA which disqualifies  completely as a valid reference
