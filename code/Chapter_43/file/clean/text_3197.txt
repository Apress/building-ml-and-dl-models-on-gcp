Big Boi
My babys drama mama dont like me
She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 
to the studio tryin to fight me
She need to get a piece of the american pie and take her bite out
Thats my house Ill disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck
Private school daycare shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything but see I aint the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my childs birthday I aint invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you yeah

CHORUS
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Andre 3000
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin on
You say its puppy love arf arf arf
We say its full grown ARF ARF WOOF
Hope that we feel this feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you cant predict the weather Ms Jackson

Ten times out of nine now if Im lyin fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and Ill decline
King meets queen then the puppy love thing together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree I hope we feel like this forever
Forever forever ever forever ever
Forever never seems that long until youre grown
And notice that the day by day ruler cant be too long
Ms Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me thoughts of she thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had I pray so much about it need some knee pads
It happened for a reason one cant be mad
So know this know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school 
and graduation

CHORUS
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Big Boi
Uh uh yeah
Look at the way he treats me 
Shit look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosyass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl aint speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
You know what Im talking about Jealousy infidelity envy
Cheating to beating and D to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

CHORUS
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson OOOH
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
