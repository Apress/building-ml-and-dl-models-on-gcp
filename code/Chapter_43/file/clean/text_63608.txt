I cant tell you any such thing  What meets criterion a doesnt meet b  Apparently no one else has anything to support the current  language either  Walter Nissen talk 20100719 2041

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of plus or minus 
and why he chose Smoots Ear for his title
httptechmiteduV127N43smoothtml
This is an account by Marie Y Thibault of Tavernors speech at MIT 
about his book with Smoot in attendance

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoots Ear and plus or minus
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title
Both open with  1 ear
Its presented by Tavernor as the historical basis ie the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque and the 
decades of paint on the bridge
Both derive plus or minus from  1 ear
Neither states that the historical measurement was plus or minus 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor The significance of
Smoots Ear is that is stands for an approximation a plus or
minus
Smoots Ear is a component of the historical measurement
 1 ear
stands for is clearly not an historical recounting
but a reference to Tavernors interpretation
Hes distinguishing the earlier Ear from his contribution
plus or minus

If plus or minus were already part of the historical record it
wouldnt be necessary or desirable to begin with  1 ear

Plus or minus was not part of the historical record it was
introduced for purposes of this discussion by Tavernor as
his interpretation not part of the historical record   
Tavernors account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end explaining how the ear in  1 ear from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book beginning
with plus or minus ie uncertainty

Tavernor isnt trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge
nor measured on the bridge
quite the contrary that he took this human measurement with a
component obviously intended to provoke inter alia the notion
of uncertainty and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it

It doesnt matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 3644 Smoots plusminus an Ear
He could say it 300 times
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear
That has its own truth
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms
From what are they derived
Tavernor tells us
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement 3644 smoots  1 ear

Tavernors first reference citation within his book for the 
Preface which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
httpwwwnprorgtemplatesstorystoryphpstoryId5043041
Thats the one I quoted earlier 
 20051207 
Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if its measured in smoots
Mr SMOOT himself 
Three hundred and sixtyfour point four plus one ear
Itd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found plus or minus
there
Also he repeatedly cites WP which at the time didnt have
plus or minus
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to rewrite history that he was 
not well situated to know about this he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept of Sociology who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read

Tavernors Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Years Day 2008 as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add  but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to  1 ear
 didnt arise on the bridge it showed up in Tavernors
Preface
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect

If no one can say what from Tavernors Preface seems to a conform 
to WPNOR and b support the current language of the 5 
articles then yes this would be an excellent time to revert to 
something only a minor copyedit different than the language which
