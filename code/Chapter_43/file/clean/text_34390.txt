Well we also have the fairusenoalternative and fairusereplace tags which would be good to get using Also all the boiler plate justification tags should have a fair use in field We should require a seperate justification for each instance of use then use a robot to detect extra links Half is probably correct but still pretty ambitious as there remain 133767 fair use tagged images and that isnt even considering the additional 100k my estimation based on random sampling mistagged as something not fair use Ive gotten about 19000  deleted so far but just that small amount has caught me so much flak
