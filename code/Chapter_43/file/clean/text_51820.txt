I dont think the article would be of much value if it were about the designation I mean one day the object was listed in a catalog and given a number Big deal The interesting subject is what sorts of things are acceptable for names and who makes the rules and who enforces them and examples of objects that have undergone this process etc And then one day it got a number and a designation  thats suitable for a sentence or two somewhere So the Minor planet naming appeals to me more
