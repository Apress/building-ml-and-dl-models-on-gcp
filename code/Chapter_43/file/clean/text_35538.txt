What I find especially funny is that molecular anthropology rather supports these racial typologies  because every distinct physical type developed due to a founder effect and long isolation And this is clearly visible in DNA If Dinarics were isolated much longer from their neighbours they would inevitably developed into a separate race I wonder if authors copying these obsolete statements from the beginnings of population genetics actually check what has changed in the meantime
