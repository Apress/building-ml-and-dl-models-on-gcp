Alternative Judaism
Zain I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further since I think you might have misread some of them Also remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the Israelites and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points and that you added to the article

 AngloIsraelism  Never claimed to be Jews they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article
 Christian Identity  Weird choice  They hate Jews look at the text of the article where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism nor are they Jews
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity or possibly Messianic Judaism which is already in the article
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians not a current group  This is like including Jews Harp in the list  it is a reference to a historical label not a religion
 Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited
 Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism
 Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion but another good place to put these sort of links
 BritishIsraelWorld Federation  See AngloIsraelism

I am open to discussion on these but do read through the article first  Do you agree or disagree with these points It would be good to get this resolved
