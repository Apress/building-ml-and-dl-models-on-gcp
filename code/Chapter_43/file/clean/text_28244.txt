Pocket billards 

The term pocket billiards is used inconsistently in the article Does it mean
Pool or pocket billiards generally played on a table with six pockets  where pocket billiards links to pool cue sports
or is it a generic name for all billiard type games played on a table with pockets as in its is used in the section Cue sportsMajor games carom and pocket Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote

Where Pocket billiards links to Pool cue sports

In a similar way the section Cue sportsList of cue sports says that English billiards another hybrid of  Carom billiards games but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocketless Carom games and if Snooker see below popularly regarded as its own sport not a pool variant is its own sport so is English billiards

If it can not be decided what Pocket billiards means in American English and Commonwealth English then we should avoid using the term or define what we mean by it before it is used in the article Also I do not think that sources over 30 years old should be used to define a term like Pocket billiards as language changes and usage of such phrases does as well Eg if the American professional organisations  have been pressing for it to mean pool type games and snooker professional organisations tend not to use the term then it is probably better to define it that American way and stick with that American usage in an article such as this

If Pocket billiards turns out not to have one meaning and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sportsList of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports
