No  and ŋ are the same sound and in phonetics no one uses ŋ My point is that in the system used here an fheall is transcribed with   conventional n or   conventional N while a ngeall is transcribed with   conventional ŋ just as geall is transcribed with   conventional g gheall with j or   conventional  ceann with c  conventional k and cheann with ç  conventional x Basically the entire palatal series of IPA is used for the Irish slender velars the article uses  rather than  for conventional L for precisely this reason I dont know whether x is velar or uvular for most speakers but I do know that all the sources I checked call it velar so thats what the article says Wikipedia has to reflect whats been published not what readers and editors know in our hearts and ears to be true cf WikipediaVerifiability Of course you have to define how you use your symbols and I believe this article does but for the sake of consistency with other phonology articles at Wikipedia this article sticks to symbols that are official parts of the IPA I do think there will be more readers familiar with IPA than with the traditional symbols of Irish philology and for those readers who are more familiar with the latter WPIPAga which is linked to at the top of this article should clear up any confusion gr
