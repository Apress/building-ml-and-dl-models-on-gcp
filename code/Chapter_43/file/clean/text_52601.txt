People do not use family in the way you are describing have you ever said my family are taking a vacation this summer or the whole family are sick

I do not know why you are insisting on making the sentence awkward and bizarre It is not appropriate the way you are using it I have offered to work with you and instead you are just reverting the sentence This is not helpful and does not improve the article

I have made a different edit this time This one is just as accurate as all of the other sentences I have written but makes distributions the subject Hopefully that will be more to your liking
