 Re Block Log on user 621711985 

Sir I wish to ask if you would consider extending the ban on this IP for the persistent and annoying way they seem to wish to disrupt the wikipedia  Previous bans of 24 and 31 hours have obviously slowed things down but the IP is reported as belonging to Research Machines Inc and its understood that abuse of this IP would result in reports of network abuse to be passed to them  

The IP has an extraordinarily long list of vandalism attached to its name and I can barely find one edit under the user contributions which is not or does not amount to outright vandalism  Could I please ask therefore that you consider extending this ban to 48 hours or thereabouts  Previous bans seem to have had no effect since the talk page for this IP is full of bans and vandalism warnings  

Please understand that I would never question the decision of an administrator as I am not one myself and would consider that the height of rudeness  All I ask is whether you could please reconsider the ban and possibly extend it  Thank you    Thors pet yack
