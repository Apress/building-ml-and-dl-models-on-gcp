If He Was Terrorist 

Czech President Miloš Zeman has criticized Ukrainian leaders Stepan Bandera 190959 and Roman Shukhevych 190750 saying he cannot congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes in his response to an open letter by four Ukrainian studies scholars and historians

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Banderas statement Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years and whether they agree with it
If you have not heard these words by Bandera you are not ukrainists And if you know about that statement then do you agree with him or not If you agree then our debate is over  wrote Zeman He continues saying Bandera wanted to establish a vassal German state in the Ukraine   httpwwwpraguepostcomworldnews43706zemancriticizeshistoricalukrainianleaders
