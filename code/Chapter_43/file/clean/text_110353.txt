Hello James  it seems that the banned sock puppet account of that religious User from Pakistan is back  

Hello James  i have to contact you directly  because i don t want to start a war edit  I do believe that user Rahtujabi from Pakistan  or he was called something like that because i do not remember the name exactly  that you have banned multiple times operating multiple sock puppet accounts in order to promote a religious extremist agenda  is back again  I had contacted you some time ago 3 months ago aproximately when he was vandalizing the article about Albania  with 3 sock puppet accounts  and you banned him and all his sock puppet accounts  

Please can you check the connection of users   Mingling2   رائد عزمي حموده   79112121127  

These 3 users did the exact same edit to avoid the 3 reverts rule  they all seem to be preocupied with religious matters on global scale based on their contributions history  

As demonstrated here  Revision as of 1044 18 February 2014 by رائد عزمي حموده  Revision as of 1511 20 February 2014 by 79112121127  Revision as of 1559 21 February 2014 by  Mingling2  All these users are making the same revert in a timespan of 2 days  Their contributions history is also only about religion   

Second revert that now Mingling2 is trying to do  is remove a Sourced  very valuable image within its historical context that is located there   Why would this be somehow connected to a religious matter  The answer is because SKANDERBEG  the national hero of Albania  was a christian  as the whole population of Albania before getting occupied by the muslim ottomans  that fought the ottomans and won countless of times  until his death  After his death  the ottomans did occupy the whole albania  and made by force a part of its population muslim  So thats where the connection is  By hiding one of the most important battles of Albania against the ottomans  he wants to hide this fact 

Revision as of 1555 23 February 2014 by Mingling2  

His ridiculous explanation of removing an established  very important  very relevant and sourced image  that has always been there as per consensus with previous users  which is DIRECTLY connected with the ottoman period in Albania  is non Standing in any way shape or form  

This guy is user Rasturhabji  i am betting my everything on that 

Regards
