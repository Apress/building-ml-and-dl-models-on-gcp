Im keying off the very first bullet point If possible an article title is the subject of the first sentence of the article  The article name is Breast and so the subject of first sentence should match  As others have pointed out the subject is Breast not Breasts a subtle yet distinct difference  Id also point to WPCON your change doesnt appear to have that either
