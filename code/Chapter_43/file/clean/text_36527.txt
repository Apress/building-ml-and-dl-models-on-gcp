I understand that duncan sometimes look at the refs in disbelief but you have got to put yourself in his position and think how he must feel when going down the clutch He gets stepped on by nowitzki which causes Nowitzki to twist his ankle and get Tim fouled out from a very important game Or how frustrating it must be to pass the ball to something else on your team and a jump ball be called It is just unbelievable Its like saying jason terry did not punch finley 
and you do agree that avery did try to waste his fouls on tim duncan so why is it that you say that every play down the defensive end mavs get called for a foul If you agree with the stragedy avery is trying to put out Because you did say this he obviously didnt act like it because that strategy is only smart if youre using second and third string players to do the fouling and if you look at the stats you will see that his second and third string players were in foul trouble or fouled out and so were his first string Avery Had Dampier on duncan as 1st and 2nd string Diop 1st and 2nd String And Kieth Van Horn 3rd String All on Tim Duncan So what is not understandable here Look at the stats to see if they did not play that stragedy or waste his fouls 4 fouls in 4 minutes by kieth van horn make sense
