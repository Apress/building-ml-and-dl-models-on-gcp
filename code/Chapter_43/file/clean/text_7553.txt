Thx for the explanation Just for the avoidance of any doubt my comment was not meant to criticise or discredit you in any way As one can easily see from your manner to edit and discuss you are a prudent and reasonable man To be honest I just inserted the comment because I had thought what would Rex have said in case 213DutchBloke had reverted his comments back to Pauls EARTHQUAKE However I actually know that you do not apply double standards Cheers
