Thanks for your suggestions Hpvpp I can tell that you really care about this issue But honestly I think its a terrible suggestion Structuring discussion of linguistic relativity around the SapirWhorf hypothesis on one hand and fictional languages on the other with or without splitting would be like structuring discussion of Special relativity around electrodyanmics on one hand and fictional space ships on the other Yes notions of linguistic relativity have been important in some sectors of speculative fiction just as notions of fasterthatlight travel have been in others That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics As Maunus says this article is and ought to be about the linguistic and philosophical treatment of various notions of linguistic relativity not about their uptake in fiction among creators of constructed languages or in other creative applications

A history of scholarship on language and thought may or may not be useful I wonder a if it would serve as the sort of basic encyclopedic need of this project or might it be better suited to some sister project such as Wikiversity or Wikibooks and b whether such a history would be possible without original research via synthesis In any case it would be neither a replacement for this article nor a subsection of it but a broader category that includes it
