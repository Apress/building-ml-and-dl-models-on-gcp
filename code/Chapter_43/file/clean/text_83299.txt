RFC discussion of your username  
Hello  and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia Wikipedia has a policy on what usernames editors can use Unfortunately concerns have been raised that your username may be incompatible with that policy  You can contribute to the discussion about it here Alternatively if you agree that your username may be problematic and are willing to change it it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under a new name Simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page rather than creating a whole new account Thank you
