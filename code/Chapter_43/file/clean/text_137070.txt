The urination incident 

Hello Im just contacting you since Ive seen that you have paid attention to this in the past An editor named  has recently placed a rather long rant on TalkFergie singer Basicly it seems that they have decided that the consensus to keep it was not a consensus because they say so That the sourses previously decided to be reliable are not for the same reason and that looking up information and then adding it to wikipedia constitutes original research I am not an expert and dont want to create and edit war I am just wondering what you think My opinions are well known and I am trying to not just assume that I am right but I thought this had been settled This person doesnt seem to be offering anything but the same old reasons to keep it out the reasons that we had disscussed and then decided to keep it in I have poor grammar and spelling I know
