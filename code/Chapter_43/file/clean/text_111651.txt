It would appear that you think you must frequently edit Wikipedia in order to have any experience with it  As I explained in the witch hunt thread about my alleged sockpuppetry I frequently read Wikipedias ANI thread  Ive been doing it for years  I found it a long time ago and I enjoy reading it  For me its hilarious to see some blatant vandals try to wiggle their way out of blocks  Plus theres always some absurd editors who just make a scene  I read your thread which was one of the most entertaining Ive ever read  Then as a service to you I registered a name because I didnt see that youd taken a break  I understand now that you did take a break and I already apologized for my mistake  Why do you think that I must be stalking you in order to come across your page  To me thats a little out there man  Of course I dont know much about your history  Perhaps youre a little sensitive on the matter because of some past experience  In either case Id be more than happy to end this communication and wish you all the best as Ive already suggested but you continued to badger me with your previous post  Or for all I care you can just block this username  It wont stop me from browsing Wikipedia like I have in the past  Either way is fine but I hope you realize that I was just trying to lend a helping hand  Its offensive that this has gone this far
