Why are you harassing me
No
The arbcom decision based on a lie said I could only operate under one account I was continually harassed so I switched to a new account and stopped editing under this one

I have not broken any policies I have not edited any of the pages I used to edit because I knew you and Mackensen would immediately seek out confrontation

Why do you have to prove to the world that you are right and no other opinion is allowed after I stopped editing under Ya ya ya ya ya ya

Similarly you refuse to accept criticism so you vandalize my talkpage and revert every attempt to start an arbcom case on a blatant series of policy violations and then you act like Im not permanently banned

I let it the arbcom case I tried to file three times go when you began wikistalking me

Im switching accounts again

You dont like it Too bad
