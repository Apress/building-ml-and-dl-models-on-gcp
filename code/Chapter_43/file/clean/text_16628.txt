Third opinion 

Hey So Ive looked over the conversation here and to be honest I dont have any problem with the URL category It doesnt really strike as spam since they all seem to fit the inclusion criteria The links might be more gracefully included than just the standard numbered link  maybe have it say clearwikicom and have the link  but it seems okay Similarly WPNOTLINK doesnt apply here since there is a lot more meaningful data attached to the entries in the list

As a side note I think it would be most helpful to this article to either create articles for each of the entries on here or at least give some references as to why theyre notable I personally dont see the Alexa criterion as making it notable and instead Id just fall on WPWEB as a way of determining notability   say whaaat
