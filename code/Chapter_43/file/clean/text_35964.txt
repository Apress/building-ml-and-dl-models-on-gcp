Welcome to Wikipedia  Im glad you want to get involved but Im afraid theres a problem with the article you created   Stanley Quatavis Mitchell  It did not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia   Dont feel too badly lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article  You might find it useful to read Your First Article for some good advice about starting to create articles on Wikipedia  Two important rules of thumb are Avoid  writing about yourself your business your family and friends or your web page and avoid writing about anything that hasnt been written about in reliable sources like books newspapers and magazines  Anyway dont be discouraged  Ive deleted the article you created and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions  If Ive made a mistake and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria then please let me know my leaving me a message and links to at least three newspaper articles magazine articles or books that have been written about the subject and Ill be glad to undelete it and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake   talk  contribs
