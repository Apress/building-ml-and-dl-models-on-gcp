Thank you JA I know that you mean well but blueboar has a vile agenda to claim Masonic supremacy for his Grand Lodge over all others and he is prepared to attack us and any other respectable Grand Lodge in the process and by any means  For instance he deleted our Wiki page 18 months ago in its entirety and without a by your leave after I had spent the best part of a week setting it up  I have asked him here to justify his actions and you will notice that he cannot do so  He is to Masonic history what Rudolph Nureyev was to Aluminiun ElectroArc Welding  Peter Clatworthy
