again little of that is relevant whether true or not including the ridiculous allegation of a tantrum whatever the size personal talk is to be avoided on article talk pages so i wont comment further on your degree issues i encourage you though if youve time to consider reviewing the article history and perhaps noting who it was that first raised the issue of legality with regard to the killing of bonnie parker if too busy for that maybe you could at least revisit my comments above  especially the one in which i say that i agree with you that she was murdered im confused by your apparent fabrication of a conflict here when none exists except with respect to what can be stated factually in the article let me spell it out for you as far as that goes youre arguing a point with somebody who not only agrees with you but has stated so explicitly from the outset thats a good indicator that my problem with your edits is wikipediarelated not opinionrelated please let the personality side go and concentrate on editing in an encyclopedic fashion thanks  

Since I am back reediting this article you are right personality differences should play no role  but facts should  Wikipedia exists as a limitless repository of facts and the facts of Bonnies legal status are well known and need to be published  I think we agree on the facts we just need to put this article in more professional formOLDWIINDYBEAR121205

I feel my edits are well and professionally done in an encyclopedic fashion  As to the Bonnie Parker matter we agree she was murdered so it was merely finding language that was appropriate  I felt mine was you disagreed such is life  I still find your mode of discussion offensive but frankly we both have better things to do than bandy semantics so have a nice evening OLDWINDYBEAR

 Hikaru Utada song 

The song BC by Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada names Bonnie and Clyde in its lyrics Is this too obscure to be a relevant pop culture reference Lyrics can be found here

nothing wrong with popping it in to see if it stays i dont think its any more obscure than other stuff there  

 why wikipedia ultimately sucks 

it requires perpetual vigilance if your efforts not to be wasted cant walk away from solid ground job done this article was stable and its now being degraded regularly by wannabe newspaper editorialists and overt point makers using the note insertion method do a POV jig here thrust another there its like watching a dog wander a field to lift his leg whenever something catches his nose inserting sentences here and there is the laziest most worthless editing one can do may as well use a red sharpie but im not touching this article have at it convert the investment of many good editors into your pee ground forcing them either to acquiesce or follow some snot nose around with kleenex preserving a precious syllable as able look johnny you pooped out a syllable that we kept arguing for 5 hours with a dull gasbag in the process idiocy

and probably some officious prig will wipe this comment NPA NPA while leaving the infantile changes to the article intact the usual wikipedia hack elevation story  slackers welcomed and coddled good editors slapped on the hand like ignorami for being pissed about the slackers and not pretending were in a group therapy session while thats the policy official or not the materials gonna blow enjoy wikipedia will either restrict access or fail  

please take the time to review this pages history and notice that within two minutes of me leaving the comment above an admin had swooped in also leaving an inappropriate comment on my user page too poetic meanwhile look at the article arent the articles the reason for the superstructure correction to what i wrote above the laziest most worthless editing one can do is NPAlanguage babysitting and controlfreaking wikipedia admin culture is laughably inept this article was hammered all month and did you see admins fretting so not a chance what a disaster this place is nannyboo bureaucrats with jangly key rings im the one who expanded this article from a good stub with the aux help of probably 57 other editors now gone and i not the vandals am being told quite paternalistically to take my comments to the sandbox unreal incompetence did you see the admins jumping in on the RfC i started above not one but say sucks somewhere and theyre falling over one another to g
