Recent edit to Copenhagen
I removed a redlink from a seealso template You undid my removal and changed it from M to m in the link but its still a redlink There really shouldnt be redlinks in seealso templates so unless you intend to start this list I think we should remove it again Figured Id discuss it with you first but if you disagree with this altogether we can talk on the Copenhagen talk page as well  talk  contribs   count  Im watching this page so just reply to me right here
