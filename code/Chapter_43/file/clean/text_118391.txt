This discussion is two years old but I believe a record should be made of my intentions There are FAs like USS Wisconsin BB64 and USS Missouri BB63 that are this long Its wellwritten I believe the article could be cleaned up at its current length or something close to it and achieve FA status Breaking up those huge sections into subsections would be a good starting point
