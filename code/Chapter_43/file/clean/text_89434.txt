Help requested to mediate deletion of article Maurizio Giuliano

Dear Chair

The above article has been the subject of changes and disputes and finally it has been deleted  I was involved in editing the article and I honestly can disclose the fact that I know the subject of the article  But I honestly dont feel that I am biased in favour of the article  though as a lawyer I trust you can better see whether I am indeed objective as I claim to be

To the best of my perception most if not all the changes and the deletion itself saw the involvement of a specific user whom I shall not mention out of courtesy  I was surprised by the objections and changes made by the user but did not object and instead worked with him to solve the issue and improve my own objectivity  We had some useful correspondence and I felt the issue was being addressed informally

PROBLEM Now however the article has been deleted  And I can see on the deletion discussion that there was no consensus at all  One specific user pushed for the deletion and a decision was taken to delete despite many votes to keep  The discussion seems to me very biased against the subject of the article and I note the following

 The objector stated that his status as Guinness record holder is not proven  The subject IS in the Guinness Book of World Records 2006 edition page 126 on the UK edition  I can send a copy of the scanned page by email or upload it as may be requested  I think this already makes him notable  The objector pointed out that some online media cited him as being 23 when he broke the record  He was instead 28 and this is reflected correctly in the Guinness Book and in other media  Some media just got it wrong  I dont see why this should be relevant

 Regarding his books the subject published two books  The objector claimed that these are selfpublished sources  That is true  But there is also plenty of thirdparty materials about his books which you can find online  So he published two books which have been reviewed by others  he is an author  I think this is enough for inclusion

 Finally the strangest thing the objector disputes his notability as a UN official   The issue here is that his status as a UN official was not even mentioned in the article  certainly not until I last saw it   So why did this become a topic for discussion   This makes me almost suspect that there may be a personal element

 Regarding other articles where he is cited  The same user has also deleted his name  among many  from the article on the Centre for Social Studies where there was a sentence stating that the Centres published authors included him  How can this be disputed   There is a book with ISBN etc available on Amazon clearly indicating that he is the author and the Centre is the publisher  This should be sufficient proof of the fact that he is one of the Centres published authors

I hope you can resolve the dispute and my ideal solution would be
 The article is reinstated and you can make any changes to it you deem appropriate
 If there is anything substantial I object to or if I want to add new info I shall contact you or someone you might designate instead of making changes directly
 The one user who keeps objecting to the article should be asked to refrain from making changes directly and instead go via you or someone you might designate

Thanks in advance
