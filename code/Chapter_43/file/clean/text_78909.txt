Re Wrestlecrap 

The guy posting there as Merle Vincent is most likely a vandal even though his recent addition to the page made it sound like accurate information The real Merle Vincent sadly passed away several years ago and it seems that his name is just along the lines of people registering under false names associated with Wrestlecrap to try and get away with vandalism Definitely take anything this poster says with a huge grain of salt Thanks again for the help patrolling the page
