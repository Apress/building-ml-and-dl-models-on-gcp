I added a reference for Jadoubovic although this could still use another reference or two  A magazine reference contemporary with the incident as Bill suggests would be good  This is an extremely wellknown story probably the biggest story at Sousse 1967 other than Fischer dropping out  Unlike many such stories it seems to be true and accurately reported  The WPBLP concerns are wellgrounded however and this really needed a better reference  The article as a whole is still largely unreferenced  The only other ref given is Golombek and Golombek has only a brief entry which does not support most of the claims in the article
