 Italic text and this quote here Ill warn or block any user I see who persists in such comments although I have to say that I rarely have seen such incoherent aggression before this shows me one of two things  1 you are prone to making aggrandizing statements like although I have to say that I rarely have seen such incoherent aggression before which begs the question about what was incoherent about my statement to this person or 2 you are very inexperienced about human interaction  Either way youre probably not the best person to be moderating Wikipedia  I understand Wikipedia being unpaid is facing a crisis in finding competent administrators  Shame since the current administrators seem to be ruining it for everybody  Worse you have failed to read this section that you cite httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaCIVILAssume_good_faith  Now ask yourselftelling an administrator like William who has been voted out by the Wikipedia committee as an administrator due to his censoring activities and apparent bias towards the Global Warming cause as has been exposed in the online mainstream media that he should not censor any of my comments about his censorship about a particular article on the Wiki page that he censoredis clearly good faith  In fact it goes to the very issue of the article under consideration  How is that not good faith  You perhaps were offended by the rhetorical twist the knife remark I made but thats small beer  Nuff said  Im not going to make a mountain out of a molehill but this is another example of why Wikipedia has gone downhill and now is just a shadow of its former self and potential  Have a nice day
