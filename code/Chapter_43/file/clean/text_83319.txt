I dont know what you want me to say to them They seem pretty determined to drag both our names through the mud in their zeal to defend that ass SPUI Doesnt shock me From the day I first interacted with him the guy has had his own little bodyguard squad of admins protecting him just because hes made 50k worth of edits most of them being page moves and redirects however so I dont see what they think hes added to the project But I will try for what its worth As for stalking you there is nothing in the rules Ive seen that says I cant track your user contribs or SPUIs or Rschens like I do I use them as a kind of watch page If someone would like to point me to where that is wrong then please do so otherwise Ill continue to do so as I please
