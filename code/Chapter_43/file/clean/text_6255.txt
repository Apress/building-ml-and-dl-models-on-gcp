I totally agree Griffin is married is a waste of a section If the name of his wife or perhaps more personal info can be added this would be an appropriate section Info from his book may have many things to add but a 3 word sentence warranting a whole section seems a bit too much Put this in the very beginning of the article would be better if more personal info cant be added
