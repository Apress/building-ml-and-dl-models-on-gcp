The free translation of Por la razón o la fuerza loses the spirit of the phrase a better translation of razón would be reason and a much better overall translation would be By means of reason or force or By reason or force Might implies some kind of status over the opponent while the term fuerza must be interpreted as strenght or force of will instead of a superior power
So though By right or might rhymes and sounds cool a much better translation is By reason or force
