Too many generalizations
there are too many generalizations in here Eg a ref has a quote from one or two people working at an ISP was interpreted in the article as the telecommunications industry Or Google Microsoft and Intel support the NBN was interpreted as international technology companies This it totally misleading The smaller telcosISPs support anything that reduces telstras power And global tech companies support anything that will increased demand for their products  as long as they dont have to pay for it Ok to mention it of course but generalize and deduct widespread industry support doesnt reflect true complexity of the situation19214811779
