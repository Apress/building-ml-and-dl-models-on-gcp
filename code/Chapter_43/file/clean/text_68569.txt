Thoughts on references 

I think the references tag is in the wrong place an now that Ive unprotected the article Im going to move it and make some other suggestions  Basically I suggest that any micronation that has its own Wikipedia article does not need a reference in this article since presumably the main article is full of references or else it should be stubbed or deleted but thats another problem  On the other hand micronations which do not have their own article should or must be referenced here or else not listed at all Thatcher131
