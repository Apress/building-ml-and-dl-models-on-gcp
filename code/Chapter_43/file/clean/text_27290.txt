Do you have two minutes 

If so could you please tell me if I did anything wrong here I declined a submission as nonnotable I was on a a phone at that time and I might have erred in doing so  the articles notability was established But I ended up receiving a gross personal attack which made me very upset I tried to stay calm and sort things out with the user If you have two minutes can you please review my actions and see if I have done anything out of line here This is not the first time I have been attacked by someone because I declined their submission musician
