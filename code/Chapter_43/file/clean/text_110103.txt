Better to continue the discussion here I think

The ANI in which we both participated was closed out in June or so with no action based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems shed occasioned and a promise to try to stop  Youll recall that she had been removing references from articles to nonChristian religions and thought sexual orientation and sex generally among other things and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits

As the matter wrapped up I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem she described it along the lines of offending one or two users or that shed actually quit the problematic editing but after being characterized as overzealous on the point I withdrew

She has slowed but certainly not quit her POV editing  A partial list of such edits since then includes

July 9
At Christianity without explanation she recast the Criticism and apologetics section as Arguments and apologetics and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians as well as a sourced observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth

July 30
At TroisRivi√®res removed without explanation the identification of a Canadian Liberal Party politician as liberal as well as a reference to another persons being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased without comment mention of Hugh Hefners attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known and described as an LGBT activist

October 15
At Ted Turner she removed a reliablysourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic claiming it was contradicted by info elsewhere in article when the excised information was more recent than the contradictory text and indeed nicely illustrated the point in the source itself which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned  see this Talk page entry from September

I agree that the party school edit to the University of Wisconsin is in the larger picture kind of a silly thing but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from she has made the same edit at least four times now  see May 15 June 13 October 3 in addition to todays  And to be clear shes not removing the party school material but just the perfectly good citation to Playboy  Indeed in her October 3 entry she updated the party school rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboys stead

So I take your point that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on but she has continued her practice albeit slowed of idiosyncratic unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view  I dont think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment and thats what I did
