Thanks so much for removing While I dont have 500 edits I have been an AfC participant before the 500 minimum was there use three different professional and personal user names and have teach a university class on Wikipedia article creation and editing so that my last 40 students have over 2000 edits under my supervision Since those do not accrue to my user name they dont matter to some Perhaps we have a different perspective on roles and how criteria should be applied I would welcome you and others who spend time removing AfC participants to spend some time  actually clearing the AfC backlog
