Well exactly the point ive been making you show NO interest in articles until ive contributed to them  As soon as I do youre all over them like a rash rearranging editing here and there then spamming me with line after line of pointless drivel all to no valid contribution  Its just a Harassment  Baiting campaign  Aided and abetted with hacks of the edit summary of articles to remove evidence of your contributions

As for your PhD in History and knowledge of the period where is the evidence of knowledge of the period  If you know so much why hadnt you actually updated or looked at the articles in all the time of your membership  Im sorry it doesnt fly Damac  Any serious knowledge of the period would be noted via your contributions because a number of the articles on the period contain glaring inaccuracies  

What I have seen is very little knowledge but a large amount of readiness to harass and distract a serious contributor  Your efforts not culminating in an attempt to have him removed because he knows more on the subject than you do  Please grow up end your hacking and end your nonsense about qualifications on here the only qualification worth having is being aware of the facts
