Well the problem is that our articles arent supposed to give advice to anyone per se Looking at your contributions to the article Road traffic safety they read more like a stepbystep howto manual than an encyclopedia article  What I would recommend for you to do is this try writing an article about this in your own userspace first  You can do this by  creating the page and using it for your article  Try to focus on capturing an encyclopedic style avoid stepbystep instructions dont use first and secondperson pronouns I you we etc try to be descriptive rather than prescriptive  Try to find some good reliable sources on this subject use what they say in your article without using their words to say it  Since this is a userspace draft you have all the time you need to work on it so take your time  When you think youre done you can submit your article to articles for creation where you can get some feedback on it before it goes live  If all goes well and the AFC reviewer approves itll become a real article Let me know if you think I can help with this Id be happy to lend what few skills I have
