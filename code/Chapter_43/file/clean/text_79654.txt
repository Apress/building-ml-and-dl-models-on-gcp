Plot synopsis contradiction Candy shot dead Candy shot and recovers 

I dont know the film though Id like to see it  I read a reference to the movie in an online article and came to the Wikipedia article to learn more

I found a messy unresolved redundant description and a contradiction in the contributions made probably by different contributors in the third and fourth paragraphs from the end of the Plot synopsis

Maybe someone can synthesize the info and correct the factual discrepancy involved
