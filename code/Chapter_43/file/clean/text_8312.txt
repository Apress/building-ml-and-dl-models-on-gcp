Ralf Reski may meet the criteria but if he does there is no evidence of that in the article If he indeed does meet the criteria please add the evidence for this to the article While it is true that these are just guidelines and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made Im not trying to prove that he isnt notable Im trying to determine if he is
As far as I can see the criteria are not met
1 The persons research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline broadly construed as demonstrated by independent reliable sources
Im not a fan of citation metrics and theyre not the final word but the hindex is 30 which is pretty average The most cited paper does have over 300 citations but thats the moss genome sequence where hes one of many authors Genome sequences always get lots of citations
2 The person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level
This may be true but the article does not mention it I dont think a Heisenberg fellowship counts as highly prestigious
3 The person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association eg a National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society or a Fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor eg the IEEE
Again this may be true but isnt mentioned in the article
4 The persons academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education affecting a substantial number of academic institutions
No major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article
5 The person holds or has held a named chair appointment or Distinguished Professor appointment at a major institution of higher education and research
No evidence for this is given in the article
6 The person has held a major highestlevel elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society
From what I can see in the article the highest position he has held was dean of the Faculty of Biology
7 The person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity
No evidence for this given in the article
8 The person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major wellestablished academic journal in their subject area
Only normal editorial board memberships given in the article
9 The person is in a field of literature eg writer or poet or the fine arts eg musician composer artist and meets the standards for notability in that art such as WPCREATIVE or WPMUSIC
Does not apply
If you can show that the criteria are met after all Im happy to go along with it but just being a professor does not satisfy WPPROF Cheers
