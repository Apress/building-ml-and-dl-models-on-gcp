There is no WPRS to affirm the veracity of DIs doubtful claim either  That is you have no WPRS either way  Therefore it is not a verifiable fact that Picard or any of the other 103 original signers consented to or agreed with the DIs published interpretation or political position visavis PBS or any other subsequent political purpose regarding what should or shouldnt be taught in school

All you have on verifiable record is that the 103 original signers called for skeptical examination of the evidence for scientific theories  DIs unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of Wikipedia  

All the rest of DIs propaganda is utter hogwash fraudulently perpetrated by the DI without the verifiably demonstrated consent of the original 103 individuals

In view of the WPBLP Do No Harm clause the unverified claim of the DI must not be promoted to fact and any content to that effect must be immediately expunged per the WPBLP
