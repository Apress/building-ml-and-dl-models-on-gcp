I read NPOV and it says presenting all sides of a view You are in error From WPNPOVAll Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view representing fairly and as far as possible without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources Glenn Beck does not in and of himself represent a significant point of view and he is certainly not a WPRS when it comes to information about Van Jones and ACORN Especially when it comes to the ACORN stuff the part of WPNPOV youre neglecting is that the POV needs to be properly published by reliable sources Furthermore WPWEIGHT instructs us to give weight to these points of view according to their prominence in reliable sources Thus when you post blogs links to Becks own website web polls etc You are still not providing reliable sources Cptnono presented us with sources like the NY times and The Washington Post and I was immediately willing to work on the section with him We are in no way ignoring Becks POV here but the idea of him leading the criticism of Jones is an opinion and per WPRS must be directly attributed to its owner    Â tlk
