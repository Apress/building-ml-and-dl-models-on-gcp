Tip 

When the bot tells you that a vandal is a school IP that should usually set alarm bells ringing Considering its probably some teenager on his lunch break warning them probably isnt very productive  Personally I think all school IPs should be blocked a son as theyre identified as such since theyre ususally pretty static and they bring nothing but vandalism but then I also think logging in should be compulsory so perhaps Im just a pessimist    Penny for your thoughts
