Good News Translation Thanks 

Thanks for moving to the top the renaming of the Good News Translation in 2001 When I was researching the rewrite for the article it amazed me that there was so much confusion as to the name of the version Zondervan appears to have switched names the Bible Society still seems confused If you see one it still has GNBTEV on the cover and on the title page  Thanks hie
