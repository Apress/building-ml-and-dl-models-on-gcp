I strongly disagree whith your opinion but since Im clearly outnumbered Ill accept your decision in my opinion the most information its removed the least useful this article becomes the only opening year isnt really relevant if its taken individually  and despite being stable data theyre alike questionable at least for early systems  and this way even the sortability of the table   becomes pointless itll be more rational to revert the article to a mere simple list as it was before March 2013 if I correctly saw in the history Conversely the readers usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwidecontinental list if youre interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial Wiki pages while if you aim to a world overview its somewhat tiring to search open  match a handful of different article Dont take it to heart but I dont intend to further contribute to this list good luck with your project but from my personal point of view as readeruser it doesnt worth the needed time and effort
