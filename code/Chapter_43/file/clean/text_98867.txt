I find it quite bizarre to learn that my vote on a subject was discounted because I didnt use some arcane piece of wikimarkup May I remind you of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaBUREAUWikipedia_is_not_a_bureaucracy  I have been editing wikipedia since 2004 and I have never heard of vote I guess Ill be told off it I dont assume good faith but that leaves little else to assume other than obtuse daftness
