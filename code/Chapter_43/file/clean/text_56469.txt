sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits

I don know why but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation I have asked a sysop UserShii to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago

About 15 kilobytes 37 of the then total including 2 large subsections kept on being deleted by an apparent UserNq0x77 One of the subsections Other designations has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion  editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters but this was apparently resolved When I tried Nq0x77s page to ask why there wasnt one No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page Ive restored the article to the version left by UserCubs197 earlier today and you restored a further revert The article has or hadreached B class status and is rated as topimportance so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion and I couldnt do this because UserNq0x77 doesnt seem to be available

 UserShii wrote to me just blocked the sockpuppet instead  tock  and I have just replied Thank you very much but sadly I think the same person is at it again this time using a new and different sockpuppet User Pednursing  who has just made the same 15kb deletion Would semiprotect status stop this or at least make it harder for himherit

 Bikram Yoga 

Hi Jusdafax I see you used Huggle to revert some edits to Bikram Yoga by a particular anonymous editor However for some reason your Huggle did not place warnings on the anons talk page Now there are some more edits by himher that I want to revert only I would like them to escalate from yours Hmmm  Maybe your Huggle needs a tuneup ie reconfiguration Thanks   SpikeToronto  

PS If theres a reponse please respond here to keep the thread together I will have your talk page watchlisted Thanks   SpikeToronto
