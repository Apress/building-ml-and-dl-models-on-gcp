Thanks for guidance 

Thanks for your guidance on the deletion of the first couple of posts i understand the point about copywrite but wanted to understand some more about why they were deleted i thought a good place to start would be some of the top business people operating in China and these were not considered worthy perhaps there was not enough supporting evidence as to why they are worthy can you outline what is suitable for corroborating information links to youtube clips of them talking on tv newspaper articles books they have written conferences they have spoken at  i created my postings using existing postings as templates and was therefore surprised to see that they were deleted 
thanks
