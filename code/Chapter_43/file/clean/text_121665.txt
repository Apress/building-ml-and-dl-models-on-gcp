Discussing summarizationdeletion 

Hi Babakathy I opened a discussion at TalkFrance about the articles size just as you had suggested me but it has been pretty much ignored it didnt draw any kind of comments so far not even negative ones This was somewhat expected so Im considering the possibility of going ahead with the summarization even though the discussion isnt going anywhere because the alternative seems to be doing nothing at all again If you want to leave a few commentssuggestions on how to work on that article to get it to an acceptable size that would be great Cheers
