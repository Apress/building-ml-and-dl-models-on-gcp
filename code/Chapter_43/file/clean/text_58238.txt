EDIT The statement can be removed just on the basis that it adds no value to the article by making it even more biased towards enabling the Holocaust all over wikipedia It assumes that  Leuchter doesnt know the amounts of cyanide needed to kill and it assumes that Leuchter tried to disprove the gas chambers through ignoring the facts Both of these without any proof that thats actually the case 

Also even if that was the case  what does tended to confirm it mean Even safe amounts of gas found by any interested parties would tend to confirm that gassings took place so its irrelevant

In general the whole article is focused on disproving the Leuchter report instead of displaying the Leutcher report  thats why it needs to be rewritten
