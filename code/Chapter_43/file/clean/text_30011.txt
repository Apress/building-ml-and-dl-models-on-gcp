are not considered to be reliable sources fully agreed But no one not me at least is talking about using wikiislam as a reliable source per se The subject was criticism of Islam and I was redirecting readers where they might get more knowledge about the subject I am rather interested in the credibility of the protocol of the website Wikiislam was referred to as a reliable website and not intrinsically as a SOURCE It has very reliable sources just as you mentioned  booksmostly QURANIC VERSES HADITHS tafsirs and very nominal amount of personal opinion less than what some of the articles of wikipedia have
I am more than happy to argue with you regarding wikiislams credibility BUT PLEASE DONT FEED ME THIS NONSENSE THAT WIKIISLAM IS NOT RELIABLE OR NOTABLE simply because it says something thats considered to be politically incorrect Learn a little something here WIKIISLAM LIKE WIKIPEDIA is just a conveyor of information through reputed sources Try to comprehend my point Im not so eloquent a personBarry
