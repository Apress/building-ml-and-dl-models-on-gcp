Nationalists 

First of all this is not a place for your pro terrorist nazi separatist propaganda Kosovans dont and never existed if you mean Serbians in Southern Serbia Kosovo then yes Anyway article claims Guard is formed of nationalists Serbian nationalists and Serbian nationalist parties together with Serbian nationalist organization absolutely dont support this organization and claim that all military actions should be made by Serbian army that unlike Guard who had only 11000 members has 300000 members including volunteer Serbian PVO and SAF paramilitary professionals and reserve Serbian nationalist organizations like Наши 1389 Српске Двери Србија до Токија Српски Националисти etc also support that all actions in South Serbia Kosovo should be done by Serbian army So I dont think we should put nationalist but I still wont remove it
