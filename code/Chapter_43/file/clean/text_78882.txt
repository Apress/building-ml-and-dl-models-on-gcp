Numbers killled 

The existing text matches is similar to that used for 911 which is 2973 victims and the 19 hijackers died as a result of the attacks  I would support a change to that form of words but do not support the were killed by the bombers that SlaterStephen has sought to introduce  If the sourced number is 56 not 52 then change the number that is a different issue   TALK
