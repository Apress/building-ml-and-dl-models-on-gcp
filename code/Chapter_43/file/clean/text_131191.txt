And in future if I ask someone here a question then they answer it that does not then need you to poke in to what is essentially a conversation betweeen those two parties  No one here needs you directing the conversation  If you want to do that go to a speech therapy site somewhere  You are just trying to cause further trouble here when you are not even from this area as a contributor so not a reg here and I understand are not even from NSW  You are acting like an interferring parent who gets between two kids referring and that never works and certainly never leads to peace
