I agree with Kamosuke on some points however I still prefer Sir Edgars version over Kamosukes although not perfect  I request Sir Edgars version to be modified to mention Western influence before and under the sakoku policy
Here are my thoughts in detail  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire with respect to culture politics literature arts and religion as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations  More specifically Luoyang 洛陽 and Changan 長安 are similar to Ancient Rome  However you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan until the fall of Baekje Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries  However after Japan is discovered by Europe Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence
Let me stress that Sir Edgars wording is more elegant and beautiful  However it needs a little more detail particularly regarding Western influence before and under the sakoku policy
