Choice is always good I cannae say much else for Im a candidate and I know not what might deeds you have committed to honor us on the plains of battle but dropping the Viking parlance now More candidates means more choice and more potential opinions and backgrounds to compose the ArbCom If youve got the time and think youd be able to handle it screw ye courage to the sticking place  talk

Copyvios on MP again

Gday SandyGeorgia I thought you might be interested that I pulled an article from the main page today TITN that was a copyvio from start to finish 2010 Colombia floods It had been up for days and the copyvios were then when it was posted Ive been on wikibreak for a while so I havent been able to follow what happened with the big plagiarism on the main page discussion I thought you might be interested as I recall you were one of the main drivers of that discussion If its still ongoing Id be happy to join in Ive written a little rantessay on the bottom of my userpage about my frustrations with the lack of main page scrutiny  
 Hi Mk Ive also taken a few days off and am eversoslowly catching up starting at the bottom of the page is as good a place as any  I actually did not intend to become a main driver of the plagiarism discussion nor did I intend to become Plagiarism Central but alas and alack so it has turned out   What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the reward culture on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed illprepared RFA candidates and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has  Anyway I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1 slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki 2 much more work for our few qualified copyvio people 3 little change that Ive been able to detect at DYK or ITN but I dont follow closely enough 4 circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs and 5 curiously even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle   On the copyvio you detected above Im not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people you dont allow them to 1 look for other copyvios by the same author 2 educate that author and 3 remove the copyvio from article history  You might want to go through those steps as well   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny I spose it will take time a few more debacles and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously   Talk
