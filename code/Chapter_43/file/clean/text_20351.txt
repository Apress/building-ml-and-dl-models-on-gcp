Hatting 

Could you please reply on my talk page 

a I have posted the comment not as a personal testimony perse but per WPBIAS that is recognized by the Wikipedia I have posted in a Good Faith without a purpose of having discussion upon it so NOTFORUM doesnt apply here I have posted in order to induce positive improvement of the article

b There were many comments of people without any specific proposition to change the article none of them were hatted It would be highly unusual for impartial observer to understand why that specific post is being hatted

Please reconsider hatting based on the raised points thank you
