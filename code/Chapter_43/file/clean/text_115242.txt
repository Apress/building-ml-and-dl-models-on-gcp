So you are now arguing that its the paper that the money could theoretically be printed on or the magnetic flux patterns on a computers disk or the ink on the central banks ledger that means its not created out of nothing I suggest if you want to see the sort of confusion people are having you look in Archive 1 at   comments in fact Im going to put the comment here This is from someone who is an editor of the QE page and declares they have a BS Economics 2006 MA Applied Economics 2008 and work as Investment Analyst at 60B institutional fund  Banks started to hold excess reserves after Lehman collapse essentially as a response to the central bank liquidity measures at the time That is where the money 600B came from primary dealers gave it to the central bankfed Myself and other people have posted several authoritative references to the actual mechanics of QE yet you still insist that youre correct because you read it in a BBC news article Again there is no money created out of thin air to fund the fed purchases Its been proved over and over
Flux patterns on computer disk are in no way tangible assets that can be constituted as not nothing in this context
