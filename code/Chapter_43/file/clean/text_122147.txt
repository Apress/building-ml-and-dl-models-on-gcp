GA review of Kittis Hognosed Bat 

Thank you for your time reviewing the article so far I was hoping you could give your quick input on the following two things
I tried expanding the lead a bit but now the problem Im running into is that its hard to summarize each section of the article without simply repeating information that appears later I suppose this is a consequence of the article being short to begin with Any advice
Concerning your comment about drifting between singular and plural language Im not sure how to avoid this more than I already have I tried to use singular Kittis Hognosed Bat the bat or it wherever possible but in some cases I felt it was necessary to instead use plural for nouns like colonies and populations

Again thanks for your help talk
