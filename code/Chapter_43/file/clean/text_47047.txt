Ive seen that threat at the start of DVDs with no distinction made between uploads and downloads  It may very well be that they only prosecute uploads but Im also opposed to having overly strict laws and leaving it up to the authorities to decide who to prosecute as this gives them too much power over us  I think I will add this to the list
