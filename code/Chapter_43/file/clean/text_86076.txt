Grandmaster take a look at your own source at the Shah Ismail page  you obviously tried to provide a  source that says Azeris are turks but the source does not once mention that Azeris are turks neither did it have anything to do with Shah ismail Now if you want to be taken serious here i suggest you cite your own serious source first
