In response to your latest comment on my Talk Page however enthusiastic I was in choosingdefending the choice of Indonesian Civil War does not make you any less able to propose a change

Nevertheless I knew that the choice was going to raise some hackles from any number of sides  so there are a good number of redirects to Indonesian Civil War including G30S and G30S PKI as far as I know the most commonly used name for the time periodconflict

If there are other suggestions then Id like to hear them But I do find it a personal annoyance to be criticized for trying to do something without any particular guidance as to what the alternatives may be
