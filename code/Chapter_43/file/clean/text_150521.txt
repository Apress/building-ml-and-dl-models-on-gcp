ProtoIndoEuropean PIE notation as qualified linguists themselves recognize it 

Youre obviously confused between phonetics as found in the study of say modern languages and the proper representation of sounds in protolanguages PIE notation is not necessarily representative of actual pronunciation and PIEists are clear to make that point in many many primers on the topic Try for example IndoEuropean Language and Culture by Fortson Notice how on page 51 which I kindly linked for you in this text there is absolutely no use of your imaginary notation So get off your egotistical knowitall high horse read a book and bite the bullet that youre just plain ignorant of basic comparative linguistics which is all too typical on the childrenmaintained Wikipedia Thanks for your inevitable cooperation in advance May you have more interest in learning than fruitless editing
