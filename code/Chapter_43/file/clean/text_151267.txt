Geology of Antarctica 

As requested by yourself I have done my best to write a decent geology section for the Antarctica article  I felt that the article was a beautiful piece of work but I also completely agreed with your objection  Rather than object I simply wrote something to meet the need  However Im a chemist rather than a geologist and Id really appreciate it if you could read over my efforts at translating into plain English things like the structural grain defined by foldaxis trends has been disrupted by largescale blockfaulting  Hopefully you can accept this article as an FA now Please let me know if its OK Cheers
