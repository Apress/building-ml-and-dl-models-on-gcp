Tbma own original research 

First Tbma only a few days after calling this whole article a hoax has fund a new sources to breakdown this article to crap

First he claims the Soviet had preplanned its withdraw from the front but Finnish sources who is supported by POW interview intellegnce data and Otho Manninen extended archives research in SOvietRussian archives have pinpointed exactlly witch Soviet units where pressent in the battle and when they left

What we now for certaint is The composistion of the Soviet major combat formations where pressent they Soviet was reinforced by 100 tanks and SPG before the battle and during the battle 21 Soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle 

This contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only 60000 Soviet red army men

What about Tbma sources

The Sources of 60000 men from Punaiset panssarit  Punaarmeijan panssarijoukot 19181945 is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank and just uses a few phrases on the TaliIhantala battle
