A couple of explanations 

Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively and to clarify a couple of things

1 I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers I dint expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance

2 These contributions were based on my deep knowledge in my opinion and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind

3 I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism

 My suggestion lets write what Silesia is now 

The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users The current restored and protected version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge if its not changed as soon as possible

1 First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now as this is most interesting to the reader and not what is was in the past Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section

2 It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river

3 Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia It is a historical part of Lusatia and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816

4 Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph but we decide to it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation

5 I do not care in what order the languagenames of Silesia are mentioned but I do insist that the Silesian version Ślónsk Ślunsk is included in this list 

6 I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least the Silesians the Poles the Germans the Czechs

7 The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts The passages need some minor rewrite

8 The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false no longer upheld by the German historians and must be removed

9 Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words

10 The Silesia article need more sections on the People Economy Culture Education Science and Tourism
