Well let me say this once again and please address this issue I was editing already existing references that is links to my website that were placed there by other people You keep claiming that I am adding links when I am not adding links In the editing I did this weekend I did not add a single link

Are you telling me that if I see an improperly formatted reference to one of my webpages that I cant fix it I have found errors in the page title name of author name of website and year Why is it wrong to fix such things
