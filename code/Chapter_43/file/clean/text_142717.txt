martyr does not have a specific meaning in religions in every religion it means to die protecting what God said now the fact that there are different religions this is another subject

Same goes for you you should read my stuff and discuss before you undo everything i wrote  four of you undoed what i did one guy did it four times   you are not better than me just because there are four of you and you have a status of an editor  

The fact that secular people are using this word is kind of like saying the secular people use word God and change the meaning of if and say it means something else  Now if you want to add secular definitions of God such as he does not exist or secular sections to word martyr which means someone is a martyr that dies for his soccer team feel free if you have no fear of God   just because you call someone a martyr cuz he gave his life for a country doesnt make him a martyr  he is not  

SOLUTION

this page needs to be split into religios and secular then lets see how many secular things can be written about the word

U talk about this word about what other people use this word for  you really dont know what the word means  

there is a difference being a real martyr in the after life  vs a martyr hero in this life after you are dead or a fake one a lie not true one i dont know how else to explain it  does the truth mean anything to you or is the intention of wikipedias staff to confuse to world
