KUCI
Whats your interest in KUCI  
I cant stand commercial radio so I stream noncommercial radio at work I discovered KUCI after giving up trying to find something good on KCSB Now I stream it just about daily I like the Blues disease currently streaming the Zydeco show and Uptown Top Ranking The SalsaMerengue show is decent when the DJs shut up and play the music although Reggaeton has been creeping into their playlist Are you a listener

 Sigüenza y Góngora 

Hi Rockero thanks for all the work on the Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora article Interesting material and Id never seen it before

I have one minor question Was his father really born in America I knew Carlos was but I had assumed his father was from Spain because of the royal tutoring

 
The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace but a Continental birth is much more likely given the timeframe and his position I changed it to peninsular only to discover the deficiencies in that article
I presume you are referring to S y Gs theories about the origin of the Olmecs and the evangelization of Thomas when you say you found the new material interesting Such theories were actually quite common and it appears that SyG was one of the first to come up with them or maybe just the first to popularize them The Mormons were way behind 8
One final note Im guessing that book examiner is your translation of corregidor general Is this correct My Englishlanguage sources make use of the term censor which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general I have added Censor Catholic Church to the censor dab page in hopes of composing an article on the post but refrained from linking it from the SyG article If I am in error please correct me Thanks for your comments and the pic looks great  
Yes if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general but Im away from my encylopedias now and cant definitely verify that Im sure I can find a copy of Enciclopedia de México in a library here Im in Los Angeles now but it may be a little while before I get to that Book examiner wasnt really my translation I had no idea what the original term meant but I found him referred to as book examiner on a web page and I identified the two I think its safe to assume all three terms refer to the same office
