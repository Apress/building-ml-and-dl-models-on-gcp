Blatant advertising on Allscripts 

My intent is a scholarly and workmanlike entry with a neutral point of view and verification The articles internal and external references support notability Id like to try again paying close attention to requirements Ill remove the unfulfilled table of content entries that appear to simply be advertising for products 

How do I gain access to do this Your guidance is appreciated
