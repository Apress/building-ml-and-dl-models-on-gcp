It is relatively relavent I say that because the group using the term Gospel Halls for their buildings does not consider themselves to be part of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren for that matter but they are very similar If you can find a copy of it probably cant but its worth a try read Norman Crawfords Assembly History Its a very short book on the beliefs and history of the gospel hall assemblies in America Canada and the UK I believe our particular branch began in Scotland seperately from the Plymouth Brethren branch but it was at the same time  0102 24 October
