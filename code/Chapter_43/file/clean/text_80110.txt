Thanks for replying so fast 
  Look I understand that Wikipedia doesnt try to add to knowledge and only reports on what already exists I brought up all of my little scenarios about being a preacher or author or internet essayist to prove a common point its not like an idea has to be written down to exist
  I just wrote a lengthy counter argument but then realized that I was essentially restating what I had said before and so the whole thing would be of no aid
  Let me just say this you think that my interpretations arent commonsense but I do both make absolute perfect sense but youre just sitting there right now like uh no I mean angel means messenger so how is it impossible that some Biblical passages concerning angels arent actually speaking about human messengers Tell me Prove me wrong If angel means messenger then how can it perhaps not sometimes be referring to human messengers Say something better than the onus is on you because the argument is airtight I already proved it If I didnt then simply say what is illogical in my reasoning I think that my contributions were blocked mostly because you dont agree with me
  And I think Wikipedias sourcing policy is illogical I know that if I were to write a book with my opinions in it and then quote it on Wikipedia saying page 10 of John Smiths book says it would not be blocked because it is 100 true that my book would have those contents But if I type something here then it is original research and is therefor invalid Well either way Im the source of the material
