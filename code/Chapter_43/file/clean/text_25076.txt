I think that picking at the word team is a little excessive Wiktionary defines team as any group of people involved in the same activity So the word team doesnt imply any level of organization at all Also the word international isnt describing anything more glorious than the fact that all the people are from differant nationsIn Wiktionary Of or having to do with more than one nation Just because it sounds more impressive than saying we got guys from all over doesnt mean its false or has to be edited out I dont know about using the title archeologist though So I wwould have to say that a french and american coming to your yard to investigate are an international team assuming they work together in some way
