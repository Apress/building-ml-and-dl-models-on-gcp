Main points AGAINST this article RfC
Information that shows irregularities tendentious editing vandalism and POV on this article should written here
I will start from what looks to be the main problem 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article So the first sentence of the article Albanian nationalism also known as Albanianism12345 or PanAlbanianism67 refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania 19451991 its continuation into modern Albania as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land ofthe Dardanians and thus a recreation of their ancient kingdom is a POV Here are references that beg to differ One Two Three and Four For more read Kosovo

Lets start from these two issues
