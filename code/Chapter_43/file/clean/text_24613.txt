History

The Valley Press was founded by AJ Hicks on Saturday April 3 1915 as the Palmdale Post At the time the Valley was home to about 3500 people Over the decades of the 20th century the newspaper changed hands and there were a few name changes as well On May 4 1950 the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press

On July 1 1958 four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families Arthur F Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958 with Ralph and his brother Maurice W Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr as secretarytreasurer Ralph H Markham bought out Maurice W Markham and Lamont Odett Sr bought out Arthur F Folz on April 1 1961 to create the partnership of Ralph H Markham and Lamont Odett Sr In October 1975 Lamont Odett Sr died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr became copublishers On March 1 1981 William C Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director William C Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H Markhams death in November 1985

The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994 William C Markham is president and publisher The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont Monty Odett Sr running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun Now The Yuma Sun with Williams new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma Arizona When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935 the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale

The paper later dropped the South from its nameplate and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted The Tuesday edition was added in 1969 followed by Friday 1982 and Wednesday 1988 Saturday 1992 and finally the Monday edition in 1998 making the Antelope Valley Press a fullfledged daily newspaper  perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery The paper remains in family hands and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership
Technology and editorial outlook

The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peachcolored newsprint while under the OdettMarkham family ownership The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color

The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by years end
