Hi Parutakupiu theres no disturbance  Sorry for not replying on the WikiProject page  sometimes I have an immediate opinion on a topic and I will reply quickly and sometimes I need to think about something so I take some time

In this case I guess Im not sure about your proposal  The templates certainly look good so theres no issue there but Im weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes  I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic and other places where navigation boxes really are desired  For example many athlete pages have an excessive use of navigation boxes in my opinion  Take a look at Toni Sailer for example  At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the showhide feature  that page was very cluttered before  Even so Im not sure that it is a natural way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia  Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next  Wouldnt it be just as easy to have a See also section with links to List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing and List of Alpine Skiing World Champions and navigate from there

Its not exactly a parallel situation but perhaps the concept is similar  the question to be answered is do we really need this new set of navigation boxes which will number around 350400 if we make them for all events or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient  I currently dont have a solid opinion on this myself so I havent offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page  However if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across all events not just diving then I would support you either way  Consistency is my biggest concern here  Hope this helps
