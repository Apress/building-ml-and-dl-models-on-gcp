Glaring evidentiary deficiency not reported herein wrt George Zimmermans account of events 

Recent photos of Zimmerman shortly after the shooting made by the police show no blood spatter on his front including his shirt  His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martins front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmermans account  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmermans story should be noted in this wiki article  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing off the ground from a lying down position status after Martins struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated  By leaving these facts out of the article it suggests that wiki authors are suspedning the laws of gravity and common sense  BTW who locked the article down from further editing  The holier than thousuperior to the rest of us wiki editor police
