NC Council of State election returns 

Ive looked at so many sources that Ive forgotten where I pulled the election returns from I believe it was the NC Board of Elections website and I believe it was today however a recount is in progress the returns may fluctuate and Im sure that the final numbers will be different from what they are now Feel free to update them of course    0534 16 Nov 2004 UTC
