The third paragraph says Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse This is a substantive error

Courthouse as one word refers to the actual court house in a village or town The surrender actually occurred at the McLean house it was purposefully not done in the actual Court House so as to avoid giving it a legal imprimatur  formally recognizing the confederacy which the union never did

The correct text should read Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 1865 It is correctly spelled later in the article general in cheif section 2nd para
