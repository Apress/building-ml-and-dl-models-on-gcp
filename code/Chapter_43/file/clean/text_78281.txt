I dont have a lot of experience in this subject but I think a separate article for Muslim respect towards Jews might be OK It will be imporatant to cite sources and maintain a neutral point of view especially since youre dealing with a contentious subject If you do create a new article it can be linked from the See also section of the Islam and AntiSemitism article Another  possible solution would be to move Islam and AntiSemitism to Muslim Attitudes towards Jews or something similar which would be broad enough to include a section about Muslim respect towards Jews Of course you should seek consensus on the articles talk page before making such a major change to the title
