Jehovahs Witnesses Related Question 

Hi Jeffro

I dont remember ever actually writing any Wikipedia comments before so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky I was just looking for lists of Watchtower Publications to help me with my collection when I stumbled across this page and section 

httpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publicationsPrimary_study_aids

httpsenwikipediaorgwikiTalkList_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publicationsStudy_aids

The heading These publications are intended to convert interested individuals struck me as a bit jarring and out of place For one the immediate next header is Secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism so it is not even consistent Secondly I am not sure that I agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header as it includes original research private interpretation of primary sources and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed eg how does a 1980s Kingdom Ministry support the statement that Studies in the Scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals Thirdly and lastly making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred  

With that in mind a possible alternative header might be something like

These publications are generally considered prior to baptism 

It is concise clear consistent with the other headers and doesnt make assumptions about intent only fact May I have your thoughts   
You have previously commented at Wikipedia Talk pages and you had mastered Wikiformatting such as indenting at the time You also referred to yourself in the third person a few times I hope youve recovered from that oddity
The intended purpose of the Bible study program offered by Jehovahs Witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the JW faith though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study For example
Your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth qualify as an unbaptized publisher and become a dedicated and baptized Witness of JehovahOur Kingdom Ministry April 2001 page 5
Chapter 18 of What Does the Bible Really Teach pages 174183
Your alternative wording would therefore be misleading because the students dont start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religionthey just think theyre learning more about the Bible Your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a a person wants to be baptised as a JW b they study the necessary literature c they get baptised  
I have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals
