Im guessing youre talking about WikipediaARBMAC2Establishing_consensus_on_names if not please advise The opening of the discussion should ideally be done by the community not arbcom Arbcom will appoint the panel of uninvolved admins towards the end The discussion could be in several forums but my personal suggestion is RFC Whatever form it takes if you want to initiate it thatd be fine Ive put a note in my Outlook calendar to remind to seek out admins for the panel before the discussion closes    Talk
