User troy has deliberately erased a comment made by me on the discussion page of pope shenouda Therefore he is in breach with wikipedia policy and should be reminded not to erase comments he feels is an insult to him 7724818598  

And he may also be reminded that this is not a religious website and certainly not the religious website of the patriarchate of alexandria and these vandalistic removing acts should be condemned in this encyclopedia where everyone has a right to express his opinion on discussion pages regarding issues 7724818598
