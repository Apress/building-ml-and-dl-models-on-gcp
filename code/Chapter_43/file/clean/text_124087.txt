About the Critique 

The following sandbox version of what I intend to be either a new segment of the Friedmann Equations FE or of the FLRW Metric has the working title Critique of the Universe since it is a critical review of the FEFLRW standard model of cosmology It may be able to stand alone with a title like The FLRW Metric Friedmann Equations Hubble Acceleration and Dark Energy  a Critique Anyway after it has had a few rounds of editing by interested Wikieditors It will certainly look a lot different This is only an initial position but the general outline and the tone will survive The title may change however
