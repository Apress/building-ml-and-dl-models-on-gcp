Also I think alot of people need some sorta historychecklist on all the sets especially older players like myself Ive played since the original set was out and its hard to find a GOOD checklist on the internet at least one that tells everything about everything from all the way back and includes all error and promo info too And dont lay some crap on me that the more recent sets have a bigger importance Also I swear I saw a whole page about the Base Set not to long ago Did one of you delete that Why might I ask did you delete that If you tell me its just taking up space well I think theres thousands of pages on wikipedia like that If someone trys to delete one of the new pages i will make ill be more than happy to get some admins on here to sort out your opinions on this The bottom line is that there should be some sort of detailed database that emcompasses ALL pokemon cards in ENGLISH that have been made You cant find one of those on the internet today so why not have one on wikipedia i ask you And who are you to decide what is appropriate for wikipedia anyway hows this raw source material anyway Look at any band or comic page Thats alot of info isnt it Also I dont want to start a whole site I think wikipedia serves that purpose already for alot of reasons
