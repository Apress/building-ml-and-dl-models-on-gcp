Present Day Canada Government website incorrectly Titles BNA Act 1867

The Government of Canada mainly Liberal since 1963 is very skilled at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below

British North America Act 1867

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867 which is a misnomer and a shameful one indeed

2  As enacted by the Constitution Act 1982 which came into force on April 17 1982 The section as originally enacted read as follows 
1 This Act may be cited as The British North America Act 1867 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation  Youre reading a footnote which merely says that originally the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867  But under the law since 1982 it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed  Judicial decisions and subsequent legislation use this new naming system  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a constitutition when originally created since Canada had no consitution until 1982  Collectively these acts were turned into a constitution and hence renamed   

What
Canada had no Constitution until 1982

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive renaming that is not what happened at all  Please get your facts straight
