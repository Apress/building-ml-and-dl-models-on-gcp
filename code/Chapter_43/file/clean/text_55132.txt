Oh boy  the Julie Walters revert was a mistake I do not think it was a disaster though On the subject of warning users I do not think that warning an IP user hours after the event is worth bothering about especially if they have not made many edits  If there is vandalism there is no requirement to make any comment so I will not always do so  On the whole I think you will agree that my reversions are generally right with the odd slipup now and again It must run in the family here as with my resident delinquent who will not be able to access my account now  Â Chat
