fair enough

its a fair point but why oh why did i do so much fulfilling all of the wikpedia guidlines for personal content  editting style  correct sourcing and referencing  wiki formatting etc months tireless work on an article which was to be so casually consigned to the dustbin

however much i respect your views a redirect to the clairvoyance article  would however be entirely meaningless one is not exchangeable for the other  like cheese isnt milk etc

covering the groundwork general background to establish a context for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general needed to be done  and it might as well happen at the Clairsentience page for now  

the reason i did it there was because fundamental doubts were being expressed about my earliest articles conents were concerned implicitly announcing that the background for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general had not been done which was   as remember saying to you a few weeks ago   the frustrating context which motivated the writing of the second article with all of its references to the background research of brennan  lylle  mckenna  bohm  wilber  sheldrake   etcbecause this background had to be established before any specifics about clairsentience could even be begun to be aproached   thus the many weeks days and months of toil which has been endured to even get this background matereal into a wikpedia format and guidlines shape    all of which criterea have been met   or at leasst  were until the finished product was mindlessly deleted

the new additional altered states matereal  was a tentative beginning into finding a context for tentatively describing the specifics of the clairsentience phenomena itself

but  agian it was trashed with no thought or care 

Redirect

I didnt redirect the article What I said is that it probably should be Im happy that youre getting in there and editing and learning the ropes but my personal opinion is that it should be redirected and that is based on the idea that whats there is mostly about alternate states of consciousness and reality and not really about the extrasensory clairsentience I dont think theres enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page 90 of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real Thats fine but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself The content about altered states of reality etc should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article I didnt however redirect it Nealparr yell at mefor what ive done
