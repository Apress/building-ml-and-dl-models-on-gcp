I dont really have strong opinions about this Id lean towards saying that if the draft page were nominated for deletion itd probably be kept now It seems like it probably squeaks past WPGNG and it seems like WPBLP1E would be satisfied If you want to move it into mainspace Im not really opposed As Kudpung says move it on over and see what happens
