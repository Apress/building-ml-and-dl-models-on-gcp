Hi
HI Julian knock knock Can you let the bald guy in Im refraining from joining in at the village pump but can I just say that the idea of the bot creating a few articles automatically is so many editors such as myself can no longer spend all our time creating articles on geo stubs and trying to address the huge bias on here but can focus on quality on building up stubs to start class articles I dedicate a lot of time to wikipedia and creating new articles but if I could soley spend my editing time on here writing the articles things would be looking a lot better  1000000
