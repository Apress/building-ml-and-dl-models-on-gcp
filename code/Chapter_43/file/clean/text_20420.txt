Thanks for filling in references for the Cooling tower article

Thanks for furnishing some references James I realize that you are fairly new to Wikipedia but it is much better to cite references using methods outlined in HelpFootnotes so that they appear in the References section  rather than just using an inline link to a web site This time I will take the liberty of converting your links to references as per HelpFootnotes  but it would be most useful if you learned the method as shown in the section HelpFootnotesMultiple_insertion_of_the_same_reference

Also I would still very much appreciate your review and comments on my previous message just above about moving most of the Legionella material from the Cooling tower article to the Legionella article and perhaps other appropriate articles Please post your comments on the TalkCooling tower page

Regards and thanks
