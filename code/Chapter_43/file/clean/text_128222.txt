Bravo  You took what I felt all along and put it in much clearer words

Dylans former Christianity was notable and thus belongs on this list Personally Im for merging the two articles about current and former converts It puts all the information on one page and can only improve the encyclopedic content If a celebritys Christian conversion played a significant part in his life whether or not hes still a convert it needs to be mentioned so that others may know This improves the quality of the information we have on this person
