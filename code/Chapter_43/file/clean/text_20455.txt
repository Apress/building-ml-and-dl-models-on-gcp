Hi  if it is relevant to the article you might want to quote text inside a paragraph You could use a quote box template just like httpsenwikipediaorgwikiOscar_WildeImprisonment or simply choose the block quote from the dropdown formatting list in the top left of the visual editor like httpsenwikipediaorgwikiOscar_WildeEarly_life
Regarding the image cant you find it from another source Probably not Maybe just try to think of something else free of copyright Maybe an Irish riot or something like that
Good that the article is out now but consider adding also the reference number to the trials you quote
