Thanks for pointing this out Nearly all the contributions to the discussion were from administrators who probably regularly check ANI and saw what had happened so there was probably no harm done However it is just as well to be sure so I have belatedly informed everyone who took part in the discussion inviting them to start a new section if they have any more to say on the issue
