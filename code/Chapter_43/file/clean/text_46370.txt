Johnbod Im unclear as to what youre complaining about  What specifically is the POV that you see here  

I originally would have agreed with Haldraper but I think its not quite so cutanddried as liberal land reformers against oligarchical private landowners and the Church as a landowner  Sometimes the regimes targeted all the land owners secular and clerical  Other times they targeted just the Church  The Church was not only targeted because it owned land but because they controlled all aspects of society ie from marriage to baptism to last rites and burial on church grounds  Secular reformers saw this as a stranglehold whereby the Church could get anything it wanted not just from owning land but by controlling who could marry have a legitimate child or even die within the Church  The Church was also targeted because it tended to support the landowners in a conservative alliance  Finally the Church was targeted by a number of revolutionary regimes because it had supported the Spanish monarchy against the rebels  You cant really blame them but it doesnt help to have supported losing side
