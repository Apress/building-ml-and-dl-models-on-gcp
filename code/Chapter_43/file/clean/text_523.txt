While I agree that Indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying Second there is no proof at all that the mighty Sarasvati of the Rigveda was in fact this now dry river the identification is itself open to doubt Apart from there being factsproof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river  including geological facts as to why it dried up The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus  refuting point 3 of the passage quoted above  and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of its own And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system none of them are of the scale of Harrapa  Mohenjodaro leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one Saraswati did existtoday the timing is disputed and not the existence Wheter it is vedic and indic vs Harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than its existence
