I think I understand your position now And that would certainly be effective at eliminating false credentials claims However it also would eliminate a great many true credentials claims and the underlying premise of the proposal is that true claims are beneficial You may disagree with that premise but thats a different discussion I would like to find a way to verify pseudonymous claims while still generally preserving privacy I do think thats possible within reason although probably not in an absolutely fraudproof way As you point out in your opening contribution the verifiers must be trusted since not just anyone could recheck otherwise it wouldnt be preserve privacy Thats the main design challenge remaining in my view Derex
