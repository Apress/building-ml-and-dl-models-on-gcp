I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WPOR are relevant to this discussion
Obvious deductions are not original research  This includes simple logical deductions For example if A is in district B and district B is in province C then A is in province C This is a simple syllogism Included are all of the other simple deductions It is an obvious deduction that Leas Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap
Identifying synonymous terms and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names This does not require a third source to state this explicitly as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources UK sources use the term cervical cap to refer to multiple devices available in that country   Many older US sources use the term cervical cap to refer exclusively to the Prentif device here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only cervical cap  A few current US sources such as those cited by David use the term cervical cap to refer exclusively to the FemCap device  Some US sources include the Leas Shield under the cervical cap umbrella  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages foreign language sources are also welcome and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias NonEnglish sources identify the Leas Shield as a cervical cap
Sources may be written in a fictional nationalistic religious or other narrow context Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader more encyclopedic context Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context For example material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a worldwide viewpoint This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used Taking material from the US  where only one cervical cap first Prentif then later FemCap was available for many decades and so cervical cap is synonymous with a single device  and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a worldwide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Leas Shield is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia

I am not attached to the title of cervical cap for this article  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Leas Shield into this article but like David and Una I am open to looking for a new name  Anon are you willing to consider a merge with a name change  If so we can discuss alternatives to cervical barrier which you have objected to Talk     C
