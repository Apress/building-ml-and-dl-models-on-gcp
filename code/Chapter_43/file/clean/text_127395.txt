User 
Hi Tony as far as I know once you are a user in one Wikipedia somehow you become a user in allmost of the others including for example Commons I may be wrong in this however I dont remember having created a user id and password in the Spanish Wikipedia yet I have an account there

In any event part of the secret has something to do with something called unified logins and you can find which wikipedias you are attached to by going to   My Preferences  Basic Information  Global Account status  Manage your global account

I dont know how it decides which wikis to attach you to and which ones not for example I am not attached to Wikitravel but what the heck it works for the Spanish English and Commons which is where I spend 99 of my wiki time

I have been editing the Spanish Wikipedia and will probably do so even more in the future it allows me to reach the other 50 of Puerto Ricans that dont read English fluently Check out my article in teh Spanish wiki for Millito Navarro  I started by translating it from the English Wiki and now the Spanish version is not only more complete than the English counterpart but also has 3x the references is more current and probably most importantly it has an accurracy that can be backed up 100 You know I cant be contect with incomplete articles if the rest of teh info is readily available 

I will be more than happy to fulfill you request for the move and have already sone so  I had read negative comments about the Spanish Wikipedia related to how much more problematic it was to edit how editors there didnt know what they where doing and how there seem to be not a fully developed system for dealing with conflicts etc Some a little of that may be true the rest may be perception only I am learning the ropes there and stay out of trouble by creatingediting article most people dont care about for now read Ponce  haha but once interest develops I know I have the truth well under my belt to deal with the sporadic driveby editor that wants to make changes based on unacceptable motives personal political etc  you know what I am talking about rather than verifiable truth   

Also its very easy to jump to appear logged in and all from one wiki to the other just take an article in the English wiki which you know also exists in Spanish wiki and hit the link on the left that says Spanish and bingo you are there I use Cerro de Punta because it exists in both wikis AND because it is short and thus I dont have to scroll down to see the Spanish link
