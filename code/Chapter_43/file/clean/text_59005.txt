Actual Facts 

The statement that when apprehended he was standing in the middle of the street staring at the sky is false and was put into the police report merely for decorum One of the arresting officers told me the guy was singing the song Never Gonna Give You Up out loud when they cuffed him Later the other officer the one who wrote the report confirmed this to me personally He decided against including this in the report since he didnt think it was all that relevant and he didnt want to get in trouble with his supervising officer over what might be construed as a joke in bad taste apparently he and his supervisor didnt get along
I know that by now they must have told this to many other people it was already an open secret Both agents have since relocated so i guess many more people may know about this by now So if anyone out there has also heard this version please say so Note that merely adding this to the article will earn you an immediate and relentless accusation of vandalism so its probably best to comment here first Unless you can provide reliable sources cant see how or you also happen to be one of those triggerhappy admins who gets off on blocking other people In which case i guess youll be split between adding an unsourced statement to the article and blocking yourself My suggestion Do both in the proper order
