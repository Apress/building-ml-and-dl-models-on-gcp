Undue weight to Islam
I noticed that the description about Islam is too long compared to other religions As Islam has a main article Islam in Japan the desctiption here should be a summary of the article From the NPOV point of view It should be reduced to less than main religions or preferably 100 words 

Word counts of each religin are
Shinto 437
Buddism 578
New religions 240
Minorities
Christianity 292
Islam 843
Bahai Faith 17
Judaism 24
Ryukyuan 15
Sikhism 23
