If you are going to put in Iranians in your List of Azerbaijanis then it will say Iranians next to their names You dont go to List of Israelis to find the names of all the famous Jews in the world do you Iranians belong in the list of Iranians simple as that that is why the list of Iranians is in there The list of Azerbaijanis should only include those from the R of Azerbaijan I see no more point in discussing this issue any further either those three figures should be removed as well as the Iranians 0205 9
