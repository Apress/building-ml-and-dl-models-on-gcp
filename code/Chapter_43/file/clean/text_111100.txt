Another Question 

Hello again
I have read through the links they are very helpful  Thanks  I have made the changes to the headings and subheadings italics instead of bolds and moved the external links to a links section rather than in the article  I have changed the footnotes thanks for help on thatand I believe I did as you instructed for the reference list but a strange thing has happened in the Reference section of my article  I have the references repeating themselves multiple times  I am not sure what I have done to get this result

Also I am interested in building a sidebar with a picture and summary of Mulfords life similar to what is found on Carl Sagans Wikipage but for one thing I dont know what to call it so I cant search for help on creating it within the article  Can you direct me further

I believe I have otherwise met the verifiable and reliable sources requirement although I admit that I have wondered if interviewspersonal diaries can be considered valued biographical sources in Wikepedia I believe I am maintaining a neutral point of view and I believe Mulfords life to be notable as evidenced by the large collection at UCF of his lifes work  

Once I have everything done Id like to ask for one last preview to see if you see any other glaring problems
Thanks for your help
