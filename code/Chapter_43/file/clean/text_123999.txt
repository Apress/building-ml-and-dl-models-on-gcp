Please see User_talkCospringsMass_deletions_without_explanations  This has apparently been going on for some time   
Thanks for the heads up  I intended to leave him a message but got distracted The 45 

 Regarding your email 
Go ahead  32 
Ive looked things over  I dont see anything that requires a block or administrative action in any way  This is a new user who is unfamiliar with Wikipedias conflict of interest guidelines and needs to be gently directed that way  Ask him to use the article talk page and discuss the matter cordially with him  The sort of things you sent me go one many times every day on Wikipedia  I could find a dozen or more conversations in the last 24 hours that look functionally identical to the one you sent me and it isnt particularly unusual or out of the norm  Its just someone who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia and upset because they dont understand how Wikipedia works  In the spirit of WPDOLT we need something like WPDOCOI Dont Overlook Conflicts of Interest  People with conflicts of interest may have valid concerns about article content we shouldnt brush them off as though they dont have something valuable to add to the discussion  We should instead try to work with them in alleviating their concerns or at least educate them in Wikipedias policies keeping in mind they are an outsider  Be gentle and clear  Thats my advice  Also direct him to express his concerns onwiki rather than via email discussions of article content should happen in the open  32 

Wondering what you think
Hello TOJ I agree with your removal of the multitude of run times in the Once Upon a Time in America On the other hand I would ask you to consider including the European run time of 229 minutes Various considerations include the fact that runtime is the one that premiered at Cannes also we include both the Cannes and US release dates in the infobox and we could label the two runtimes the same way One other thing while I cant remember the exact time frame but I know the 229m version did get showings in the US within a few months maybe weeks of the short versions release because much like the two releases of Brazil I held off going to the theater until I could see the longer version If you disagree that is okay this was just a suggestion If you want to move this discussion to the films talk page that is okay too Cheers and have a good week   Talk 
I agree with you  If the 229 min version was show at Cannes that time should be in the infobox  That was a mistake on my part  Thanks for letting me know The 45

You removed the a Conspiracy Theory category from that article as being already in a subcategory  I dont see it  Perhaps you intended to move it to CategoryDocumentary films about conspiracy theories but it wasnt there and Im not sure it is accurate  Its more Documentary films which are conspiracy theories but Im not sure of your intent     talk 
I am not sure what I was doing earlier but I think CategoryDocumentary films about conspiracy theories is accurate The 45
