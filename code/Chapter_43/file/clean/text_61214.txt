Thank you very much indeed for taking the time to leave a message here and talk to the guy  You might guess that Im not particularly new here I edit quite frequently and contribute substantial amounts of article text  You might be interested to know that mindless reverts of IP edits followed by abusive harassment in the form of accusations of vandalism is very very common  Your ability to discriminate between vandalism and nonvandalism should not be unusual but it is  If you want to see this for yourself go anonymous and see how long it is before someone reverts you with a false accusation of vandalism  I get angrier and angrier every time it happens Im afraid  1901633204
