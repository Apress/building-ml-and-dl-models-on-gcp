I think you are dead on with the rewrite  Now that you mention it the big three was bothering me for the same reason and I did not realize it until you said something  Now if we can get DMorpheus to sign off on it I think we will be OK  It seems to me that we have to include the relibility issue somewhere in the article in order to insure balance  Somewhere I have an Ordnance Dept analysis of a T34 that they tested  The reliability of the drive train was terrible with the engine lasting only a few hours before it went kaput  Ill try to find it but dont bet that I do because I cant seem to find anything anymore
