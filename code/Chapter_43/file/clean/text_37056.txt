You can use polar moment of inertia to calculate the rotational inertia of an object with constant crosssection

 where I is the rotational inertia of the object
  is the polar moment of inertia of the crosssection of the object
  is the density of the material 
 and l is the length of the object
 Unlike the torsion application this is true for every crosssectional shape even noncircular shapes
