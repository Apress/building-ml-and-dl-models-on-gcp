Deletion review Simon Strelchik 

Calton its hard to say what to do here I have the feeling the whole sockpuppet thing is sort of like the OJ case the LAPD framed a guilty man In other words if all the puppets were subtracted from the three AfDs Im still not sure what the result would be Im guessing it would not be a consensus for deletion No Im not willing to do the math but it looks like there have been a few attempts themselves possibly puppetinfested 

I dont think the presence of sockpuppets supporting an article necessarily justifies its deletion if the article is otherwise supportable I think Canadian Federal election candidates from the major parties can reasonably be considered suitable for articles but I can be persuaded otherwise Well see how it goes In any case thanks for the clarification about the accounts confirmed by CheckUser to be socks I agree that the whole VaughanWatch think unlike Simon Strelchik et al was totally out of control Cheers  

Sir
Having read your comments on this Deletion review may I politely ask how many edits it is necessary to have undertaken and am I right in assuming that you would only count constructive and unchallengedunreverted edits before one is qualified to comment on DRvs and I would assume also AFD and similar issues   Clearly if such a qualification is required then I have been an egregious offender
