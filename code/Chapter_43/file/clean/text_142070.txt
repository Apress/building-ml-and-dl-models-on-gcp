Deletion of Finney Ross Master Leathersmith 

Dear Sir

First off I apologize if I mess this up as I am a computer idiot

My page on Finney Ross  Master Leathersmith was removed and I believe that to be an error

Under section A47 it states It does not indicate how or why the subject is notable

Finney Ross was a South Texas Pioneer in leathersmithing for the RCA at that time the Rodeo Cowboys Association It has since been changed to the PRCA Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association

His works graced the likes of Larry Mahan Freckles Brown Jim Shoulders Casey Tibbs just to name a FEW and most are now PRCA Hall of Fame inductees

During Rosss leathersmithing days in the 50s 60s and 70s  it was unheard of in the rodeo world to have one leathersmith dominate an entire state But Rosss works were so sought after that famous cowboy after cowboy would only reccommend Ross

To this day not only are his works highly collectible and valuable because of WHO he was and WHAT he did but Larry Mahan who is on the board of trustees for the PRCA still retains all of his Ross items and still speaks of his works and contibutions to the RCA to this day You may contact Mr Mahan to verify 

The old days of Rodeo and all the history behind it are slowly fading away I would much appreciate you putting the page back up I know that it doesnt seem like much of a statement to the world but in the world of rodeoit actually is

Thank you for your time and consideration
