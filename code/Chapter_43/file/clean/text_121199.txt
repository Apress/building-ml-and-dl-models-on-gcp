 Kudos to you 


Kudos reverting vandalism contributing chunks to articles and otherwise being a competent user Perhaps youll become an admin some day 

Sincerely  

 Harry Potter  Slavery 

Hermione I inadvertently reverted past your last edit on the Harry Potter page  Please feel free to readd the sentence that I accidentally nuked  I think we were making changes at roughly the same time  
 Actually never mind  I took care of it  Sorry again   
 Although he is reverting again and I feel like I am too close to the 3RR to do anything about it today   
 No objections to listing an RfC  
 Dont let him get to you  Youre doing fine  The important thing is to continue to edit boldly and work calmly to achieve consensus  Hes just irritated because we pointed out that he made a poor edit  Most of his work is good but some people cant handle any criticism at all  

 HP WikiProject 

An anonymous user recently did some major moving around of pages on the WikiProject which I have reverted I told the anon that I felt that such major changes should at least have some discussion first before being made I also disagreed with the changes so I personally would oppose the changes that were made I just wanted to let you know since youve been a pretty active participant in the project  talk 2346 August 7 2005 UTC

Dont worrythere isnt some coordinated campaign going on  A Toronto online paper copied the Wikipedia entry pretty much word for word in a promo for Thursdays concert which has led to some discussion on the fan boards  Some attempted deletes are inevitable  Itll pass  I think it would help if you didnt think of these folks as the enemyjust folks who dont agree with the paragraph being there and arent familiar with how Wikipedia works  And why am I not here reverting  Because Im over there trying to explain how Wikipedia works so maybe therell be fewer problems over here  

 Requesting comments on template alteration
