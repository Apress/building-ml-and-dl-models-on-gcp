Sionk you seem like a reasonable sort  It may seem that I was overly verbose in my calling out of the harassment of the editors in question but you are probably only privy to a fraction of the abuse they subjected me to  They are adept at deleting their most agregious abuses  It seems to me that when people follow you around and hound you it needs to be exposed  You would think that my proving the WPNONPROFIT status as I had early on it would be obvious as it was to you that the case was closed but instead I had 4 editors constantly telling me that I was wrong and they were right that my sources were not reliable and no matter what I did even to the point of following the advice of Melanie directly it was never good enough for them  Without you coming onto the thread and setting the record straight they would still be calling out inappropriate policies and attacking me  As it stands Cybercobra has had one of his friends ban me for simply revealing his behavior  I could care less tbh  The fact remains that he has been called to account numerous times in one ANI after another  He has been accused of sockpuppetry enough that a formal investigation should be undertaken 

If I wouldnt have spent this time arguing with them they would have deleted the article already  I hope you understand that even if my behavior wasnt exactly stellar in this it was the only thing i could actually do when being ganged upon by a clear clique of editors who took an unnatural interest in me personally
