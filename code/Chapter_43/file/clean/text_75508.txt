I never objected to the removal of uncited material I would like it if you can just tag any uncited claims just those of fact you would like cited now so that I can review it later to see if I can find citations Ive been very busy as of late with school and midterms so I havent been able to keep up on this article What I do not like is large scale edits 8 edits this time in which you mix up legitimate removals of uncited material with assertions of opinion so that when I revert which I have no choice to since I do not have the time to go through all the edits you can accuse me of opposing the removal of uncited material Ive seen this tactic used on this article and several others by yourself and do not like it and would appreciate it if you could stop doing it Thank you
