Ok  Thank You for your help and insight  This page Clearly states that the new wave of british heavy metal is one of the components thus the heavyier feel than punk  Someone put in metal I thought it was already there for a long time it kept getting removed  after some careful thought I was there I studied music history from Johnny Dodds to hardcore punk  I looked it to it and it makes total sense The complaint from one page is there was no source and it was tagged I think as as fact claim  I looked to see if there was a source there was  it got removed all of a sudden by 3 pages No explanation  Except the kind of cop out Not reliable because its at aboutcom  the writer is a college educated journalist since late 80s Not aboutcom he just wrote something they host 

So a completely different page gets created and reverts it anytime I put it back so I decided to further inspect the story and online history section at the page in the UK section which is part of the creation Next to a Picture of Lemmy says Referred to under a number of names including UK Hardcore UK 82 second wave punk66 real punk67 and No Future punk68 it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant heavy drumbeats and distorted guitar sound of New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands especially Mot√∂rhead69
So I felt the heavy metal  may have mislead and changed it to the more appropriate NWOBHM and this new page changes it its the only thing the page has ever done  created a few days ago no explanation no discussion on the talk page removing sourced material and contradicting the article itself  Now that page has done 4 reverts in one dayCan you go and see this please I dont always sign in to my page and I realize I may have not reached the status to be able to handle this by not getting credit for all my work here  
Ill probably never ask you for help again buy you seem to be Very helpful  Thank You
