For someone who claims to be a radio expert he cant figure out that 
1 WSFF does in fact NOT broadcast in HD Radio The official HD Radio site can confirm that
2 WJJSWJJX hasnt had their Rhythmic CHR format in nearly three years
3 Cant tell the difference between Urban Contemporary and Urban ADULT Contemporary
4 WSNV has dropped their Oldies format and is purely Classic Hits

I think Im more of an expert than he claims to be
