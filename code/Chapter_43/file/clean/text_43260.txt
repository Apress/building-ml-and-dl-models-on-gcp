We have Emperor Meiji and not Mutsuhito or Mutsuhito of Japan Likewise we have Emperor Taishō and not Yoshihito of Japan and similar for all of the 100 other deceased emperors of Japan Wikipedia should be consistent and use Emperor Shōwa with disambiguation pages as necessary There is a lot of comment on most common usage in English Most common is not necessarily most correct If wikipedia is to be a meaningful reference and encyclopedia it should promote usage of the most correct term over what some people may feel is most common With the automatic redirect function there should not be any confusion at all if the article is titled Emperor Shōwa and the commonly used name Hirohito redirects to it
