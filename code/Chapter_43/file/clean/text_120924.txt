UserBaristarim decides that the quote I added should be blanked stating his opinion that Gaddafi is not relevant  Also I added a citation request for articles that clearly show Merkel supports Turkeys accession  From what Ive read she does not want Turkey in the EU and is a clear proponent of the special partnership  I would appreciate if users such as the one aforementioned refrain from their POV motives
