SPA concerns 

Hi  I appreciate your edits to Gilad Atzmon and your comments on TalkGilad Atzmon  I would like to see less conflict on the article and more harmonious editing so everything you can do in that regard would be appreciated  One thing that worries me is that it looks like your account was created simply to edit the Atzmon article  Whether true or not it might help if you join a WikiProject and get some experience working on other types of articles such as articles about Israel Jewish biogrphies Jewish culture etc  Let me know if I can point you in the right direction
