I did not neglect to mention reliable sourcing  You deleted the references in this talk page commentary  Click on the links and you will see the reference  The cited reference claim you added for population density as the reason fails fact checking if you will but click on the D reference that you inserted into the article  There is no personal point of view at issue here stop the false accusations  Just look at the reference for the statement that you put into the article for the cite that you put in  the cited reliable source reference doesnt say population density is the issue but rather that gang violence is the issue  If you want to add other sources for population density too that would be fine  But dont claim a cite says something it does not  You have been repeatedly warned about sticking to the sources  This is but another example of you failing to stick to the sources
