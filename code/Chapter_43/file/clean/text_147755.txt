Hello years ago I added these links to show it was genocide and had the page moved to 1984 Sikh Genocide   As Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia and instead is instead a biased social commentary catering to the majority the Hindu community which vastly outnumbers the Sikh community keeps having it moved back to this page and they replace the lead wording with riots   Someone needs to come in and move the page and have it locked against Hindu vandals but there are no Sikh admins   This is the problem with Wikipedia  majority rules even in the face of cited evidence 66112191186
