Is it UNDO 
Years later its 50 of her OWN selfpromoting website My instincts tell me that loyal fans  that is fans as in the root word fanatics will contact her through her website and pled with her to remove her account of the incident or see her memory besmirched on Wikipedia  Thats just humor to make a point let that knot in your panties loosen up a bit Come on Life will go on if a mild accurate account of the arrest is included JFK had multiple extra marital affairs people are interested in that fact In Clintons day people were so interested that he went through impeachment because of his outsideofmarriageactivities In Mary Anns case it is all the more interesting because it allegedly has been her costar Gilligan supplying her marijuana for years

BLP 
No one answers Chowboks questions on any of the reasons why this information is blocked that is answer in the sense of saying anything other than rhetoric WHY MUST THIS INTERESTING EVENT BE EXCLUDED FROM WIKIPEDIA WHEN THE SUBJECTS OWN WEBSITE DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IT Because those guarding her memory unlike her cant deal with a least brief mention of the truth But in that vein are we as loyal citizens of Gilligans Island dutybound to protect our virgin queen Grow up Let the truth be included

If Mary Ann writes a biography the excerpts released by the publisher will assuredly include the arrest while in possession of marijuana and those facts will be the ones that bring attention to her book The most worn pages of her biography will be the pages discussing the arrest and the aftermath unless it turns out that she was in a longrunning threesome with Mr Howell and the Skipper Oh by the way why do I refer to her as Mary Ann Because I am being disrespectful much like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of you are to Chowbok and anyone else who disagrees with you No amount of charm or politeness on my part is going to win a single one of you over You need to rise above the digs and the rhetoric and improve this article because the exclusion of this information of significant interest to the vast majority of people hurts Wikipedia If you cant get over sweet Mary Ann getting her adorable little button nose dirty or you cant rise above me being disrespectful you surely wont elevate yourselves to include the facts simply because it is editorially the right decision 
I
F YOU WANT TO PLAY THE ROLE OF EDITOR THEN TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF DOING THE JOB WITH THE PRIDE OF MAKING UNBIASED EDITORIAL DECISIONS If you are simply a Mary Ann worshipper then join her fan club bow towards Gilligans Island seven times a day and burn incense before her golden image but dont pretend to be an editor with the slightest degree of integrity

Years later HER ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT is told only through the words of her lawyer She refuses to give a personal account I find that fascinating Even OJ spoke personally when he denied murdering his exwife Hell in his case he spoke DIRECTLY to the Judge in front of a live TV audience even though he had four of his lawyers standing right next to him Mary Ann on her own website still hides behind the unsigned words of her lawyer I highly recommend reading his words If the presentationspin upon the events is not hysterical to you you have not yet developed the critical thinking necessary to be an editor well anywhere but on Wikipedia interestingly a place I do not have the right to edit the Sacred Page of The Virgin Mary Ann 
The CONSENSUS is that Mary Ann is MORE WIDELY KNOWN for the arrest while in possession of marijuana than anything else she has ever done Its not only the top single reason that anyone searches for information on her variations on arrestmarijuanadrunk driving are the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the any searches about her

BE BOLD 
Be Bold and edit says Wikipedias founder But the bullies on this issue say if you are bold you will be sent messages to stop editing and we will block you from editing anything about Mary Ann as her page is protected 

I can go to the Wikipedia page of Wikipedia creator and founder Jimmy Wales and edit anything I chose on his page but not so Mary Ann I can even go to the page about that other Mary  you might have heard of her she gave birth to Jesus Christ Lord and Savior  and edit anything and everything

What credibility can any editor of Wikipedia have when its founders page can be edited pages of living and revered religious and historical figures can be edited but editing of a 1960s short run ensemble cast sitcom bit players page must be reviewed and approved by selfproclaimed editors aka BOGI the Bullies Of Gilligans Island
