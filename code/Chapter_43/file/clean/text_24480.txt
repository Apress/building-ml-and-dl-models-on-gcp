Look at the list Its two completely different things That poseur list essentially is not real emo bands And I would have just merged mine into that one but the problem is that article has a dictator that only allows the most absurd of edits to pass He thinks a community college newspaper is a credible source and clings to a site like allmusiccom that is notorious for errors When you call him out on anything like that he ignores it and runs away He doesnt even respond on the talk page when you want to discuss the addition or deletion of a band You can never get anything done with him around Those dispute resolution procedures wont do crap He was banned for a day too and weasled his way out of it Ive never had a problem with anyone else on here Im not the only one that sees his selfimposed dictatorship on certain topics My solution to avoiding him was making new articles and ignoring his The articles I created were done no differently from the countless articles already on this site He purposely went after them because I made them How is it my fault when you have someone that controls all the edits of an article and then doesnt let anyone else make their own as well Hes trying to run things here
