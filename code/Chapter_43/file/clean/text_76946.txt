Acupuncture HAS been proven effective in every single study ever conducted The criticism that fanatic skeptics extremists have of it is that while the difference between acupuncture and no treatment is very very large in every case the difference between acupuncture and socalled sham acupuncture is small sometimes even clinically insignificant

But this phenomenon makes total sense when we take into account the fact that this sham acupuncture is not analogous to placebo at all but in fact is strikingly similar to a very authentic traditional style of Japanese acupuncture shallow needle insertionnonpenetration alternate acupoint and meridian location etc that has been in common use for centuries are is still widely practiced to this very day

The fact is acupuncture is effective and its silly to even try to test it against a placebo in the first place because its not a pill or a drug or a substance that lends itself to such methodology 

So what if some of acupunctures effects originate in the mind TCM theory itself states that in therapy the mind leads the qi the qi leads the blood indeed predicting itself the main criticism that fanatic skeptic extremists have against it
