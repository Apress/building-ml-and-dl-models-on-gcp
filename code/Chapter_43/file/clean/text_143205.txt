Hi Benne Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter منصورة manṣūrä This comes frot the root نصر naṣara meaning help or make victorious interestingly in derived form II it means Christianize Therefore منصور manṣūr means helped supported victorious The place name is the feminine version of this perhaps representing the old accusative with locative meaning In Arabic many place names begin with the definite article Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isnt Sometimes its transliterated as Al and sometimes its El The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura Mansoura Mansoora Mansurah Mansourah Mansoorah Mansureh Mansoureh Mansooreh It would make sense to have all of these alternatives with and without alternatives of definite article linking to a disambiguation page However the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these so it might take precedence over the disambig Ill see if I can tidy it up a little
