Hi Tawker  First congratulations on the mop and broom  Second thanks for the note on the scanner  Im not sure what is up with those Saudi IPsthey seem to be part of a range but I dont know if security is still compromised there or not obviously it was a month ago since squidward was able to use several of them  I unblocked two of the IPs as a courtesy to the person who posted to the noticeboard  Cheers   talk
