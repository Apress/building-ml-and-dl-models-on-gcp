You dont own wikipedia 

You are ignoring others edits and enforcing your own views here As can be seen on your talk page many people are unhappy with your revisions I have told you repeatedly that Bob Lynch created that article and that article should be deleted as it is against wikipedias policy You should be blocked from editing any articles here and your account should be deleted I am reverting back my edits and i am putting Bob Lynchs image on the page If you try to get me blocked i will just create another account and deal with you You are a bully and your ways will not be tolerated on wikipedia  Â Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs
