I accept your appology however I feel that UserJarvis76 does not seem open to any discussion of the article at all and continues to blantly revert my edits that are attempting to conform the article to WPMOS standards ie overlinking avoiding redirects layout images etc Heres an example  Any help with UserJarvis or the Istanbul article would be appreciated
