History 
You cant say that Italian people claim to have invented noodles They only claim that they have taken over this tradition from Etruscans and Greeks Its also wrong to say the Chinese can claim for this invention because at that time there was no such thing as China in any form The people of the QuijiaCulture are also believed to be under the first groups in this region to have produced bronce wich came relatively late to Asia from the West So maybe the art of making noodles came alongside with the art of making bronce or maybe it didnt Nationalism and cuisine sucks anyway
