Those claims were reinserted with sources but the sources themselves were problematic and I have again removed that material I do not know Portuguese but this article fails to support some of the more lurid claims made in a paragraph about some explicit videotapes phrases cited do not appear at all in that source Im not certain but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work This appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life though Taveira is discussed on that page and the claim could be true We cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though

The BLP issues here are significant as are questions of weight since most of the previous version of the article was given over to controversy rather than a discussion of his career Please do not readd the material in question without discussing it here on the talk page Id also appreciate a note on my talk page if such a discussion begins though I have watchlisted this We almost certainly need better sources and we also need help from Portuguesespeaking editors   talk   contribs
