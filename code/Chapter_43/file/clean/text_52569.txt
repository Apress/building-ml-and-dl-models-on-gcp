UserAntaeus Feldspar invited himself into a discussion on my user page  He gave his opinion which included Terryeo lied about other editors and   made false accusations with nothing to back them up  When I moved the discussion to my discussion page User TalkTerryeo I asked him to stop his personal attacks  He and I replied to each other and might have worked it out  But his most recent statement denys good faith by threatening what he is going to do at my next RfAr Full Discussion 
That is the situation tells me to notify you directly I am doing so Please stop your personal attacks
