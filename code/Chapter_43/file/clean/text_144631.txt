I removed the link to the Nouvelle Droite  Edward Goldsmith is not affiliated with the Nouvelle Droite  If I am not mistaken he appeared once or twice at a Nouvelle Droite function with Alain de Benoist but he has also appeared at many other kinds of functions and therefore this does not indicate he belongs to the Nouvelle Droite

This is by the way not meant as an attack on the Nouvelle Droite
