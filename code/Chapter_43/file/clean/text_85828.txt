V is not equal to IR
Facts

1 In chemisty the number of electrons leaving a mass is determined by the voltage Source chemistry textbook 
2 In induction physics the current is determined by the number of coils in the winding source physics textbooks 
3 In circiut theory the current is determined by the load Source also physics textbook 
4 these three things are all different 
5 In the power industry there is also something called current draw which is a current not determined by the load but the power supply Source Con Edison training manual 
6 All of these things with the exception of 5 are excepted theories of science that contflict with the electricity theory
7 The units for charge are wrong The 4pi that is in F  q1q24pir2 the 4 pi is found experimentaly but is from the units

I find that most circuits textbooks dont even talk at all about any scientist Many of whom pointed out alot of these things
What I demand

1 A scientific presentation of electricity theory that uses the scientific method 
2 A list of people in the scientific community who actually accepted this and hold electrons to be a fact and more than a theory and on what basis of the scientific method did they accept it
