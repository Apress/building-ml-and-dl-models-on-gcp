I came here looking for some information and I still thinks it reads like a fan site  Not just the sources but even the beginning  with references to MJ I have never seen that as a common nickname outside of fan sites and headlines where information needs to be condensed as much as possible For example the MJ reference does not use MJ anywhere in the article  I am not a Hater but I do use SPNPOV and I dont feel this article meets that criteria  talk Contributions
