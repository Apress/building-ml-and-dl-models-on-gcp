Designing for is not the same as issued I have a knife that was designed for the Navy SEAL by their specs 5 prototypes were made and used by the SEALs but the Navy Brass found it to be too aggressive It was redesigned with a new profile and the new model was issued Does that make my original piece a SEAL knife because it was designed for them and field tested by them No However the model that was based on it was adopted and is considered a SEAL knife Same with the Striker  Μολὼν λαβέ
