I am going to let someone else review your article so you dont get the idea that I am picking on you but to put it for review now is way premature  You have no references  Everything that is in your reference list is what is called selfsourcing in other words related in some way to the subject of the article  YouTube is not a reliable source  See WPRS  Wikipedia only publishes what others are writing about  If you have no newspaper or magazine articles about your band it isnt notable enough for a Wikipedia article  It appears that your band has some potential but I am sure you realize that playing in bars in San Diego is a looooooong way from the Grammys  Read WPBAND WPGNG which is the basic standard for inclusion in Wikipedia and the above mentioned WPRS  Then honestly think about whether or not you are wasting your time with this  Wikipedia is not the place to start trying to promote your band and you are a long way away from an article from what you have and what I have seen on the internet  There is a huge backlog at AfC so your article probably wont get reviewed for at least a week  Please take this for what it is advice  I am not your enemy  I am just trying to get you to see what you are working with  Good Luck  I wish you all the success in the world  I have been around musicians all my life and I know it is a very difficult row to hoe  I hope you find your way down that long road  If you have any questions you are welcome to message me on my talk page
