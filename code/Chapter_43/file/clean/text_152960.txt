Well the second news item right now is about the Okogbe road tanker explosion that occurred on 12 July 2012 when a road tanker in Okobie Nigeria fell into a ditch spilled fuel and then exploded Of course we are saddened by loss of life anywhere and I dont want to belittle loss of life But a road accident is hardly an international news item Road accidents happen all the time This is a very questionable item as far as newsworthiness goes By the way today is July 14 and a lot of time has passed from that accident But still its there Just anoter proof that page is not updated often as far as news items go
