I have not created article List of Roman Emperors born in Serbia but nationalistic SPA account userKaiSuTeknonBrute My only job has been moving article to another name so you can delete article  

 BC AND AD 

The reason I changed this is because simply he was a Roman and Greek and Italy and Greece use the AD and BC system

Also why not just change the dates back why also delete all the names

Also you need to stop acting like you are one of wikipedias staff because you are not

  

Is Deor out to lunch 

Here Logicus posts a serious query about Deors fitness to be meddling with Wikipedia articles that is posted on the Celestial Spheres Talk page for a serious answer by Deor that he has not provided in spite or repeated challenges to do so

Police Constable Deor  Logicus says No 

Imperious User Deor has elected to set himself up as Police Constable Wikipedian who polices Wikipedia and reports breaches of what he imagines to be its rules and breaches of its rules to its administrators Here we present Deors latest arrogant imperious mistaken comments posted to Logicuss User Talk page for everybody to read 

edit Celestial spheres redux
Im going to revert your additions and deletions once again Repeatedly adding material that is not relevant to the articles topic and in essence constitutes an original synthesis of material in primary sources is disruptive and impermissible in Wikipedia Any further disruption at this article will be brought up at WikipediaAdministrators noticeboardIncidents as you have repeatedly attempted to insert your original research and personal interpretations of historical sources into multiple articles This is an encyclopedia that relies on information gleaned from secondary sources not a forum for posting what appears to individuals to be logically inferrable from the historical record Deor talk 

Retrieved from httpenwikipediaorgwikiUser_talkLogicus 

But on the cardinal issue here of relevance it should be selfevident to one and all that any material on the causes of the motions of the celestial spheres such as the theory of Buridan is of absolutely central relevance to any article on the celestial spheres and their motions And yet Wiki User Deor repeatedly seeks to deny this and under repeated challenge to provide any rational justification for this unjustifiable POV repeatedly fails to do so  Why is this  Should User Deor be banned from meddling with Wikipedia articles because of his severe antieducational tendency Watch this space   Logicus

 Thanks 

Thanks for reverting the vandalism on my user page     

Is Deor wrong about Ptolemys alleged instrumentalism

following claim 

Through the use of the epicycle eccentric and equant this model of compound circular motions could account for all the irregularities of a planets apparent movements in the sky78

as either false or meaningless and its replacement with a meaningful and historically truthful assessment of Ptolemys achievement on the 22nd of June in Celestial spheres Talk  you claimed it is a possibility that Ptolemy for one didnt devote much thought to the problems and consequences associated with positing the physical existence of spheres epicyles etc Deor talk 

Logicus then pointed out to you that it seems this is not a possibility on the evidence of Ptolemys Planetary Hypotheses and also provided a quotation from the Introduction of Langermanns 1990 English language edition of Alhazens Configuration of the World  which quotes Ptolemys views in his Planetary Hypotheses on the two possible physical forms of the celestial bodies as follows

In Book II of Planetary Hypotheses Ptolemy undertakes to establish the shapes of the bodies that carry out the heavenly motionsHe states 

For each of these motions which are different in quantity or kind there is a body that moves freely on poles and in space and which has a special place

Ptolemy then postulates two possible paths of approach to the physical explanation of the workings of the cosmos 

The first of them is to assign a whole sphere to each motion either hollow like the spheres th
