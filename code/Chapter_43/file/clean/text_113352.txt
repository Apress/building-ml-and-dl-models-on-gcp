English when being referred to as a language is a proper noun As such it should be capitalized 

You erroneously used the word atrocious to describe the sentence structure and grammar in this article Other than two or three words that should not have been capitalized and its instead of its the whole article was intelligible right up to March 2008 I understood the whole article that is what matters to me

Are you sure that those atrocious sentence structure and grammar were not done by native English speakers
