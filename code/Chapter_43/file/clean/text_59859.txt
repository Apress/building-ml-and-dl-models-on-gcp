Article length 

As of 16 Sep 2006 the article body not including Intro and References is less than 5700 words long and 51KB in size  This is less than the suggested 6000 to 10000 word length which WikipediaArticle size notes as the limit at which readers may tire of reading a page  It is however larger than the 3050KB recommended article size  Its large size despite its reasonable length is due to the large number of footnotes and citations  Subsequent edits should try not to significantly increase the overall size of the article body
