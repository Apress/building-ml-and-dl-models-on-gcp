The image here is permissible to use   

There is more than enough proof here to maintain that it is indeed Godane and portrays the person who it is intended to portray As per the sources cited by   the onus of proof is on anyone else to provide sources which discredit the POV held by the United States State Department BBC Reuters and CNN that the image is Godane The fact that the image is featured on the Rewards for Justice website is already adequate enough proof the US State Department being one of the most premier sources for counterterrorism This is no stab in the dark Its not like this image has been randomly found on the internet with the caption Ahmed Abdi Godane below it Reputable sources state that the image is Godane as per WPV If you challenge this assertion either cite some sources which explicitly disprove this or deal with it It is as simple as that
