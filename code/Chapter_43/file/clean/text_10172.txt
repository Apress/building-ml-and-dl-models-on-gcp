Hi

 Re ɰ
 ɰ is equivalent to what some write as w and orthographically as  This sound is not phonetically w because it does not have lip rounding so some folks including me feel that ɰ is a more appropriate symbol  was useful because it was found on typewriters while ɰ had to be written in by hand  Computers are getting better at displaying this stuff so I say use the more accurate symbol
 ç is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth ç is an allophone of h but ɰ is not
 Actually ɰ is redundant since it is just a short ɯ like j is a short i and w is a short u  we could just use a nonsyllabic diacritic

 Re j
 j is supposed to mean j  It doesnt include ɰ  CɰV is not allowed In other words Japanese allows an optional j before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset ie V or jV or CV or CjV   0952 2005 Feb 7 UTC
