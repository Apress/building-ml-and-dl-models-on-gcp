Disruptive edits 

Hello  Despite s statement you have not so far been reported at WPAdministrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be Looking at your edits I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter While I know nothing of him I have some sympathy with your position But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia and you need to stop
First as you have already been told you introduced material and in particular critical material into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material This is absolutely forbidden but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable and this is what happened
What you are encouraged to do at that point is to discuss the matter on the talk page TalkJohn de Ruiter and try to reach agreement with other editors if you are unable to do so our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed
What you did do is to insert your unsupported material again This is called edit warring and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia

Assuming that you are in good faith ie that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him not blogs or forums but material from reputable publishers If you can find some then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found though in view of your recent history even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page If you cannot find such sources then Im afraid you must not edit the page further Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself If that is that case Im afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox and you may not use it in that way
