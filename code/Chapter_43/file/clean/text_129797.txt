Hello Blueboy I had a feeling this would happened after I created the account  I work as a publicist and Vanessa DeLeon is one of my clients she hired me to write and maintain this article the one and only I would create which explains my choice of user name  Most of my information is directly from her site and her personally and if her name is searched on the web most of this information is readily availble from a variety of sources  Although I do know her personally I dont think it should be reason for her information to be delted from Wikipedia all information in the article is factual and by no means did I try to make it bias I would like to keep this page and would love feedback on how I could do so  Thank you in advance for your help
