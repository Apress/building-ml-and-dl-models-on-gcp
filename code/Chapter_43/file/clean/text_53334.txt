IP is pushing POV
Hi Tedder An IP is pushing POV at Ghurids article We have been through the origin of Ghorids and after a LONG discussion we came to a consensus that we will use the term Iranian in the introduction However the IP keeps on adding that they were Persians and Tajiks I dont want to waste more time and repeat the same thing over and over again and neither do I want to break the 3RR rule You had previously protected the page I was wondering if you can take a look and semiprotect the page once again Thank you
