If you read the discussion above the problem with most of this article is was that it classifies things as being antiAmerican when thats really just an opinion Most of it was sourced with opinion pieces Calling someone antiAmerican and someone actually saying they are antiAmerican are two different things The opinions that people are antiAmerican without them actually saying theyre against America dont belong in the article because they are not factual conclusions  C  1051 10 Apr 2008 UTC
