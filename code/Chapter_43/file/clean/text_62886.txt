The statements in the lead are not only nonneutral they are slanderous

The first sentence frames the quote wanting to play the game too much as a direct quote from the EA spokesperson which is false It is nowhere to be found in the original statement this is in fact Destructoids interpretation The second sentence victimizes the users This does not belong in the article let alone the Lead For describing EAs statement I feel that leaving out a comment on players were having such a good time would be better because the phrase is ambiguous Personally I see it as PR used to express that the game keeps people happy for long periods of time Other sources see it more maliciously It is so open to interpretation that trying to write about it would not be neutral For the entire description I would write Senior producer Kip Katsarelis commented that the game servers were consistently at maximum capacity which has made it difficult for new users to connect What do you think
