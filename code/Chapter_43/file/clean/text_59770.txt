I will add that if there is consensus that only alumni that have their own articles should be listed I wont argue against that  But I am saying that its not policy to do so  and frankly I dnnt see a reason for it here  The disputed short list seems like an ok addition even if every person doesnt have their own artlcle but Ill leave that up to consensus
