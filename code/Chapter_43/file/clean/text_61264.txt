Its not so much about the English language Its about concepts and logic

No I do NOT believethinkknow that Im in the wrong here I wouldnt be talking about this if I thought I was wrong Yeah right That would be pretty dumb Puhleease

And what would be supposedly encyclopedically wrong with using a phrase like US citizen Thats been a very accepted term to use has it not Why would you or most editors want to revert that back out

Also why would you guys as encyclopedia admins prefer to cater to the wide but wrong majority of people who lazily apply the wrong logic to a word rather than standing first with whats actually logically correct and not bending to the popular vote just because its what happens to be what most people wrongly think is the right way to say something Arent encyclopedias there to show people what the REAL truth is Well then why not with this simple terminology

If I ask a Canadian or Mexican or Brazilian or whatever if she was an American and she said no then despite what she thinks is her correct belief that so many other CanadiansMexicansBrazilians errantly believe too that shows what popularity does to muddyup a fact shed be WRONG If Canadians etc were to not be Americans then how could they possibly belong to a continent CALLED  AMERICA
