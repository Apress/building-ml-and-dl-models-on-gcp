Hello Gwickwire

Thank you for your helpful advice

I went online and searched 15 different Wikipedia articles about companies and didnt find one with a green  sign  I found the green  sign in other articles but nothing that would serve as a guide for mine about a company  Any suggestions for good examples of articles written about companies

Thanks as always
