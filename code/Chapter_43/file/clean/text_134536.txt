hey I now created an account I saw you deleted the logo for the wtf
I know that not everybody thinks that the wtf event is especially
important in my point of view I think its an important event and
in case of novak I thought especially because he tied the record of three
consecutive wins last year and has this year the chance to win it
for the 4th time to hold an open era record it is of importance

I hope I can contribute in future as much as I can to help to
improve the page

and thanks for your suggestion to create an account
