Ettlinger Being Jewish  His Family 

Hi all

I learned about Adrians death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article see my post of In Memoriam about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list and since he was a good Internet friend of mine and we corresponded extensively on Email Id like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him In any case Ettlinger told me in a private Email that he was Jewish at least by descent  he wasnt an observantreligious Jew and said something about being a deist and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category One problem I see there is that I dont see any subcategory for Jewish American Engineers andor Jewish American software developers he was both I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish also only by decent American software developer and he belongs to the categories American computer programmers and American Jews and there are naturally many others I have kept most of the Emails with him so can upload them in part to my website or elsewhere for citation nut will it be considered a selfreference So what should be done

Adrian also told me about his family two children if I remember correctly and four or five grandchildren all but one are attending university now but I dont think he mentioned any names Should they be mentioned as well

Ill try to improve the entry about him in other respects Thanks to all the Wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research
