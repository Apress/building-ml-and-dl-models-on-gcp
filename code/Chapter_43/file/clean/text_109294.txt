Jayjg this is nonsense You are misquoting the subject Milliband didnt simply say Im Jewish he said Obviously Im Jewish it is part of my identity but not in a religious sense Milliband recognised that simply saying Im Jewish would lead many hearers to make a religious assumption so he qualified it You say but saying you are Jewish doesnt imply religiousness and I immediately accusing you of doing exactly what you accuse others of doing  imposing your meaning of what Jewish means Thats what you said was original research isnt it Milliband obviously recognised that simply saying Im Jewish would mislead at least some hearers into making a religious assumption  which is why qualified his selfidentity Now if you label him as Jewish  and stick him in an unqualified Jewish box you leave open the very misinterpretation that he was at pains to exclude And you do it by saying here is how I define Judish identity and worse by ignoring the fact that somemany people hearing Jewish dont share your preconception The subject has said what the subject has said We should record it We should not qualify it truncate it ignore it  or say your fears of misinterpretation are illfounded and thus your qualification unnecessaryScott Mac
