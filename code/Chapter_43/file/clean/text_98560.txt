No namecalling on my part though I have been and will continue to be unfriendly  Warnings are not namecalling though of course they are annoying and often offensive  And yes you are basing your change on your opinion on words on his blog  And the other editors attempting to insert ongoing activity are basing their changes on their opinion of the reliability of celebrity gossip sites  Neither meet wpBLP  So far 3 editors have joined the discussion and explained  wpBLP violation removal is not edit warring  If you are not swayed by the opinions of 3 editors so far and the lack of support for inclusion from wpBLPN an wpRFC seems unlikely to help  Comparatively few editors are willing to risk getting into disputed articles even to defend a BLP  But that would be a good next step if you are simply not willing to accept 3 opinions against the changeUser talkUnfriend12
