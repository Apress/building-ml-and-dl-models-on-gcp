I agree with Folwerfowler here we cant mix this section up with economic data on Dalits Yes Dalits particularly in Uttar Pradesh as an article AVC referred to earlier suggests have improved economically over the last six decades specially after the economic liberalization But if we add that data in the society section the article will appear defensive and awkward However I have a problem with the wording of the proposal as it stands now Adding especially in rural areas implies that Dalits are facing segregation and persecution in urban areas as well even if to a lesser extent Can we just go with most Dalits exUntouchables and other low castes in rural areas alk
