Scenario after the second round 

All scenarios except 5550 do not involve a threeway tiebreaker so I only explain the 5550 situation below
If Spain draw with Republic of Ireland and Italy defeat Republic of Ireland the three teams Spain Republic of Ireland and Italy will have 5 point each and 2 points each and 0 goal difference each among the three games among themselves If the SpainRepublic of Ireland match ends at a draw of 22 or higher Spain and Republic of Ireland will advance due to higher number of goals from games among teams in question If the draw game is goalless Italy will advance with a higher number of goals among teams in question while Spain and Republic of Ireland still tie As reapplying the tiebreaker on the game between Spain and Republic of Ireland doesnt help Spain will advance with Italy with a higher overall goal difference If the draw is 11 the tiebreaker on overall goal difference applies Therefore the two teams with the best results against Republic of Ireland advance
