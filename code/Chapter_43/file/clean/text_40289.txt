By your standards the Gray gene doesnt exist  They dont have a test for it either  And if you read the Mau abstract there does seem to be evidence for the gene theyve narrowed down the probable location of the gene  What is not known is if it has linkage to Sabino and sabino may be caused by a number of different genes of which only SB1 has been mapped  So far it is not known whether dominant white W and sabino spotting S share a common genetic background In this study a pedigree consisting of 87 horses segregating for dominant white W was used to genetically localize the horse Wlocus Microsatellite ASB23 was found linked to W which allowed us to map dominant white to a region on horse chromosome 3q22  So Id say it is overkill to call W an unproven theory especially when most of the dispute isnt among experts so much as among breeders who are not geneticists

Pearl and Silver Dapple
I have no problem with someone adding Pearl to the chart  If there isnt a wikipedia article on it maybe that needs to be done too  There is an article on Silver dapple but I dont think data is in the chart yet here I also am OK with creating some consistency with the gene symbols  But I  havent the time to do it Someone else sure can  Best not to start a nomenclature fight whatever is the majority view probably best maybe a paragraph explaining other terminology would help
