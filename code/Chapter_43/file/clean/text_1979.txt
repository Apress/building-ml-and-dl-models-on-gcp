While Indian tribe is official US Govt lingo saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward also the tribe is not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of people  so maybe reword to say something like The Coeur dAlene people once inhabited 3500000 acres 1400000 ha in northern Idaho and Washington23 And Montana actually note article on the tribe but today the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the Coeur dAlene Reservation in Benewah and Kootenai counties Idaho4 You dont have to use my wording but you see how I am distinguishing land and people though the two are of course closely intertwined

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit Id put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it then go on about how the tribe didnt accept it anyway  Keep the chronology clearer   Interesting that the Coeur dAlene article says nothing about this period maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too hmmm 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idahos statehood becomes significant in this case so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact but its something thats going to matter  
The section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the SCOTUS case
