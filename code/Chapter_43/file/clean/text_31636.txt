Hello good to see you back Yes the article needs work I agree with everything youve suggested and if theres anything in the main EastEnders page that duplicates it wel that doesnt really matter if its relevant to the history of the show but Im not sure what would duplicate it  maybe parts of the critique section Dont worry about duplication Sometimes topics overlap and there is duplication Just look at Who Killed Archie and EastEnders Live A fair bit of duplication between those two articles  talk
