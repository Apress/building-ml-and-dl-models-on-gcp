The solution to this is very simple Find a source which says this isnt genocide If you cant then the article cant say that it might not have been genocide Do you think youre the only person who has ever wanted to write something that cant be supported by WPRS I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious But WPRS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest
To address your criticism of the article I point out that governments for obvious reasons are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim Even Hitler didnt issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe That doesnt mean that the Holocaust wasnt genocide They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this
