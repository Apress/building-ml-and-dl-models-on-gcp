Kbks proposed changes 

I reverted two changes by Kbk so they could be discussed here first

First he removed the two sentences describing pseudoscience
 by asserting claims or theories without first verifying them in experiments
 by asserting claims without supporting experimental evidence

Second he removed cold fusion from the list of pseudosciences and added it on the protoscience page on the basis that it is actually a protoscience
