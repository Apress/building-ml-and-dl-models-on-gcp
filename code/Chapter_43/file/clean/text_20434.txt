How about This

How about just wait until the game gets released  I dont think its fair to call the game simply a port when it is adding on two new characters  Not to mention new content  Fully voice dialogue etc  Theres no arguing that this is basically a remake of So2 but its also adding new features  Therefore I dont think its a port but its not the same game either  Its somewhere in between  Its a remake with add ons  If Yamagishi wants the remakes to feel like two totally different games then why dont we treat them as such until we find out otherwise  This is even MORE TRUE for First Departure  How on earth can First Departure be a direct port of Star Ocean when it has the Star Ocean 2 battle engine  According to these entries and some other news Ive read it seems that both of the remakes have a fair amount of new things  Being a triace fan since 1998 Id advise you probably just wait  This isnt just like comparing Valkyrie Profile and Valkyrie Profile Lenneth  This is much different
