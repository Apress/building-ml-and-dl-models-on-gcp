Drug abuse 

Before I attempt to do a major revision on this article I would like to get your opinion on the title I notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article It seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction What do you think If you disagree in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go and what topics do you think it should focus upon I was thinking it could examine the scientific poltical and social aspects Viriditas

I believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article which is a redirection to recreational drug use  It could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted NPOV term and having appropriate redirects

I agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article but then such an article substance abuse should also include information on alcohol abuse which currently has its own page as alcoholism

The drug addiction page has some POV problems  What should be done here is to leave drug addiction itself under the domain of Addiction and rename the drug addiction page with all its references to brain chemistry and method of action to Drug dependence  Anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page

Im more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper NPOV naming even if they are stub articles as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages

My vote would be to make substance abuse its own page talking about substance abuse in general and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances ie alcoholism  Specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages  Im certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages

Im certain that some will be opposed to separating the good and the bad of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages consider Alcohol  Alcoholic beverage  Alcoholism but if alcohol is treated that way then other substances deserve the same consideration

If people disagree then Id argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined   2323 13 Apr 2005 UTC
