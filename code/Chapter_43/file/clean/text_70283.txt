Andrey Kashechkin photo 

Hi  I just edited Andrey Kashechkin to include an image in the infobox and its of him in Astana team colors but is a sixyear old image There are I think five images of Kash in wikimedia commons we could draw on the one Astana shot and then four Lampre pics The Lampre ones are higherresolution and one of them is quite wellcomposed imo but of course Kash no ride for dem nomore Can you help me discover consensus should we use the old Astana image or a nicer newer Lampre image even though hes not on Lampre anymore 

Let me know your thoughts Grazie x2
