The Smiler 

I was reverting it to what it was originally but made spelling mistake puting SNBO instead of SBNO my last edit to fix that typo accidentally went over someone elses S

Anyway
I agree with what was put there originally SBNO It cannot be put as testing as we have no reference to say that is being tested Standing But Not Operational describes exactly what we know its standing and its not operating And there are 3 or 4 references in the delayed opening section of the page which cite that information that it is finished and not operational
