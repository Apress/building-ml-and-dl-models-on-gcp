I have come on here one more time peacefully to try to engage you in meaningful conversation If you do not respond this is fine so please dont consider this an attack on you personally etc I need to understand why you think that propaganda can be limited to political and military uses Propaganda can be used by an industry When I looked back at your edits I noted you claimed that my inclusion of the tanning industry and tobacco industry was to garner attention for a product he thinks is bad for people Mr Jensen I do not have to think  anything as this is not an assertion it is a fact When an industry pays other organizations to publish material that is misleading and untruthful to serve their purpose is this not propaganda If you can provide further resources to help me understand what propaganda is then I will be happy to read them and then maybe I can see why you refuse to include the propaganda imposed by the tanning industry If you cannot then I fear that the individual entrusted with safeguarding the integrity of such an important page has not done their due dilligence before dismissing the careful work of others This is all I ask and I believe it is reasonable for me to do so considering the fact that you took this to the point of banning me from contributing to wikipedia
