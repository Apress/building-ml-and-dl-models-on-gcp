You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a rule and the MISAPPLICATION of a rule   or do you not concede that hypothetically a VALID proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED andor MISAPPLIED  Merely citing the RULE is pointless when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule
 Further Dodo violated WP rules by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop  He also misapplied a rule claiming that something I said must be verifiable  But what does it mean to be verified  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably scientifically TRUE  I claim quite to the contrary that since the article involved is Jim Bell subject ME that the only verifiability issue is this  Did James Dalton Bell ACTUALLY make these claims  Or conversely and hypothetically is someone else forging his identity etc   For example there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts  Rather somebody preferably one familiar with LOGIC could have said Bell how do we know that you jimdbellqcom is in fact the jim bell James Dalton Bell who is the subject of the Jim Bell WP article  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that jim bell actually saiddid this To ensure that jim bell is not being libelled by a stealth forgery
In response I would have immediately said Good question  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent current photograph to the article which of course could be compared with other published even if not public domain photographs which are available on the web   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO  Rather than HELP a newbie to WP AND wait for a consensus and actually help VERIFY that jimdbellqcom is actually jim bell Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits  And he deleted ALL my edits not merely some portion which allegedly was not verifiable  I will give an example to the contrary  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case 9930210  In fact in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit 195 pages which has I believe LONG been posted on the Web  Probably CryptomeJYA  It as I recall makes exactly this accusation  So if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit which has been posted for perhaps 5 years  Or he would have said to me Bell you need to show a cite of your lawsuit  THAT would have been productive useful and helpful  As opposed to being hostile counterproductive and malicious   So why didnt Dodo do THAT   The answer is quite simple  Dodo is hostile counterproductive and malicious  Hes a control freak  Apparently WP attracts control freaks  Rather than being assisting supportive and helpful Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart
