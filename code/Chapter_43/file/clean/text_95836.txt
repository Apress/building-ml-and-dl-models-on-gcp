Please proceed to edit any and all parts of the Queen article in any manner you deem appropriate I have no interest in editing this article I stepped away from the computer I was using in the Universitys computer lab to visit the mens room and during this time someone apparently used my then open account at Wikipedia to make the changes you addressed Again please proceed to edit any and all parts of the article in any manner you deem appropriate I have no interest in editing this article

Please do not reply to this message It seems that the article in which you are interested was the only one affected and I do not want to clutter up my talk page or any other pages with messages about the article in question Please feel free to edit the page upon which this message appears by deleting this message in whole or part as you deem appropriate LexVacPac3
