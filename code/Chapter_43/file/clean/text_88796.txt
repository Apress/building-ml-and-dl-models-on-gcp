By claiming that the word Nair is derived from the word dog you are equating Nairs to dogs All you could find to support this bizarre claim is a rabidly antiNair piece of thrash written by a well known caste maniac Sadasivans sources are not taken as reliable by majority of the academics and most of them havent even heard of him If his sources are true then why it is not even mentioned in two dozen or more other books which refers to the etymology of Nairs As pointed out by many users above Sadasivan has made even more outrageous claims without the support of the sources from which he interpreted those claims And the less we talk about the edits of Sitush the better Here he claims that the Ezhava are Brahmins Since when did Dalits got recognized as Brahmin You are filling the entire wikipedia with misinformation and propaganda and you are banning anyone who try to point out the mistakes
