Hi Honey Miss Me 

We the AntiCensorship Committee in conjunction with the Protest Wikipedia Censorship Facebook page feel it is our duty to formally relay to you that we have no desire to participate any further in these games you play with peoples rights You were given a run for your money yesterday and that was epic as well as amusing on our end hee hee Anyway the protest will continue on but as far as you blocking us from editing your precious fabricated articles go we couldnt care less In fact we want to distance ourselves from this garbage dump completely since we know you spy on everyone who visits your site Sooner or later youre going to have to face the truth Until then you will live in that lie you call Helter Skelter and continue to play the fool Enjoy
