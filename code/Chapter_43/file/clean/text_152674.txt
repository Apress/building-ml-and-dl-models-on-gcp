Also whereas I agree with your description of how material has to be included in WP I take exception with Michael Johnsons comment above There are several authoritative scientists who disagree with the mainstream of peerreviewed papers The reason why theyre not in so far is essentially decided on an interpretation of WPWEIGHT As with any rule interpretation it is liable to be soft and subjective and this is this interpretation that good or wrong has so far been applied by a group of editors
So there could be a criticism section in this article per WPs rules Gravity has one It all comes to how WPWEIGHT is interpreted and who interprets it
