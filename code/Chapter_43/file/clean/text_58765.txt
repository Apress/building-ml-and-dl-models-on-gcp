Your typical semireligious or nonreligious  Jew cannot relate to being a Christian To them that that term synonymous with being a gentile  something very different So tarring all Jewish believers as Christians meaning Gentiles is a rather transparent attempt by hostile forces to this movement to thwart their attempts at evangelizing Jews
That more than anything related to accuracy or theology is why these forces INSIST that Messianic Jews be called Christians
