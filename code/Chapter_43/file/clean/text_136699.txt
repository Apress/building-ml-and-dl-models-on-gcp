R is the series resistance component in the equivalent circuit model of a nonideal transmission line and G is the shunt conductance in the same model  Physically the R and the G arise due to completely different reasons  R is due to the small yet finite resistivity in the nonideal metal conductors of the line whereas G is due to the small yet again finite conductivity of the nonideal dielectric material between the metal conductors of the line  Therefore in a lossless transmission line where the metal is a perfect conductor and the dielectric is a perfect insulator the metal exhibits no resistivity and the dielectric exhibits no conductivity  Hence the characteristic impedance of the lossless line reduces to Z0  sqrtLC

To look at it another way the nonideal metals and dielectrics that are used in transmission lines which is practically the case are the root cause of signal distortion but by implementing Heavisides condition distortionless transmission lines can be designed even with lossy materials

NOTE  I keep using the terms lossy and lossless  Lossy simply means the transmission line has some R andor G associated with it and since any resistance when none is wanted or conversely any conductance when non is wanted results in loss of some of the energy of a signal a signal propagating through a lossy transmission line will lose some energy  On the other hand a lossless ie perfect transmission line will cause no loss of signal energy
