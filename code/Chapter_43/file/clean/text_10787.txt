The evidence speaks for itself The editor in question sneakily edited the abovereferenced page after he asserted a claim on a referring page for the obvious purpose of modifying the original contents that supported my claim  Furthermore there would be no need to add a citation to my edit on the page if the original wording on the page had not been tampered with  I agree on the necessity to collaborate but the editor in question dismissed that possibility by his engaging in that certifiable  and in some situations criminal  act  There are just some individuals that will go to any extreme in order to manifest their agenda and are in the end incorrigible I know the brain regions involved
