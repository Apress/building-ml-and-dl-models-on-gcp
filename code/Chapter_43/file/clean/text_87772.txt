Particularly obscure 
I was just wondering about the description of Im Not There as being particularly obscure Before being released on the Im Not There soundtrack it appeared on both The Genuine Basement Tapes and Tree With Roots bootlegs which are in widespread circulation among Dylan fans and it doesnt seem to me any more obscure then the dozens of other unreleased tracks on those bootlegs In fact it got a lot of ink in Greil Marcus Invisible RepublicOld Weird America and I cant remember off the top of my head if Clinton Heylin talks about it a lot but I always thought it was quite famous in its own right as one of the great unreleased Basement tracks Well its possible that is just my perception but I think if in doubt we should lean towards neutral language and simply refer to it as a previously unreleased track or something like that Or directly quote Marcus or Heylin or someone for a description of the song
