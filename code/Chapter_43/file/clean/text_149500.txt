Thanks for posting the notice in TalkPriština 
I share Húsönds rational for opposing the move despite the University of Prishtina precedent where I just dont dare to tread 
As discussed in TalkPriština I find that Pristina is just a simplified version of Priština widely used because of mainly two factors lack of š in English and most keyboards and political neutrality In fact the very same people who write Pristina pronounce the word with the šsh sound In my personal opinion and in Húsönds words diacritics are a more perfectionist and educative way to display the name
As for the official website check the Welcome to Kosova section not to mention the History section 
1965 Prishtina Airport was officially opened and initially was opened for domestic flights only
2000 Airport Prishtina initially has begun its operations and other airport matters with 45 employed workers in total
I cant stress enough that my opinion has nothing to do with taking sides in the current Kosovo conflict which I would solve by moving the entire population of the Western Balkans to Antarctica and giving the region to the penguins  who probably will change Prištinas official name to something in the lines of Tekelili
Best regards
