Hi Tom  Funny one  

I dont see the note below that you refer to

As far as insertion of the info in the lead sentence see the note above our conversation for my thoughts  The Wiki policy that I refer to which is the focus of some people who focus more on their view of required format than they do on what is AWK no doubt largely causes this problem  I expect you dont have a problem with mention that someone is Latvian say in the lead  and do not view that as AWK  And as you and our colleague in the above discussion point out it was seem nonAWK to say Jewish or Jew either before or after the reference to Latvian  But where some peoples reading of the Wiki format direction stops us from doing this we are necessarily forced into a more awkward presentation  What you say looks feels very awkward

If I want to satisfy the formatismostimportant people and I want to satisfy the AWKismostimportant people and still wish to reflect simply in the text that someone is Jewish with no greater emphasis than mention of the fact that they are Latvian I find that at times this can be challenging depending on whether the interested parties wish to make the article better or just like deleting or reverting the info without putting it in a form that works for them and others

There are I expect one or two other groups of editors out there  One group just wishes to delete mention of the fact generally that people are Jewish  Another group wishes to delete mention of the fact that people are Jewish if they believe it will help  or hurt  the image of Jews that they wish to propogate  These two group I expect do not indicate what their true interest is but cloak their arguments with psuedorationale argumentation

Personally while I personally support reflection that people are Jewish especially in the area of sportspeople I would not delete such a reference where the person in question is not one that the Jews might be proud to call their own  If it notable as measured  and this is important  by reflection of the fact in multiple sources that are reliable and not connected then I have no problem with good or bad people being identified as Jews if that is the case  the same as I have no problem with them being identified as Latvians

I appreciate your comment that you are not trying to ethnically cleanse articles as you put it

I just had some people delete a category that I created Jewish figure skaters  It was deleted despite the fact that attempts to delete Jewish sportspeople and Jewish fencers with largely the same arguments recently by the same people did not result in deletion  That is now up for deletion review  If you could give me any thoughts as to your thinking on how to address this issue that would be great as well

Cheers  Have a great weekend
