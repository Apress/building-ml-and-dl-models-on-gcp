I got the information from a very realiable source a muslim that Naik has recently married again and he presently has two wives  But I am not sure if it is indeed true  In any case him having two wives is NOT in the article

If you want to hear Zakir Naik saying that polygyny favour women listen to his talk on The Rights of Women in Islam part 4  Someone asks him about this specifically during the question and answer period
