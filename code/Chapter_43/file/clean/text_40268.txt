Most of the cites of Masseis report relate to the determined conclusions of the case That is my point exactly Determined conclusions are not facts  The report uses its determined conclusions to justify the convictions Thus those determined conclusions are  assertions about a living person  and as such are clearly prohibited  No one should need to bring anything to the table in order to ask that the guidelines be respected and applied equally to everyone WPBLP Misuse of primary sources Surely you must understand that this is the report the court uses to justify the guilty verdict When you try to justify something you are putting forth a onesided argument It is a biased primary source and I fail to see how anyone could consider it otherwise
Try this on for size It says on the injusticeinperugiaorg site that All of the credible evidence in this case points to Rudy Guede Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito had nothing to do with this crime  If you dont accept that as a RS then will you bring something to the table and provide an alternative that says the same thing I believe that is the same as what you are saying by demanding others provide alternatives to what you would like to use as an RS
Now if I am misreading you and you only want to cite Massei to say what the court concluded and you are careful to express that distinction that is different and I dont see a problem with that Just please dont try to refer to the conclusions as if they were facts from a RS I am not interested in emotional rhetoric either and I will not attack or be drawn into a fight with you  or continue an IS NOT  IS TOO argument trying to have the last word I simply say what should be obvious the article should not contain any contentious information about any living person that uses the Massei report or other court document as a source unless it makes clear that it is only the courts conclusion Ive been speaking in generalities Id like to see others who are more knowledgeable than myself be able to discuss specific examples without being drawn into emotional confrontations and blocked When Ive had the time to analyze the article more closely
