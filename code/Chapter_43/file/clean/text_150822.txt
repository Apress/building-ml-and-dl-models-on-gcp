You personally may not have edited the List of collective nouns for birds page but someone on the IP you are currently using which is a BT Broadband IP did at  As the IP you are using is one of the ones that BT Broadband assign to any of their users someone else using BT Broadband was obviously using it at the time To prevent future occurences I would suggest that you create an account which has a number of benefits one of which is that your user name is associated with any edits you make rather than the IP preventing such confusion
 The edit in question is the only edit made using that IP other than the message you left above  unless any other contributions were deleted which would not show on the user contributions for 86129151136 list
 Sorry for any confusion this may have caused   Contact Me My Contribs
