The warning you gave me 

I did provide a reason in the talk page the entry was redundant because someone had rewritten the section but forgot to delete the old section which they had edited The old section referred to a cancelled military vehicle which had already been discussed and linked to on the page In the future please actually check to see if there is a reason being given on the talk page instead of deleting it
