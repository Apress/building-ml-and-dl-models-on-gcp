An idea can not be unscientific  Methodology can however  The arguments against Hoaglands methods of forming conclusions are justified  Ruling out planetary migration on the other hand is unscientific  The reality is that we are sending ever larger and more sophisticated payloads to Mars  Assuming technology continues to move forward those payloads will eventually be able to handle life support and such  The US government thinks they can get people there in the next 15 to 20 years  Nothing in Physics rules it out  Your original entry seemed to attempt to criticize his methods valid but failed when you muddied the waters with the unscientific implications about what is possible and the totally misplaced Panspermia definition Hoagland never said anything about that 28 June 2006
