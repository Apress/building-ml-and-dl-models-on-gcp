Wrong country data on EUROPE PAGE 

I saw that data of armenia Georgia and turkey are not correct I can say more they are not even close the numbers are just so different that they dont even make sense for example for Turkey the area was saying 24ooo while for georgia 2000 when in reality it should be more than 783ooo for Turkey and 69700 for georgia The population is entirely wrong too I tried to fix it but dear USERHUSOND who probably has some personal problems with me after the recent dispute undid my change and now its showing the wrong data again could someone please take care of it I think he has to concentrate more on the corectness of the article than the person who makes them 

HUSOND the data on that page that I was trying to fix and you reverted is entirely wrong Georgia armenia azerbaijan  that is NOT their actual teritory and population I urge you not to change the data correction just because it was me if you will look at the list you will see that the numbers are entirely WRONG you dont have to believe me just go to the page of one of the countries and see that the actual data is very different
