Response to Seite following from the request on my talk page  youre attempting to apply a contemporary usage of a highlycharged and loaded term to a historical situation

Please read about the history of the Second World War paying close attention to the scale scope and intensity of the actions of both sides as it drew to a close  Both sides used every weapon they had available in that colossal deathstruggle  Nothing about the actions of either side is comparable in any way to terrorism in the common sense in which that term is used today  I would not even use the word to describe the Blitz the bombings of Coventry the destruction of Rotterdam or even the ovens at Auschwitz Its the wrong word

Once standard reference works on the Second World War use the word terrorism to describe those attacks then we may cite it and use it until then it is an original coinage original research and a violation of Wikipedias neutral point of view policy  Thank you  talk
