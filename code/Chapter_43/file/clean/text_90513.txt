Objection to removal of text in real prices and ideal prices article

I object strongly that you have removed chunks of text without proper explanation and discussion of your reasons in the real prices and ideal prices article It seems as though you are on an ideological campaign to cut stuff out of articles which you happen to think is rubbish You have to prove it is rubbish not simply autocratically remove material because it doesnt fit with your ideology You are not an expert on this topic so tread carefully and discuss your proposed changes
