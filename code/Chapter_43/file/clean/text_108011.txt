Courtney Here are my suggestions from my Peer Review of your article Chunking Psychology  by Dan Hurlburt
Considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor I just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review

The lead section provides a good stand alone summary of Chunking in psychology  The article already has a strong intro that didnt require much editing in the form of adding new material It did however require some fine tuned modifications that I think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific  The contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed   The terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand  One sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is Runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile or other distances times May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across  In the Short term memory section the sentence  The short term memory processes stores information for about twenty to thirty seconds  I think needs a word or two added in in order to complete the thought I tried to include a suggestion     May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across  She relates to her references where it seems necessary  Even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information  Grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article  One area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory possible link to Short Term Memory but I dont think that it is necessary since she does explain it a little using a reference  Her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article  I dont think that any images would enhance the article considering the article already provides a good diagram that is explained well and fits the topic nicely
