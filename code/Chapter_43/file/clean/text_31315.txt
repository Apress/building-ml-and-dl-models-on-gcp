Tony dont be coy about this We both know youve been involved in a lot of the dispute about userboxes Furthermore I have no way of verifying that the users you are picking as active are users who are active to you or are active in general Using SQL would be a far better way The other contentious point of your survey is that you designate contentious userboxes You further define these as political religious or  polemical However Im not sure how you would be objectively defining these characteristics This has been the subject of some discussion on the DRV subsection regarding userboxes In order to convey an objective trend you really need to have metrics And in order to have metrics you need something like SQL You cant present evidence which is solely from what Ive seen the sky is blue A photo is required Â aatalk
