Do not restore Wenner quote in Bob Marley article 

The quote is erroneous It is egotistical and serves Wenner not Marley Reggae is not mystic music it may be called spiritual  mystic may seem to have the same meaning as spiritual but its loaded with ideas of magic and other such mystic rubbish  palm reading crap

He did not have anything in common with John Lennon especially the nonsense lyrics that Lennon engaged in to insult his sycophantic fans something Marley never did And Marley would not say we are bigger than God and that religion will end as Lennon did Let alone write a song about his mother as Lennon did which sounds like Lennon has issues

Bob Dylan is nothing to do with Bob Marley  if you added him to the Hendrix article then yes because Hendrix was a fan

The quote is typical of magazine publishers It is designed to serve them A good example is the recent Rupert Murdoch quote This is the humblest day of my life that led to him receiving a custard pie in the face It was not his humblest day and he was at the inquiry because there had been a serious breach of civilized behavior from the editors of his publications 

Pack it in If Wenner wants to promote this magazine then let him take a full ad out in the New York Times

Do not restore the erroneous quote
