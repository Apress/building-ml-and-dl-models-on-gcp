Swmapyank not knowing that you had ever downloaded this file in 2008 I went ahead and downloaded the same image in 2011 and this version of the image is properly licensed and has also been used in eight or more articles  For this reason would you like to just let your file get axed and then use the other file for your RI Constitution article  You can go to the article Royal Charter of 1663 to get the file name
