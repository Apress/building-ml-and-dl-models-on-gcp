Forbidden City  

I did some work on Forbidden City The main issue I see is that you use a LOT of words to present simple ideas and some of it is rather confusing For example I did not work on this paragraph 

The programs include nine pieces most of them ancient melodies that also try to express the reflection of life One of them is Jackdaws playing with the water an ancient piece from Han dynasty that evokes a scene of a group of birds that play with water during a cold day It is a metaphor of the optimistic persons in spite of the lifes problems A faint perfume from the poet Jiang Kui4

Becuase I do not know what it means especially since you describe the two programs very differently in the paragraph just above it
