I see your concern a better article is what I am concerned about too Ive dealt with numerous kinds of text I know well about text structuring and an aspect drawing my attention striking is the linear style of the narrative and the aseptic surgical tone with onesided arguments piled up one after the other as a CV resum√©e can be failing to present the real extent of his actions not presenting critical approaches to his work or positions despite his being severely critized by many reputed authors and groups quite a lenghty criminal record is alleged Formal rigidity covers up the real content wasnt that actually what the Pentagon Papers were about Just wondering   

I share your concern with the cohesiveness the paragraph I embedded refers to the Vietnam War context when he was in charge and is intended to clear up what his profile is both at the specific moment and in general as a person and dont intend to delete his medalsmerits from the article but offer a critical and balanced approach in the argument completely different subject well it is directly related to the matter so the reader can get the whole picture A domestic issue Yes and no the course of events at home were eventually to prompt the USA pullout so both are interacting I accept suggestions anyway for another collocation or section for the paragraph in question Thank you for mending Ellsberg may not be a highranking official and needs a fix there may be a proper word I am not familiar to midranking official Ill look into it Topsecret of course they were The quotes are telling I cited what the Papers revealed so that the reader gets the picture My claim of not editing is just a mirror of your claim Like you I have a clear position as to the kind of figure and person Kissinger is but I do not intend to make an article based on my point of view just to balance it and offer a more realistic picture of the person in question reality is dirtier so to say As I told before this is not a CV
