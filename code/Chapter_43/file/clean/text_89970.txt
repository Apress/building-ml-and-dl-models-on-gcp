DISCOVERY August 26 2007 Respected reader and Wikipedian As yet I do not know how to handle this problem In reading the above line of
Wikipedia text testing formatted lines by example from different Internet Browsers Windows Explorer and Mozilla Firefox both latest version 
my computer shows that Firefox presents just plain ASCII characters type 0 ò  and 2 zooming the text in Ctrl with NUMPAD for greater and
NUMPAD for smaller  my computer screen shows that Windows Explorer but not Firefox partly vandalises the text the right part e
disappears and merges with the left part
