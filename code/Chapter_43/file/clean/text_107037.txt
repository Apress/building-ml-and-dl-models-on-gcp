Hiatus White Feather new members 

I believe the article should have the band as on hiatus from August 2008 to February 2009 or even later As the band have been inactive since August until February it should be considered a hiatus while Stockdale looked for new members As they have now played their first gig with new members Feb 6 the band should be considered active again Alternatively they could be considered active again when an official statement is made revealing new members So options
Wolfmother are active from 2000present
Wolfmother are active from 20002008 Aug Feb 2009present or
Wolfmother are active from 20002008 Aug Marlater 2009present
