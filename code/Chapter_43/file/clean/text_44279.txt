Apology 

A message from my talk page
I can see now I was placing my personal feelings on a golden pedestal and making them the driver of my outbursts Hell i gnored the note of civility on the top of this very talk page I know my actions were unwarranted uncalled for and extremely immature Lashing out wony solve anything This could be the insomnia talking but i can see bright as day im in the wrong And i regret my actions

I apology Hodson for my truly unacceptable conduct I allowed the hurt i felt months ago come back as bitter anger and made me blind to the real problem I only hope that though you only see me as some 17year old you could see me as a 17year old who wants to try and do all he can for Wikipedia Will we be able to wipe the slate clean and move past this despicable part in our lives and maybe emerge from this as collaborators not squabblers   1251 16 January 2012 UTC
