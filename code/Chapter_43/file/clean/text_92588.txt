1 Lord Howe Island 2 Island nations 

1 Lord Howe Island is not in the list of Other notable island mountains Would someone like to add it I do not feel confident doing it myself Its highest point is 875m 2870ft Mount Gower

2 I dont understand the comments about Guam and RÃ¼gen as the list of Other notable island mountains never purports to consist exclusively of island nations right
