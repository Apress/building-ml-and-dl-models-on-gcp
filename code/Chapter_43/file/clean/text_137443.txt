Could you put it somewhere in the article rather than in the lede The lede should be brief and give an overview of the article rather than its substance Thats my concern with this whole lede I have little time to work on it but see the need Make more sense In any case Im switching the order of the sentence It needs to be clear that Hartz is making this claim rather than sneaking his name into the middle of the sentence Reads more honestly that way
