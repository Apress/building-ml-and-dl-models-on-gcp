IndoGreek Map

Hi PHG could you please give me a list of sources ie the books used for your IndoGreek map as it stands I do think your map should remain though I would just like to see the sources for my self to make sure the arguements used against it seem very weak with an ulterior motive ie out of xenophobia and antiEuropean sentiment Plus I dont think Narain should be considered as a reliable source in comparison with Tarn Eurocentric Oh come on Europeans are generally apathetic towards each other Busagali as he is Indian himself during an anticolonial xenophobic and patriotic era
