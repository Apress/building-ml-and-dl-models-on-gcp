Very funny You can count As I indicated I am backing out I spent many many hours of contributing to this thread over 12 months as an owner and enthusiast You came in without any subject matter expertise and deleted the last addition I edited my contribution down to mere bullet point facts and a link to a press release which are all over WikiPedia to accomodate the concerns and removed potentially questionable content You continued to flat out delete my entire contribution In the end I am no longer interested to spend my time seriously trying to contribute in an honest manner and  provide information and someone just comes in and deletes your contributions based on some reference to rules Maybe I was not fully in compliance Take a look that happens all over WikiPedia Now if an official WikiPedia editor would have come in and asked my to revise giving guidance thats something else But a self appointed rules enforcer repeatedly just deleting even as I was editing down is part of the end of engagement of the masses I am not here for an editing fight or posting war So long
