Content issues

There are emerging guidelines within the Indigenous peoples WikiProject that I have begun to apply across the board for BC First Nations  The main one is that there are different types of articles even when their content and locationpeople may seem to overlap Ill sign each sectionparagraph so comments on specific points can be made easily 
Ethno  Culture articles
Not as loose as it sounds despite having to describe it like this ethnohistoryculturepeoples
which this article as titled would fit into  These articles get CategoryFirst Nations in British Columbia with First Nation here meant in an ethnic sense not in a governmentalorg one  Ideally these will always be simply named without Nation appended as with Secwepemc and Nuuchahnulth  or Stólō  variable forms like Nuuchahnulthaht can be redirects although that term can include the Pacheedaht which normally wouldnt want to be called Nuuchahnulth 
Government articles
bandsFirst Nations tribal councils treaty groups which have governmentrelated content ranging from chiefs and councillors affiliations treaty issues modern demographics economic and social issues and so on  These articles get CategoryFirst Nations governments in British Columbia  In the case of the Stólō the main government article is going to be created in a few minutes Stólō Nation and will list all its subgovernments Indian Band and First Nation sometimes just Nation are all interchangeable although some bands seem to have a preference at different times given by variable content on various website sources whatever is picked  NonIndian Actbased governments can be and should described under different titles either in the ethno type or in the history type see below 
language articles
nuff said but can be titled either in native language Statimcets or in the form Shuswap language Wiki guidelines it should be stressed prefer the latter use English which is the language of the encyclopedia  Some ethno and gov articles will have more than one language listed in their cats some languages span more than one gov group or in the case of the Stolo and Chehalis two different ones  Cats for this are specialized in the linguistics hierarchy examples later but they should generally all take the relevant nationcategory if there is one CategorySecwepemc CategoryStólō CategorySyilx etc 
CommunityReserve articles
Communities reservesIRs towns that have significant native presence also there is a difference note between the physical object of a reserve and the band government that runs it the descrption of the reserve is here that of the government even though this will not just overlap with the government articles but also the ethnopeoples ones just interlink everything and it will sort of make sense its just a question of what was being searched for the Scwexmx and Spaxomin bands are all listed under Nicola Tribal Association for instance but the latter article is about the association not about the communities similarly Shackan and Nooaitch are communities as well as reserves but articles about them should focus on the communitys particular history not on overall Scwexmx culture  In the case of the Stolo there is another issue of where to fit the Chehalis as they are in the same culturallanguage area but they are not Stolo by organization or by their own appellation  Or the Tsleilwaututh who are culturally Skxwxu7mesh but are part of the Stolo Nation or were last time I looked so theres some confusing bits here and there
Mythology articles
UserOldManRivers has pointed out the mythology articles and the cats that go with them awkward wordingtitling but in the absence of anything more workable thats all there is for now
HistoryBiography articles
there is another sortof category for specific history articles eg Chilcotin War Fraser Canyon War and various bio articles Simon Gunanoot Slumach Klattasine etc where CategoryFirst Nations history would be appropriate as well as either CategoryFirst Nations leaders or CategoryFirst Nations persons theres also different cats like CategoryConflicts in Canada which may apply or CategoryWars involving indigenous peopels in North America which was specifically titled to allow internative wars as well as wars between native peoples and nonnatives and without the Native American wording that that category at one time had
