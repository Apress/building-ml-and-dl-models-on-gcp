Hey there my advice is never be afraid to be WPBOLD when you see blatant violations of WPOR I think you should remove the offending statements entirely because statements like amazing storylines to everyones shock which wouldnt be surprising etc are all matters of opinion not facts and thus can never be verified or cited
