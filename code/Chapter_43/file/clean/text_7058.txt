The interpretation of behaviour 
When a subject under questioning show signs of fear andor distress it could indicate the subject is not telling the truth The Othello Error refers to the fact that honest people may experience fear during questioning and show signs of fear while perfectly telling the truth 
In essence you can not rely entirely on signs of fear as an indicator of truth or lie You have to look beyond the signs
