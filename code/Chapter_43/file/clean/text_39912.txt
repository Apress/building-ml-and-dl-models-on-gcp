I say this as someone who is mostly Solutrean Neutral Cinmar point neutral and skeptical of the 1971 flint point found in VA that was French originating it was found in proximity to early American European population such people kept things around as curios Theres a lot to debate about Solutrean Hypothesis or archaic European man in North America Anzick1 does not disprove it Can we stop saying that please
