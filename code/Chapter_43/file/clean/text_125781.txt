The distinction of modern and classical hinduism should be made and FYI it was not my edit where one may see how consequent your disruptive behaviour is You are blaming another person without any substance just to discredit the others contribution This is so funny to watch whereas you havent a single argument to keep your personal views about buddhismrelated stuff in the hinduism article 
back to the factual conversation We could keep the BuddhaAvatar story in the article but it has to be in an appropriate context You have to show sources when and why this had happened to keep the history relevance Otherwise it would be a normal religious related sentence I just looked in the httpenwikipediaorgwikiBuddha_as_an_Avatar_of_Vishnu article where it says that in 13th century AD Buddha was included as an Avatar of Vishnu So where do you want to put it in the article for history of hinduism
