Apparently the dispute is over whether the term Greek Macedonians should be used to refer to the Greek Macedonians While it is a sourced term and is in use by academics as has been demonstrated above there is a strong refusal to including it The Greek insistence to including this term is primarily to prevent the much feared monopolisation of the name Macedonia by Fyrom whose editors oppose using the term for reasons I have difficulty understanding I have already said that Id agree to removing the term Greek Macedonians other Greek users havent if the disambiguation note were to be expanded so as to avoid the monopolisation This proposal was ignored
