Dismissed 

To Whom It May Concern I have responded to the recent activity above elsewhere and disassociating myself with Walter and this pagearticle as well as the IP for now since the content that was reverted is included within Wiki already on pages he does not watch and because I dont require the use of this IP to use Wikipedia nor is it important to get my way when I know Im right I will not return here or read any of Walters messages nor have I since This is only to justify my actions and prove my case which I have evidence of and saved for my records should it be needed for future reference To be clear the reverts and temporary block was unwarranted The user may not like hearingreading certain comments but that doesnt make them untrue He also misconstrues edit summary notes and took them personal which would only make them true if he is guilty of it Im at peace knowing the content is on other obscure articles which he can not revert nor have they been challenged by any others I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time with Walter and now I know to avoid this user as well as his supporters and continue doing the good work I have always done which has been provedaccurate I do not need the validation of users only wanting to create problems The unsourced and poorly written content within this article still needs to be removed per noticeboard discussions and Walter admitting it above himself although lying about Aboutcom being acceptable which I knew was incorrect already Please practice what you preach even though my research was correct yet still removed due to Walters personal preferences 9912911289
