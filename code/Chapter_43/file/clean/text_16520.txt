Historians are incapable of second guessing Hitlers inner thoughts 
There may be some who believe that historians are capable of deciphering Hitlers inner thoughts ie Hitlers religion  This is ignorance and stupidity  They write things such as while historians such as Ian Kershaw Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock agree that Hitler was antiChristian  They do not even provide quotes of Ian Kershaw Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock saying that Hitler was antiChristian  All they are saying is trust us in our opinion the opinion of Ian Kershaw Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock is that Hitler was anti Christian  A far better procedure is to rely on the opinion of Hitler himself as to his religion
