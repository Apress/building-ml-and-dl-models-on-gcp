User subpage for major revisions 

I keep trying to make a huge revision to an article but my comp keeps crashing and I lose all my sources open in other windows  I created a subpage to save it until its ready to publish but WikipediaSubpageDisallowed_uses says thats not allowed  I thought I read somewhere else that they recommend that and I know you did it soIm confused  Is it ok for me to use a subpage for a major revision   talk  contribs
