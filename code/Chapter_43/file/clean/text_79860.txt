So for a Church building to be shown on Wiki it needs to be a Grade II listed building or something Ive obviously missed a FAQ Was going to pad out the rest of the details but wont waste my time if it cant be included I think there are features that are striking to the building but not being listed apparently means its not worthy for inclusion on Wiki
