 Link to Article The Unknown Martin Luther King Jr  

This link Article The Unknown Martin Luther King Jr has twice been removed by one particular editor first with a remark in including the words Whats next a link to Stormfront which I do not understand and later to dismissing the link as racist which like many conveniencewords ending in ist can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion  I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism which I am sorry must be common in any article about a wellknown leader  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race if this is what racist means if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page  But it does seem to be biographical has some nice photographs and is wellwritten and reasonable and therefore of interest  As an experienced nonAmerican with no point of view on the subject of the article contributor to wikipedia I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest and contributes to understanding  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches and is the way to approach the truth like any scientific research it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect  we are all human  and I can understand that this might be the reason

Enough  Please can there be viewpoints on the relevance of the link to MLK   And consensus  Welcome from the editor mentioned above and others  Thanks    
We dont link to fringe sites such as AmRen without a very good reason and there isnt one here the article in question is an opinion piece by a nonnotable grad student and is of no particular value to the article Sorry you dont like the term racist but its an appropriate description for Amren This article gets a vast amount of racist vandalism  thats why its semiprotected  and nonvandalism pointing to racist sources is immediately and properly suspect  15
