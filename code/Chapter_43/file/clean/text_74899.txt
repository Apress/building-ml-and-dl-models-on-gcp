ANI vs AIV 

Yo Buffbills  Thanks for reporting the vandalizing IP Ive blocked  Just so you know though these kinds of things dont need to be reported at ANI we actually have a specialized board for them at Administrator intervention for vandalism or AIV for short Its a little bit quicker and easier to report them there  No worries though thanks again
