race 

I must first state that I am an AfricanAmerican  I have been a Jehovahs Witness for a long time and I can personally vouch for the fact that the statements made in reference points 72 and 73 are actually not racist at all  I understand clearly why they may seem to be racist when heard through the ears of one who is unfamiliar with our view of meekness and servitude but you must take my word for it that the statements did not indicate a belief that blacks are in any way an inferior race
