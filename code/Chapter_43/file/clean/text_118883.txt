ReverbNation is not a reliable source and I dont see any charting thereunless its the totally unclear Rank No7 The IP is probably the author sure but SPI doesnt link IPs to accounts and at any rate its nothing we cant handle Why not try AfD Not notable and purely promotional as far as Im concerned And if trouble persists the subject can be made to stop editing as a promoonly account if evidence warrants it
