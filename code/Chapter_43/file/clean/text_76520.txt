you have consistantly provoked the other side with your endless efforts in censorship of anything that even remotely disagrees with your view of events that occured during this tragic part of history By not accepting the immense suffering of Turks under the hand of the Armenians and the foreign occupiers you are in fact insluting the memory of these people This unfortunately has very much been the position of Armenians and their western supporters the fact that the value attached to the lives of non christians is far less important This sickening attitude goes on today you just have to look at dysfunctional Iraq where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been massacred in what conveniantly known as collateral damage If you had a more open mind and respect for others maybe this topic would look much better today If you are going to go back to your whining arguments of how the poor innocent armenians without provocation were massacred please refrain from doing so because we have danced to the tune so many times already
