This makes more sense to me  Mirvs comment is confusing to methe Christian God is never lowercase eitherthe English equivalent of a lowercaseg god is well god  So will we say Christians believe that their god God does X or Christians believe that God does X with perhaps an intro explaining who this God is  I much prefer the latter  I trust no Muslim would want the sentence Muslims believe that their god Allah does X but would prefer a brief intro explaining who Allah is followed by sentences like Muslims believe that Allah does X
