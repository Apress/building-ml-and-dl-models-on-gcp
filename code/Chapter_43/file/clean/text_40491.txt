TFD closings 

Thanks for helping out with clearing the TFD backlog However I hope you dont mind a couple of suggestions 
If you close a decision as keep please edit the relevant template remove the deletion notice and add a link to the debate that resulted in keeping it
If you close a decision as delete please list the relevant template in the holding cell at the bottom of TFD so that it can be properly deprecated and deleted
Please dont make closing statements as keep until Mediawiki updated unless you know that such an update is actually forthcoming
Please dont invalidate votes because they refer to uselessness lack of usability is a good reason for deprecating a template However as you correctly say ugliness is not  that would be a reason for editing the template
Yours adiant_
