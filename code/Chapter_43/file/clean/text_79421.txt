Ive reverted the recent official and country of origin info in the infobox  As mentioned above BL was a synthesis of East  West Hong Kong  Hollywood  The BL Foundation is a California nonprofit corp so should California be the country of origin  Moreover the BLF is dedicated to BL as a whole not just JKD  So is the BLF the official organization which oversees JKD  Not really  This aspect of the article is subject to lots of POV so ego stuff like official and country of origin is best left out if only because we do not have WPRS for it
