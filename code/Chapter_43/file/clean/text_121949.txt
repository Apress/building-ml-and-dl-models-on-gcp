Mountain infobox style 

Hello Regarding this edit A while back I got into the habit usually anyway of entering infobox parameters in the order in which they are visibly displayed on output It just seemed the natural way to do it 

I have noticed in your edits you tend to put the map parameters below location and range and above the coordinates I wouldnt mind doing it that way from now on but could you please explain if it is important for it to be in that particular order Or is it just a personal style preference  Talk to meStalk me
