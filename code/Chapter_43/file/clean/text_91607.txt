I removed the wikification around St Maol Ruadh in the history section as it was a red link  The sentence includes when St Maelrubha preached  by St Maol Ruadh in which appears to be two versions of the same name  Maol Rubha is a redirect to the Wiki article Maol Rubha which starts MÃ¡el Ruba pronounced mail Ruva  Maol Rubha MoRubhaMaRuibhe Scottish Gaelic spelling and is about the saint not the battle  Can someone confirm they are one and the same man and make an appropriate judgement please  Im aware of local sensibilities and as a Sassenach dont wish to tread on toes  Meanwhile Ive redone the wikification on St Maol Ruadh to go straight to Maol Rubha
