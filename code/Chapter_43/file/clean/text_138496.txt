Sorry for horning into your talk page but Im still drafting the remount service article and hope to do one on the remount concept as well Early on the Army decided that it was costprohibitive to maintain whole herds so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized after World War I but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West One thing the remount service is credited with as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 2025 years was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service This was because the Army didnt and couldnt buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didnt meet standards or were otherwise unneeded
