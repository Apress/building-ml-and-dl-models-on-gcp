As I posted in the discussion page of that page for calling Chinese state media as propaganda I can say the same for the western media  So unless you have something that proves the news as fake such claim would constitute your original research  In fact during last years Tibet incident western media has shown plenty of misinform misrepresent information see anticnncom for plenty of hard facts to support their bias

At the same time it is also ridiculous and insulting to consider it as propaganda  Should 911 report by the US government be considered as propaganda given its statements on WMD in Iraq are all lies  You can cite western media with DIRECT evidence rather than quotes or unaccountable statements to dispute it but removing the item simply because you think it is propaganda is POV
