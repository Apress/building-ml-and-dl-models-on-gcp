Well thanks for your welcome Dolphin but as a matter of fact I DONT like this place and Im sick and tired of being a Wikipedian specifically Im sick and tired of the political correctness and farleft bias prevalent in this place that even overrides common sense and factual accuracy  For example a while ago I was reverted and shouted down for calling Muhammad a child molester which he was on the War on Terrorism page someone recently deleted all mention of the Fort Hood massacre as a terrorist attack despite plentiful evidence of terrorist involvement and just a couple weeks ago   0344 9 July
