I think that may have just been a typo or an overzealous Californian writing the annual report WNYWs own site lists them as Foxs flagship as do dozens of other sites There has long been the concept of West Coast flagships though which are generally if not entirely the LA stations In any case it may be sort of a moot issue I mean come on were talking about the WB and UPN here They could pick a station in New Mexico as the CW flagship and it wouldnt really mean anything Theyre all still operated as independent stations that just happen to carry a couple of hours of programming off the satellite in the prime time What does it really mean to be the flagship of a real network anyway other than that it was either first on the air or located in the same place as corporate HQ or both
