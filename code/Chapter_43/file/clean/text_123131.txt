References on Akron Aeros
Thanks for your attention to the Akron Aeros article  However when I marked the article as unreferenced I was looking for the addition of either a References or Footnotes section  Including reference information in one of these sections gives readers more information about the sources used and places it in an area where most readers will be looking for such information  See WPCITE if for further info on citation  So while I appreciate the effort I would like to work with you to improve the citation in the article  How about it
