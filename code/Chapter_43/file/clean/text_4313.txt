In light of Mr Connolleys participation as one of the ninemember team running the RealClimate Web site and his undeniable history of as a Green Party activist there is simply no longer any way in which his partisans can continue to waffle about his most impartial character though effective  as a WikiNazi censor in support of socialist causes  he most certainly appears to have been The fact that this Connolley specimen has been poisonously influential in stifling the honest consideration not only of factual reality in general but the facts of his own personal history in particular is a telling reflection of the pure viciousness of the faction to which he belongs There is no longer any illusion of trustworthiness with regard to the question of anthropogenic global climate change on Wikipedia The site is dominated by a pack of liars staunchly suppressive of honest and wellsupported scientific fact on this issue as well as upon any other issue of a sociopolitical quality touching upon the preservation of individual rights 7112513014
