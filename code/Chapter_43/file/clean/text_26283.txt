Huh
Zionism is a national liberation movement
It doesnt matter if the term national liberation movement is sourced its still biased and many would disagree with that label I can give you dozens of sources accusing zionism of being racist or racialist but that doesnt really mean shit

Certain individuals and groups have seized on the term Zionism and have misused
English is governed only by its speaker so there is no authority to declare which uses of a word are incorrect Just consult Humpty Dumpty from Alice  POVused it to justify attacks on Israeluh what Do you mean attacks on jewsIn some cases the label Zionist is also used improperlyGuessas a euphemism for Jews in general by those wishing to whitewash antiSemitism as in the Polish antiZionist campaign and Zionology
Whitewash is POV
