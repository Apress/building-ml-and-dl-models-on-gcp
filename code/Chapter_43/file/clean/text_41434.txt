Its all getting confusing I believe Ashley Palmer is the actress who plays the girl in the exorcism video Micah and Katie watch The secondary article used as a source in the Alternate versions section states that in the version that began showing in wide release in theaters this scene was removed and the broken picture framedemon breathing on Katies hair scene was added Ive seen people swear left and right that both of these scenes appear in the movie they saw in theaters Surely enough people can confirm this here and we can begin looking into fixing the article The only information Ive found so far has been in forums and even on those there is conflicting accounts
