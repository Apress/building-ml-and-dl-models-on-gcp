Motorway service stations

I find it odd that someone who is prepared to write about a couple of obscure redundant reservoirs is fussing about the failure to delete motorway service stations I have seen in particular many UK railway station pages start as stubs and grow  there is no namespace competition for the space currently occupied by the articles  at least one  Watford gap  is fine I learn some new facts about Leicester Forest East just now I know that Tebay services in Cumbria is notable for a thing or three  sorry but I just cannot get my head around whatever you think the problem is There you go BTW AFAIK Wikipedia also seeks to be a gazetteer though I  cant substantiate that with reference to any policy  talk
