Beryllium spheres purpose

I love this movie to the extent that we made thermion outfits for a fancy dress once   Ive always pondered what the beryllium sphere was actually for  Reading around a number of possibilities for this are

 A neutron reflector  beryllium is good for reflecting neutrons
 A gamma reflector  beryllium is apparently fairly good at reflecting gamma rays too
 Some kind of inertial system
 Affects the spacetime continuum in a way suitable for warp drives
 High temperature and pressure confinement system

The reason I wonder is mainly because beryllium is an unusual material and is very toxic to handle so they NSCA designers must have had some special reasons for such an exotic material  The fact that an alien race produced a suitable replacement indicates it is practically a commodity in spacefaring communities  Is there any data connecting the performance of beryllium spheres with that of transparent aluminium
