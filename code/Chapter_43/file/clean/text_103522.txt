On shortening the article 
Re  Point by point
 Although Petluras was a junior partner ommitting Ukrainian participation is just as wrong as omitting Lithuanian part from PolishLithuanian Commonwealth
 rm of Some scholars  per WPWEASEL there are three citations for this and this is not contradicted by others so there is no reason to believe this is not the opinion of most if not all scholars
 I did restore the removal of some fact tagged claims this article needs inline citations anyway
 I dont believe the article gains anything from repeating claims of Soviet and Polish propagadna Soviet propaganda claimed thatThe Poles denied that We could such claims and counterclaims to virtually any article but whats the point
 Since we have the Controversies of the PolishSoviet War article I see no need for the discussions of claims who killedmaimedburnt who here The Soviet advance into Ukraine was characterized by mass killing of civilians As for Babel as discussed above in his books he presents the crimes of both sides and his selective usage is POVish But if we remove only him we get a POVed para with only Soviet crimes  hence the entire para should go
