Hawaiian Pacific Airlines 

Can anyone confirm that AWE bought their operating certificate from Hawaiian Pacific Airlines  Also was that the correct name for the airline or was it Hawaiian Pacific  I have not found any reliable sources to support this  However I think there is support that they did use the HP code before AWE
