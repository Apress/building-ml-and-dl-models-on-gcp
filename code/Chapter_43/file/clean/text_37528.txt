Most of the comments on that AfD were votes not counterpoints  Further how can you say that the article doesnt mandate deletion when they clearly never addressed the points of NOR and V  My greatest concern about the article is the associations with living biographies  In all of that debate they have not verified a single notable alumni member  This was the reason I originally nominated the article as they had associated themselves with Justice Rothstein of Canada  I can only imagine the kind of revert warring that is going to take place on that article when I continue to remove all of the uncited associations I hope this isnt the beginning of a movement to include every student club in wikipedia  As for your remarks about the closing afd despite the fact that I feel I did not have an opportunity to respond to the remarks posted I will let it go as I see your point about perception of points considered
