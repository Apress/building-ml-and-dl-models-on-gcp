Page Macedonia recent edit wars 
Even if generally you are somewhat of an unexpressed Greek supporter Id like to hear your opinion on the matter since the last consensus from 1210 12 November 2008 was interrupted with the POV edit term mainly used by Republic of Macedonia with no evidencesources submitted this page has been a target of several disruptive editors and revert wars   Despite the fact that we have submitted evidence that this is not a term mainly used by Republic of Macedonia Britannica  And many other international sources from Google Scholar  and there is not a single source or evidence that conferms this mainly used by Republic of Macedonia this disruptive revert editors have continued to push this POV
What is your opinion on the matter
