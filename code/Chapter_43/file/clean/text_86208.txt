Isnt Judy Wood a Dental Materials Engineer   

 Judy has some experience in that field but its not her specialty From her bio on her tripod page BS Civil Engineering 1981 Structural Engineering MS Engineering Mechanics 1983 and PhD Materials Engineering Science 1992 Virginia Polytechnic Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis Engineering Mechanics Mechanics of Materials Strength of Materials Strength of Materials Testing From 1999 to 2006 Dr Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson South Carolina Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech Dr Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 911 One of Dr Woods research interests is biomimicry or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties such as fiberreinforced composite materials and biological materials Dr Wood is an expert in the use of moir√© interferometry a fullfield optical method that is used in stress analysis Dr Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals conference proceedings and edited monographs and special technical reports Dr Wood started to question the events of 911 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told
