Unthinking automated corrections
Your edit summary  at the article GrotrianSteinweg characterised the bulk of my edits as unthinking automated corrections and you reverted them In general I find the principles of WikipediaRevert only when necessary worthy of consideration In particular I assure you they were not automated and are the result of some thinking In detail
the correct syntax for a reference invocation by name is as for any unary HTML tag to close it with a space preceding the slash 
the wikilink for Germany in the infobox is a case of WPOVERLINK
when using  the parameter  is unnecessary
the term Initial Interest Confusion is capitalised at its article and I presume with good reason
the template  is useful even for articles which currently already show all of that caterorys images as more files might be placed into that category in the future
I suggest you revert your edit additionally please consider WPRevert only when necessary
