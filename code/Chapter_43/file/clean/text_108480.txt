Yoga is a way broader philosophy and discipline in Hinduism than in Buddhism and Jainism In Hinduism Yoga means more than just asanas and pranayam For instance the Bhagavad Gita define 4 types of yoga  Karma Jnana Raja Bhakti  only one of which Raja includes asanas and pranayam Also though there is no consensus on this yoga may have existed even before the Vedas In either case the philosophy is definitely there in Vedas and Upanishads Hindu scriptures which predate Gautama Buddha or Mahavira Jain It makes complete sense to show the Hinduism infobox on top Another suggestion is remove the infoboxes altogether After all the article also goes on to discuss about influence of yoga on other religions like Islam and Christianity But showing the infoboxes in an alphabetical order does not make sense
