I havnt yet personally deleted the toys section  but I would have no compunction in doing so  It was truly worthless  Every car on the planet has had toys made for it  we dont go on about that in all the other car articles on WP because its not notable  I dont see why this one needs to be different  You can argue that the pinewood racer is cute I dont  but regardless this is an article about the actual car and the pinewood car gave us absolutely ZERO additional information about that  so it doesnt belong here  The criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia isnt not demonstrably wrong or ugly  the criteria is verifiably true notable and relevent   So a photo of a crappily made model of the car doesnt belong in the article  we dont have to demonstrate that its ugly  we merely have to ask whether its notable and relevent  IMHO its neither
