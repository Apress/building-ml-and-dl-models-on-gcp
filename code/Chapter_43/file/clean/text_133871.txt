Hmmmm 
Stumbled into this via ANI but have to agree with Piotr that such an edit is substandard to expectations on a seasoned editor at best Did you even look lower down and see all the cites and wikifying you discarded and didnt edit back in I get upset by any action which wastes anothers time herein as should we all See this for example were all volunteering discretionary time after all and I would have said something far more pointed Please do remember to respect others contributions and time when making any edit  nkB
