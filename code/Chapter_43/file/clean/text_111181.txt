Shapiro is no more notable than medical doctors who have had their licenses suspended or revoked  I can think of one doctor a former doctor of mine who had his license revoked for killing a woman with the improper use of anesthesia insurance fraud falsely advertising he was board certified when he was never eligible to be board certified and by the time the state attorney got involved which is what it took to get this doctors license revoked in ONE state three criminal counts of sexual assault  It took 9 years for this doctor to lose his license  It was in the local newspapers  Evidently this all wasnt enough for national news  And there is no political group called Overdoctored  Would any of you think this doctor warrants a WIkipedia entry  Sadly there was no news about state medical boards revising their ethics rules  This man is now in New York and of course not practicing medicine  it took awhile for the three other states in which he was licensed to catch up with him  Yet this man is not infamous  Why not  If a lawyer can be castigated in WIkipedia for misleading advertising why dont we just begin a whole slew of articles about other sleazy lawyers and doctors and accountants and  Is Wikipedia now a forum for releasing ones own dislike of a particular profession
