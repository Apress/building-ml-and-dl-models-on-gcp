First and foremost Lynda Kiejko won a gold medal and a quota in the 10 m air pistol and added her second gold in the 25 m pistol Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runnerup Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event In Kiejkos case she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol 

 Second I notice that you added Michel Dion of Canada Cassio Rippel already won a quota in the 50 m rifle prone Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events and he competes for the host nation this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion As per rules on the host country places these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period With Rippels victory at the Pan American Games the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS minimum qualifying score then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games

I hope that you fully grasped the rules and regulations on the distribution of Olympic quota In case you may have not clarified about this case I share you the link  Thank you
