Yes should be removed for two reasons 1 its a trivia section lazily tacked onto the end of an article  this isnt fun facts but an encyclopedia and 2 I cant see any references and any unreferenced material in wikipedia can be removed at any time 

This section has been tagged for some time now  I cant see any move to incorporate it Its not deletion that needs justification rather inclusion was never justified in the first place and should be justified before their return bit by bit
