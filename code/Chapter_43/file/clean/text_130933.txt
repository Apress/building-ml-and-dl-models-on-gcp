I honestly dont think conspiracy theories are encyclopedical you will not find them in Britannica Hispanica Encarta and unless clearly identified as such they violate WPUNDUE 
To say that the PSOE backed up the Madrid bombings which is different from backing the turmoil but even that even if sourced with a POV reference is not compliant with the other policies in Wikipedia Good faith has three unavoidable limitations CITE OR and NPOV Remember that what rings true or is a state of mind based on reports that turned out to be wrong in the end and cannot be fully verified cannot be included in Wikipedia If at all all sorts of conspiracy theories could be included and even there I have my reservations in a very specific article say 14M Bombing attacks at Madrid but not in the general Spain article 
 It would be similar to including a sentence in the History section of United States saying that the Bush administration was behind the 911 attacks according to some sources Or as you know there are hundreds of conspiracy theories of Spain against Catalonia of which I could find dozens of sources some of which to many people ring very true but they are not included in Wikipedia and probably should not as you would probably agree
But I would be more than happy to ask an administrators and other users with goodstanding for their opinion andor mediation if you like
