No Im not going to agree to that as the link in question does not contain any attacks or outings of users I actually signed up to Wikipedia Review the other day as the public forums didnt contain any outings that I could see for myself and even in the private forums I couldnt find any information that hadnt already been published elsewhere Why on earth would I follow rules that I dont agree with Especially rules that were formed as part of an ArbCom ruling that had no idea what would happen a few months later I dont really care if were not allowed to link to WR in other namespaces but when this idiocy spills over into the mainspace the only purpose it will serve is to make us look like spiteful navelgazers to the general public Will the average reader of Essjay controversy care if WR outs editors I doubt it and in my opinion it doesnt anyway Will they be interested in finding out how the revelations began I think so So Ill wait out my 24 hours thank you and the very first thing I will be doing when it expires is submitting a request for clarification to the Arbitration committee on this matter
