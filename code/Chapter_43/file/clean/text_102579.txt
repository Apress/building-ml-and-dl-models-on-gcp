Lets just wait and see what some other Editors have to say about this matter that dont live in Cairns before you change it back I ask this because when I used a newspaper as a reliable source to show the population of Thuringowa as 63000 people it was changed back and I was told that we have to use the ABS website and the 2006 Census figures I was also told this on the Townsville and Thuringowa Region population figures that I have at over 163000 if I use the source from the Townsville Bully and again when I made the change to the 163000 figure it got changed back within a few minutes and was told that I need to use the current Census stats and this is what I have done for years but now it seems that because it is for Cairns it is ok to use some story from a Cairns based newspaper and I think that this is wrong if you want to add the 140000 to the Cairns page that is fine but dont have it in the main infobox just add it in here The city is rapidly expanding with a population of 127438 as of Feb 20064 and is reliant on the sugar and tourism industries
Change the 127438 to the 140000 put as of Sept 2007 add your ref and Im sure this would be fine
But I would like to here what other editors have to say on this
Thanks
