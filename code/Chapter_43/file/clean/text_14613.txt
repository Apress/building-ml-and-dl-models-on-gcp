Unblock 

Hello Mike After thinking very long and carefully I have taken the for me unusual step of unblocking a user you blocked without consulting you first You blocked Helvitica Bold indefinitely giving the reason as Vandalismonly account I have looked at a sample of 20 of the users 153 edits excluding their user page and did not find a single one that I could conceive of anyone calling vandalism Even if there were vandalism edits somewhere among them that I missed this cannot possibly be described as a vandalismonly account The user page contained some silly editing and it might be debatable whether to call it use of Wikipedia for inappropriate humour or vandalism but at the most it might have justified a warning An indefinite block on a user with a significant history of positive contributions because of a silly user page seems dubious and for such a block to be imposed without any warnings is surely unacceptable If I have missed something which puts the block in a different light than that in which I have seen it then please let me know
