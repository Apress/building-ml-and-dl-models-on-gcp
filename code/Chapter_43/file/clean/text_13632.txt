As an editor you already know that RS is Wikipediaeditor shorthand for independent reliable source as in WPRS Every statement made in a Wikipedia article unless it is an obvious one like the sky is blue should be WPV verifiable policy meaning supported by independent WPreliable sources strong guideline The more extraordinary the claim the more reliable should be the sources See also WPVRS for a capsule summary In other words Wikipedia is not the authority which is speaking the sources are We paraphrase quote and cite them What you wrote has not been explicitly discussed in the media yet
2nd point we dont write about Wikipedia or internal matters unless independent reliable sources have done so to do so again sets up WP or an editor as an authority 
3rd point See WPBURDEN which spells out that it is the duty of the adding editor to cite reliable sources supporting the claim  If none exist the claim must not be added to a Wikipedia article
